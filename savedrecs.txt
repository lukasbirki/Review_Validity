Resist to Commit: Concrete Campaign Statements and the Need to Clarify a Partisan Reputation	JOURNAL OF POLITICS			English	Article						party reputation; competency signals; campaign statements; text processing	ELECTION PLEDGES; PRESIDENTIAL-CANDIDATES; ELECTORAL CONSEQUENCES; COALITION GOVERNMENTS; POLICY SHIFTS; PARTY; AMBIGUITY; CONTEXT; BRAND; PERCEPTIONS	Democratic accountability relies on citizens to anticipate future governing behavior. We explore the strategic incentives for parties to shape voter expectations by generating vague or concrete campaign statements. Using an English-language dictionary, we scale electoral statements from all industrialized English-speaking nations to develop a measure of concreteness. Concrete statements can create electoral risks from unfulfilled expectations. Yet, political parties have incentives to use concrete statements to clarify reputation uncertainty associated with unclear informational cues. Political context shapes these incentives. Incumbent parties tend to dictate concrete statements to balance attributed responsibility for government outcomes and signal that they are competent managers. Strong government performance, however, reduces the incentive for incumbents to be concrete, as favorable outcomes reveal competent management. Opposition parties are unconstrained from these demands. The research reveals how political parties actively manage and balance the information that voters use in order to adjust the informative value of party reputation.

JOURNAL OF POLITICAL MARKETING			English	Article						political marketing; brand personality; brand differentiation; political brands	IMAGE CONGRUENCE; DIMENSIONS; CANDIDATES; WEBSITES; PREFERENCE; ELECTIONS; MODELS; EQUITY; LEADER; STYLE	This paper investigates whether five English political parties are differentiating themselves based on the brand personality they are communicating through their websites. The relative brand positions of five English political parties are analyzed using Aaker's brand personality scale. The text from each party website is analyzed using content analysis and a dictionary-based tool. The results are plotted in relation to one another on a correspondence analysis map. We find that the two main dimensions on which parties' brand personalities differ relate to the trade-offs between communicating competence and communicating sincerity and between communicating sophistication and communicating ruggedness. We find that parties' brand personalities are distinctive, with the exception of the Green Party, and that the position of one party, the United Kingdom Independence Party, is particularly distinctive. Our research uses Aaker's existing framework for thinking about brand personalities, rather than creating a new framework for politics. By using an existing framework, we are able to use tools developed in other disciplines and show their usefulness for the study of political marketing.

This research note examines different methods for obtaining party positions on immigration in retrospective. Party positions are obtained using pooled expert surveys, manual coding of party manifestos with a conventional codebook, manual coding of manifestos using check-lists, and automatic coding of manifestos using Wordscores and a dictionary of keywords respectively. In addition, positions from a media analysis and a retrospective evaluation of researchers in the field of immigration are used. The results suggest that most methods differentiate the same order of party positions. While there are high correlations between many methods, the different methods tend not to agree on the exact positions. The automatic dictionary approach does not seem to measure party positions reliably.

In this article, we argue that politicians are more likely to employ positive affect (valence) in their rhetoric to appeal to voters when parties are not ideologically distinct and when there is uncertainty about public preferences. To test these propositions, our article uses well-established psycholinguistic affect dictionaries to generate scores from three time series of political text: British party manifestos (1900-2015) and annual party leaders' speeches (1977-2014) as well as U.S. Presidents' State of the Union addresses (1880-2016). Our findings corroborate our expectations and have important implications for the study of party competition by illuminating the role of valence in the way politicians communicate their policies.

Huge amount of unstructured data is generated from social media like Facebook, twitter, LinkedIn, which is repository of useful insights. Analytics can be applied to extract various useful insights form this. Main objective of this paper is to extract the knowledge from large social media data, identify the people sentiments and behavior to make cognizant decisions. Effective sentiment analysis of people emotions is necessary for complex topics like politics, government, present trends and healthcare. These objective are achieved by real time retrieval of twitter data and perform sentiment analysis. It helps to classify emotions of the people are positive, negative, happy, sad or neutral towards national parties of India (BJP and INC). Considering people emotions, parties can identify their weakness and look after improvement to fulfill society needs and work towards satisfying people requirements. Using text mining and unsupervised lexical method classified tweets related to these parties to identify people emotions for the parties.

These documents, which are addressed to party members and activists rather than the wider public, have been analyzed through quantitative text analysis of word frequencies. The results confirm that a few relevant changes occurred that involve the lexicon, tone, and content of messages. However, concepts such as left and right are still relevant, and we observed neither a strong decline in the use of ideological terms nor a wider usage of populist words. Despite the growing personalization of politics, the main political leaders are not frequently mentioned, with two exceptions: Prodi and Berlusconi. Overall, there is a distance between intra-party politics and the logic of entertainment.

Manual and automated coding methods drawing on 283 party manifestos are compared - manual sentence-by-sentence coding using a conventional codebook, manual coding using checklists, automated coding using Wordscores, Wordfish and keywords. We also use expert surveys and the Comparative Manifesto Project (CMP), covering the main parties in Austria, Belgium, France, Ireland, the Netherlands, Spain, Switzerland and the United Kingdom, between 1993 and 2013. We find high levels of consistency between expert positioning, manual sentence-by-sentence coding and manual checklist coding and poor or inconsistent results with the CMP, Wordscores, Wordfish and the dictionary approach. An often-neglected method - manual coding using checklists - offers resource efficiency with no loss in validity or reliability.

While scholars have provided vast anecdotal evidence of populists' plain speech style, the empirical literature on populist communication offers very few and mixed comprehensive evaluations of the complexity of elected officials' language. This paper relies on a novel populist dictionary and 78,855 utterances from the 17th Italian parliament - March 2013-July 2016 - to comprehensively study the link between populism and speech complexity. We argue that ideological and electoral considerations lead populist parties and politicians to employ a straightforward language. Moreover, we claim that party membership shapes the rhetoric of elected officials, leading members of populist parties to use a simpler language. Using computer-assisted text analytic techniques to inspect parliamentary speeches given by the members of nine Italian parties, we perform a difference-in-differences analysis of the influence of party switching on legislators' behaviour. Our results suggest that populist ideology, electoral strategy, and party membership influence legislators' language complexity. Our overarching conclusion is that language simplicity might be thought of as a feature of populist communication. This arguably has implications for the ability of populist actors to use a simple communication style to outperform their mainstream counterparts when competing for voters' support.

The corpus on which the investigation is based is constituted by the "Political document" of Podemos, available on the party's website. After a description of the linguistic features of that text, with particular emphasis on those of lexical-semantic character (with some relevant quantitative and statistical data), the discursive resources used to build the identity of the party are highlighted. The next step is to compare the characterizing features of Podemos's discourse with those provided by other recent studies on populist parties, to conclude that Podemos represents a political party with a clearly populist profile.

J	Konig, T; Luig, B				Koenig, Thomas; Luig, Bernd			German 'LexIconSpace': Policy Positions and their Legislative Context	GERMAN POLITICS			English	Article							POLITICAL TEXTS; PARTIES; GOVERNMENT; SIMULATION; SERIES; WORDS; SPACE	This article presents a new approach for estimating the policy positions of political actors in the German multi-party policy space. The approach consists of two steps, 'smart tagging' in the data generation process and Bayesian factor analysis in the estimation process. 'Smart tagging' relates the statements of political parties and governments to the keywords of German federal legislation, which we use to estimate the policy positions in portfolio-specific n-dimensional policy spaces. Our G-LIS approach (German 'LexIconSpace') provides several advantages for scholars evaluating policy-seeking theories, in particular by providing context-related variation of policy positions across portfolios and over time. Our findings for the portfolio of 'labour and social policy' reveal a two-factor solution which unfolds a latent 'resource' and 'value' dimension in Germany during the period from 1961 to 2009. We find changes in the policy positions of German political parties and governments, which existing approaches can hardly identify in n-dimensional spaces under the specification of the error term for each dimension and actor.										54	5	5	1	5	ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD	ABINGDON	4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND	0964-4008	1743-8993		GER POLIT	Ger.

The alleged link between populism and emotional communication has barely been subject to systematic empirical scrutiny. I use literature on populist communication and appraisal theory to generate expectations about which political parties use which emotional appeals. I test these claims by applying a novel emotional dictionary to a large set of text data including more than 700,000 press releases and tweets from three European countries. As expected, I find that populist parties use significantly more negative emotional appeals (anger, fear, disgust, sadness) and less positive emotional appeals (joy, enthusiasm, pride, hope) than mainstream parties. Furthermore, I find that political actors adapt the usage of emotional appeals to different purposes depending on the communication medium and the politicians' status level. This study entails important implications for the research on emotional appeals in politics and populist communication.

J	Ceron, A; Gandini, A; Lodetti, P				Ceron, Andrea; Gandini, Alessandro; Lodetti, Patrizio			Still 'fire in the (full) belly'? Anti-establishment rhetoric before and after government participation	INFORMATION COMMUNICATION & SOCIETY			English	Article						Populism; Facebook video; text analysis; political language; election campaign	RADICAL RIGHT; POPULISM; PARTIES; TWITTER; EUROPE; SYSTEM	Scholars argued that anti-establishment parties use a populist rhetoric that appeals to the worst instincts of people. Indeed, populist politicians are often viewed as charismatic leaders that have fire in their belly. While in the past these parties heavily relied on anti-establishment platforms and communication rhetoric, their increasing electoral success along with the growing duties linked with government membership transform them into more established parties, rather than pure outsiders, and cast doubts on the feasibility of keeping a populist rhetoric. This paper compares right-wing and non-right-wing populism, investigating whether populist leaders change their rhetorical strategy once in office, decreasing the level of negativity and adopting a more forward-looking and inclusive style of communication, with a stronger focus on fulfilling the policy proposal made during the electoral campaign rather than blaming political rivals. For this purpose, we collected a new corpus of political speeches extracted from video messages posted on Facebook by four anti-establishment party leaders in three countries (Austria, Italy and Spain), from 2016 to 2018, i.e., immediately before and immediately after their access to power. Overall, 30 h of recorded audio from 215 videos (amounting to around 140 million visualizations) have been analyzed using topic models and well-established semantic psycholinguistic dictionaries. The results highlight slight changes in the rhetoric of populist leaders once in power, mostly for non-right-wing populists, as their language becomes less negative, less assertive and more focused on government duties.

This study examines German counterterrorist legislation before and after the attacks of 9/11 by using a dictionary-based computerized text analysis. Our findings demonstrate that in times of low threat, the level of intra-coalition and bicameral conflict decreases the likelihood of counterterrorist legislation. However, in the event of a high external threat, this effect disappears despite the continuing divergence in partisan policy preferences. This suggests that a high external threat imposes inaction costs on political parties, which they attempt to avoid by adopting counterterrorist measures in the legislative arena.

Our main motivation comes from studies in comparative politics where one wants to locate party positions in a certain political space. For this purpose, several empirical methods have been proposed using text as data sources. As the data structure of texts is quite complex, its analysis to extract information is generally a difficult task. Furthermore, political texts usually contain a large number of words such that a simultaneous analysis of word counts becomes challenging. In this paper, we consider Poisson models for each word count simultaneously and provide a statistical method suitable to analyze political text data. We consider a novel model which allows the political lexicon to change over time and develop an estimation procedure based on LASSO and fused LASSO penalization techniques to address high-dimensionality via significant dimension reduction. This model gives insights into the potentially changing use of words by left and right-wing parties over time. The procedure allows to identify automatically those words having a discriminating effect between party positions. To address the dependence structure of word counts over time, we propose integer-valued time series processes to implement a suitable bootstrap method for constructing confidence intervals for the model parameters. We apply our approach to party manifesto data from German parties over seven federal elections after German reunification. The approach does not require any a priori information nor expert knowledge to process the data. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We analyze lexically all US presidential inaugural speeches from 1789 until now and use machine learning algorithms to learn patterns to categorize the authors of the speeches into their respective parties. We apply four different supervised learning approaches (Multinomial Naive Bayes, SVMs, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression) and evaluate their classification performance. The outcome is a 100% accurate classification based on our choice of lexical features (such as unigram and stopwords removal) and the parameters of SVM with linear, polynomial, and RBF kernels. Our study shows that the selected supervised machine learning algorithms can produce highly accurate association between political parties inaugural speech text without requiring any additional information such as metadata for authors or parties or semantics.

It is used to extricate, recognize, or portray opinions from different content structures, including news, audits and articles and categorizes them as positive, neutral and negative. It is difficult to predict election results from tweets in different Indian languages. We used Twitter Archiver tool to get tweets in Hindi language. We performed data (text) mining on 42,235 tweets collected over a period of a month that referenced five national political parties in India, during the campaigning period for general state elections in 2016. We made use of both supervised and unsupervised approaches. We utilized Dictionary Based, Naive Bayes and SVM algorithm to build our classifier and classified the test data as positive, negative and neutral. We identified the sentiment of Twitter users towards each of the considered Indian political parties. The results of the analysis for Naive Bayes was the BJP (Bhartiya Janta Party), for SVM it was the BJP (Bhartiya Janta Party) and for the Dictionary Approach it was the Indian Nathional Congress. SVM predicted a 78.4% chance that the BJP would win more elections in the general election due to the positive sentiment they received in tweets. As it turned out, BJP won 60 out of 126 constituencies in the 2016 general election, far more than any other political party as the next party (the Indian National Congress) only won 26 out of 126 constituencies.

This research note addresses the question to what extent the source language of a text affects the results. To do so, Swiss manifestos in German and French are coded automatically, comparing a keyword-based dictionary approach and Wordscores. Because of language differences, both stemming and particularly stop words are important to obtain comparable results for Wordscores. If both are used, the predicted scores are almost identical in both languages. With the right preparations, the challenge of language differences can thus be overcome.

Data for the study comprised 60 full-page newspaper election campaign adverts of the two strongest political parties in the country: the People's Democratic Party (PDP) and Action Congress of Nigeria (ACN) published between February and April 2011, a period that can be referred to as the peak period of electioneering campaigns for the 2011 elections in Nigeria. The data gathered were analysed using the analytical tools of critical discourse analysis, with emphasis on Fairclough's discourse as a social practice approach to the theory. Findings reveal that the text producers employed discursive strategies such as the metaphorization of party symbols, the use of deictic pronouns for inclusion and exclusion, deployment of rhetorical questions for persuasion, identification with the youth culture, employment of historical allusions, giving appeal to good luck, and negative other representation. In addition, the packaging of the information, graphological foregrounding, imagery, repetition and lexical choice reveal the intent of the campaign advertiser to persuade, appeal to sentiments, legitimize and delegitimize their positions in the discourse.

Frame semantics, a theory originating in cognitive linguistics, anticipates that prototypical situations are evoked in language users' minds each time a word is used. Thus, a "frame" for "'to situations" is reconstructed from Biblical texts.

The studied populist messages reflect ideational definitions of populism. Thus, populist messages appeal to the people, dismiss the elites as appalling, or highlight the people's right to unfettered rule. Despite German-speaking countries offering a variety of populist parties, existing automated approaches are rarely applicable to German texts. Furthermore, they are not tailored to social media and often focus only on anti-elitism. I vastly improved existing dictionaries by analyzing populist ideology in its entirety, including people-centrism and the demand for people's sovereignty. The article showed how known populist parties in Austria, Germany, and Switzerland spread these messages to a great extent on social media. Furthermore, I was able to highlight intra-party differences. Finally, the article discusses different aspects of validity and shows that the proposed approach offers high convergent validity and split-half reliability.

Despite the potential impact of the development of opinions during political elections, few studies have focused on the analysis of sentiment dynamics and their characterization from statistical and mathematical perspectives. In this paper, we apply a set of basic methods to analyze the statistical and temporal dynamics of sentiment analysis on political campaigns and assess their scope and limitations. To this end, we gathered thousands of Twitter messages mentioning political parties and their leaders posted several weeks before and after the 2019 Spanish presidential election. We then followed a twofold analysis strategy: (1) statistical characterization using indices derived from well-known temporal and information metrics and methods -including entropy, mutual information, and the Compounded Aggregated Positivity Index- allowing the estimation of changes in the density function of sentiment data; and (2) feature extraction from nonlinear intrinsic patterns in terms of manifold learning using autoencoders and stochastic embeddings. The results show that both the indices and the manifold features provide an informative characterization of the sentiment dynamics throughout the election period. We found measurable variations in sentiment behavior and polarity across the political parties and their leaders and observed different dynamics depending on the parties' positions on the political spectrum, their presence at the regional or national levels, and their nationalist or globalist aspirations.

Using Multimodal Discourse Analysis (MDA), the main objective is to investigate and analyse the graphic representations used in Nigerian political discourse as a way of deconstructing tactical misrepresentation and manipulative rhetoric in political discourse which is often a strategy employed in attracting voters. Lexical items, phrases, sentence constructions, texts, and symbols are also examined, alongside visuals, with the aim of understanding the contextual nature of the analysed campaign materials. The intention is to examine manipulative instances in the Nigerian political arena in the analysed materials. Through a purposive sampling strategy, a total of 12 selected campaign materials were collected across strategic places in Nigeria. The researchers focused on the data collected from the year 2010-2018. The collected data are analysed and thematically grouped. Findings reveal that politicians use different discursive strategies, among which the use of fiction; considering the state of the nation; as well as patronising the issues of service delivery, are included. The conclusion is that visual materials are powerful and capable of manipulating the minds of prospective voters.

The analysis aims to uncover how far such texts represented a departure from or a reaffirmation of the norms of the pre-Gorbachev era and, in particular, the role that they played in the Party's attempt to control interpretations of the 1968 Prague Spring. The investigation also considers ways in which the texts sought to construct a `new' reality in the light of the changes in the Soviet Union and other Warsaw Pact countries. The article maintains that the 'authoritative discourse' model represents an especially useful analytical framework for evaluating the impact of ideological language in the context of the Communist system. The model both helps to explain the relative acquiescence of most of the population, and also to track the extent to which the 'coded' message of the approved discourse was successful in slowing the demise of the regime.

To assess how well each algorithm works, each was applied on three datasets with longer texts from two different domains: transcribed multi-party conversations and written texts. After adaptation to the Arabic language, the test results show significant differences in performance depending on the types of documents.

Our feature-based algorithm combines knowledge about content using a text-based algorithm as a feature and about form using linguistic and acoustic cues about topic shifts extracted from speech. This segmentation algorithm uses automatically induced decision rules to combine the different features.

This paper focuses on the seven most popular parties competing for seats in the parliament. The analysis indicates that the use of language classifies as populism, a political communication style. First, we determine the timing of the election campaigns on Twitter, after that we categorize the posting times of the different direct candidates in order to derive ideal types from our empirical data. Second, use the Dictionary of Concerned Citizens which contains German political language of the right and the far right, to analyze the data with methods of text mining and social network analysis, and afterwards we display the results in a network of words of Concerned Citizen Communication Style (CCCS).

The presidential election in the United States is a hot issue that will affect various aspects of the world. The goal of this analysis is to forecast the outcome of the US presidential election and to compare these results with the actual results of the polls. The sentiment analysis used in this study is the lexicon-based sentiment analysis. The method used in this research is data collection, data preprocessing, data mapping and sentiment analysis. The data in this study were obtained from Twitter taken one week before the United States presidential election was held. The model used in this research is VADER sentiment analysis. The data cleaning mechanism in this study uses a method in text mining, where the data is first cleaned of various things that are not considered important in the analysis. Furthermore, the data that can he used as material for analysis is saved again to make it easier to read the data. In the analysis, tweets from users are mapped and counted by the state of the United States of America. The result of this research is a prediction for the Democratic Party to win 22 votes over the Republican Party which received 19 votes. The results from the BBC show that the Democratic Party won with 24 votes, and the Republican Party only got 20 votes. With these results, the VADER sentiment analysis model can produce predictions following the actual results of the US presidential election.

J	Zappettini, F				Zappettini, Franco			Taking the left way out of Europe Labour party's strategic, ideological and ambivalent de/legitimation of Brexit	JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE AND POLITICS			English	Article						Brexit; Labour; socialism; strategy; ideology; ambivalence; language; CDA	REFERENDUM	This paper investigates how Brexit was de/legitimised by different Labour actors in a corpus of texts published after the referendum (2016-2020). It thus contributes an intra-party perspective to understanding discursive dynamics of European (dis)integration by building on the notorious 'European question' historically debated inside Labour and on the polysemy of Brexit constructed by/reflected in such discourses. The analysis, conducted at lexical-semantic and discursive-pragmatic levels, points to distinct strategic, ideological and ambivalent forms of de/legitimation of Brexit in the discourses of Labour. While strategic and ambivalent de/legitimation point to the Brexit debate being mainly driven by political communication logics, ideological de/legitimation highlights a deeper struggle inside Labour over EU-rope, especially in relation to international vs. national conceptualisations of socialism. While EU-rope was de/legitimised (and Brexit legitimised) by advocates of 'socialism in one country', reverse stances tended to be adopted by supporters of 'international socialism'.

Many third-party NLP tools are currently available, each performing distinct NLP subtasks. However, it is difficult to integrate several NLP toolkits into a pipeline due to many problems, including different input/output representations or formats, distinct programming languages, and tokenization issues. This paper presents DeepNLPF, a framework that enables easy integration of third-party NLP tools, allowing the user to preprocess natural language texts at lexical, syntactic, and semantic levels. The proposed framework also provides an API for complete pipeline customization including the definition of input/output formats, integration plugin management, transparent multiprocessing execution strategies, corpus-level statistics, and database persistence. Furthermore, the DeepNLPF user-friendly GUI allows its use even by a non-expert NLP user. We conducted runtime performance analysis showing that DeepNLPF not only easily integrates existent NLP toolkits but also reduces significant runtime processing compared to executing the same NLP pipeline in a sequential manner.

J	Al Ghazali, F				Al Ghazali, Fawzi			Awareness of Critical Discourse Analysis Underpins Learners' Sociolinguistic Competence and Language Use	EURASIAN JOURNAL OF APPLIED LINGUISTICS			English	Article						Linguistic Competence; CDA; Language Use; Language Register; Sociolinguistics		As a special approach in discourse analysis, Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA) aims to study the discursive conditions and consequences of power abuse practised by dominant groups or institutions (van Dijk, 1995). It contributes to raising awareness of the discursive strategies employed by elite groups in order to control the minds of minor ones. It permits them to free themselves from the compulsions and limitations that deprive them of their right to think critically and have the freedom of choice. In the discipline of language learning, learners' awareness of CDA enables them to read critically and produce language in more logical manner. It is one way to empower them with adequate reading and writing strategies and to enhance their consciousness of using speech acts in meaningful context. This paper analyses a text following the framework of text analysis proposed by Fairclough (1992). The authentic text was selected reflecting one aspect of the British culture that does not have the common agreement of the ruling parties in the British community. It holds significant debate between representatives of the Conservative Party and the Labour Party that was taking over at that time. The analysis shows how the lexical and syntactic connotations reflect the attitudes of each Party and the newspaper publishing this article as well. The paper provides insights into how CDA can enhance learners' sociolinguistic competence and language use. (c) 2017 EJAL & the Authors. Published by Eurasian Journal of Applied Linguistics (EJAL).

I examine shifts to diverse genres (protest slogans, writing on social networks, personal conversation, a math exercise etc.), and analyze various discursive and para-linguistic strategies by means of which these shifts are implemented: use of registers and sociolects identified with particular genres; syntactical, semantic and lexical repetitions; graphic, typographical, and visual elements, etc. I show that due to the expectations of the addressees regarding the reconstructed genres and the addressing parties, genre shifts may serve to fulfill two main pragmatic-rhetorical functions: (1) Promoting messages regarding the desired conduct of the voters during the elections; (2) Self-positioning of the parties, either to strengthen their existing image among the public or to create a new, surprising one. I thus emphasize the key role played by genre shifts in the intertextual phenomenon of integrating semiotic meanings into a linguistic text; specifically in this case, integrating cultural-societal meanings into campaign advertisements.

A quantitative content analysis of 1,357 news articles in The Star and Malaysiakini was conducted along with lexical analyses using a textual analytics software known as AntConc. The results indicate that 1MDB was more salient in Malaysiakini before the change of government but its salience was elevated in The Star during the new Pakatan Harapan regime. Both newspapers were oriented towards episodic framing, but in the new regime, The Star's percentage of episodic articles increased while that of Malaysiakini decreased. The low percentage of thematic articles (less than 11%) indicate that the media framing of 1MDB could have made readers oblivious to the ramifying impacts of 1MDB on Malaysia and its citizens. The Star tended to quote ruling party politicians and adopted a formal stance in reporting 1MDB-linked events whereas Malaysiakini used more varied news sources and a personalised stance to engage readers. Before the change of government, The Star had a balance of positive, negative and neutral 1MDB-related articles but Malaysiakini articles were inclined towards a negative valence. During the Pakatan Harapan regime, both newspapers adopted a positive stance in reporting on 1MDB, focusing on actions to resolve the financial scandal. The textual frequency analysis reveals an obvious lack of negative adjectives, indicating an avoidance of evaluative judgements on a financial scandal involving high-ranking political figures.

J	CHILTON, P				CHILTON, P			THE WOUND WE HAVE TO CLOSE... - METAPHORS IN RACIST DISCOURSE	JOURNAL OF PRAGMATICS			French	Article; Proceedings Paper	Colloquium on Identities and Otherness	NOV, 1991	RABAT, MOROCCO					This article applies a methodology derived from cognitive semantics, in particular from the theorY of metaphor, in order to analyse (1) the lexical structures of racist discourse, and (2) their realization in a sample of French texts representing the spectrum of political parties in the 1980s. The principal structures rest on the cognitive schema of closed space (container) and on the cognitive schema of physical movement ('path'). From these two schemas emerge, on the one hand, notions of externality, otherness, difference, etc., and on the other hand notions of exclusion, penetration, assimilation, etc. - notions often linked to a certain conception of the human body. The putting into discourse of these lexical networks contributes to the internal coherence of texts dealing with migration, as well as to the intertextual coherence observable across the domain of public expression. The difference between the political parties in relation to the question of migration seems to lie less in the store of basic concepts than in the degree of explicitness that their texts display. On the basis of the linguistic and textual analyses the article offers, by way of conclusion, five hypotheses on the nature of racist discourse in general and on its relationship to the political evolution of Europe.

VALUE DOMINANTS OF BASQUE MENTALITY IN THE CONTEMPORARY MEDIA IN SPAIN	THEORETICAL AND PRACTICAL ISSUES OF JOURNALISM			Russian	Article						Basque language; language contacts; onomastics; intercultural contacts; mass media space; political discourse		The article discusses and interprets the Basque mentality values and their evidence in the contemporary political discourse and media. An important task of communication science and medialinguistics is the study of pragma-linguistic properties of media texts and their impact on the audience. The contemporary Spanish media feature an impressive range of sources representing and interpreting the multicultural and multi-ethnic situation in Spain, as well as ongoing socio-political and socio-economic changes. Together with the Spanish language being the official state language, the Catalan, the Galician and the Basque have been established co-official languages by the Spanish Constitution. Basque Autonomous Community, or the Basque Country, is one of the most prosperous and steadily developing Autonomous Communities of Spain, which affects the socio-political situation in the region and the discourse of political parties. A vast majority of Basque people are bilingual. The hypothesis of this study states that the contemporary reality of the Basque Country finds its reflection in value dominants of the discourse of political parties of the Basque Country. This discourse is objectified by the Mass Media rhetoric, studying which the authors determine and discuss the value dominants of Basque linguistic culture, their linguo-pragmatic features and their use in the media language, as well as their lexical, semantic, morphological and syntactic features. All this builds up the topicality of the research into pragma-linguistic parameters of media texts and mechanisms of their impact on the audience. The authors infer that the media rhetoric includes onomastic dominants (naming units of Spanish Basque Country and French Basque Country and their paraphrases, of Spain, Basque people, and the Basque language), and keywords of the Basque mentality introduced into a Spanish text in Basque. Moreover, being integral components of the discourse of political parties in the Basque Country, these linguistic means acquire and realize their cultural and symbolic potential, and reflect the mentality, values, and traditions of Basques in the modern Basque and Spanish media.

During the same time Twitter has become an indispensable communication tool for politicians. To explore this link, we examine what usage patterns reveal about users' opinions on the issue of Brexit, these usage patterns consisting of tweet frequency and length, as well as the terms used and their length. We analyse 185,970 tweets from 576 twitter accounts, each account associated with a Member of the British Parliament (MP). We use regression analysis and sentiment analysis, namely Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF), to investigate if there is a relationship between the features of text data and the characteristics of Twitter users. Whereas these methods have previously been applied to American two-party politics, the multiple parties of the British political landscape have led to previous studies using typological analysis (human classifiers) to identify tweets. We present a methodology that assigns a political value based on an MP's voting record on a single issue (Brexit). We identify systematic yet subtle differences in the way the two sides of the debate use language, but also specific usage patterns that are common to both. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

The main difference these texts have with news articles is that their target is apparently defined and unique across the text. Thence while dealing with news articles, we performed three subtasks namely identifying the target; separation of good and bad news content from the good and bad sentiment expressed on the target and analysis of clearly marked opinion that is expressed explicitly, not needing interpretation or the use of world knowledge. On concluding these tasks, we present our work on mining opinions about three different Indian political parties during elections in the year 2009. We built a Corpus of 689 opinion-rich instances from three different English dailies namely The Hindu, Times of India and Economic Times extracted from 02/01/2009 to 05/01/2009 (MM/DD/YY). In which (a) we tested the relative suitability of various sentiment analysis methods (both machine learning and lexical based) and (b) we attempted to separate positive or negative opinion from good or bad news. Evaluation includes comparison of three sentiment analysis methods (two machine learning based and one lexical based) and analyzing the choice of certain words used in political text which influence the Sentiments of public in polls. This preliminary experiment will benefit in predicting and forecasting the winning party in forthcoming Indian elections 2014.	[Padmaja, S.; Fatima, S. Sameen; Kosala, Pooja; Abhignya, M.

J	Luchkanyn, S				Luchkanyn, Serhii			Displaying of Ideological Dogmas Textbooks on Romanian, Published in the USSR between 1930-1989	PHILOLOGICA JASSYENSIA			Unspecified	Article						ideologization; marxism-leninism; Romanian; USSR; Romanian People's Republic; Socialist Republic of Romania		The article deals with the content of texts and examples to Romanian grammar's rules, which are available in Romanian language textbooks (partly in bilingual Russian-Romanian dictionaries, Russian-Romanian phrasebook) published in the former Soviet Union between 1930-1989. It is proved that they are all filled with the dominant Soviet Communist ideology, which has its shades depending on the year of the emergence of academic publications. In the first Russian textbook of Romanian language written by Lev Spanier and Heinz Kagan (1930) there are such examples of illustrative material to the rules of Romanian grammar: Friedrich Engels was a great man, our goal is world revolution, the Red Army does not drink alcohol, class consciousness should be in every proletarian and etc., which vividly reflect the dominant ideology of world revolution in the 1920s in the USSR. There are samples of Romanian military equipment and aircraft in Russian-Romanian phrasebook, which was published in spring 1941. Russian-Romanian dictionary of 1953 bears the imprint of late Stalinism with such examples: master the fundamentals of Marxism-Leninism, the party is the highest form of the proletarian class organization, Leninism is Marxism of the era of imperialism and the proletarian revolution, Lenin-Stalin's party and etc. In the first edition of Romanian language textbook written by Aida Samoilivna Sadecka (1962) we find cliches of Nikita Khrushchev's times Soviet propaganda in the spirit of full development of communism, space exploration, which was current at the time: the 7th of November in Moscow, a kolkhoz "Red October (Chervonyj zhovten)", the Soviet Union on the way of building communism, the first cosmonaut is communist, major Herman Stepanovich Titov's long-term Space flight was successfully completed, Everything is for people, everything is for the good of people (the report about the "historic" decision of the XXII Congress of the CPRS, instead, nothing is said about the extension of exposure of the cult of Stalin by Nikita Khrushchev at the Congress, because the Romanian party leader, Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej rejected the politic of de-Stalinization). In the second edition of this textbook (1974), along with traditional texts, there appear the term developed socialist society; much more attention is given to Lenin in texts, but the texts about the exploration of space are removed. Romanian Grammar reference written by Tamara Repina (Moscow, 1968) and a textbook on Romanian commercial language written by Petrunkina G. (1977) are less ideological, although there are such examples as the struggle for peace, the XX Congress of the CPRS and the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance, which included Socialist Republic of Romania. Finally, in the two volumes of the Romanian language textbook written by Jurij Zajunchkovskij, Tamara Repina and Tatiana Nicolescu (Moscow, 1982. 1989) there are such late-Soviet ideological clichs as: "Pravda" newspaper, "Iskra" newspaper, the Communist party is the vanguard of a socialist society, the Soviet-Romanian friendship, welcome to the USSR, the Soviet Union in the vanguard of progress, the arms race, the struggle for peace, nuclear free zone, discharge. Examples of Romanian classical literature of the 19th century and the Romanian fine literature of the 20th century are selected in the spirit of "socialist realism".

Fast Privacy-Preserving Text Classification Based on Secure Multiparty Computation	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION FORENSICS AND SECURITY			English	Article						Privacy-preserving classification; secure multiparty computation; Naive Bayes; spam		We propose a privacy-preserving Naive Bayes classifier and apply it to the problem of private text classification. In this setting, a party (Alice) holds a text message, while another party (Bob) holds a classifier. At the end of the protocol, Alice will only learn the result of the classifier applied to her text input and Bob learns nothing. Our solution is based on Secure Multiparty Computation (SMC). Our Rust implementation provides a fast and secure solution for the classification of unstructured text. Applying our solution to the case of spam detection (the solution is generic, and can be used in any other scenario in which the Naive Bayes classifier can be employed), we can classify an SMS as spam or ham in less than 340ms in the case where the dictionary size of Bob's model includes all words (n = 5200) and Alice's SMS has at most m = 160 unigrams. In the case with n = 369 and m = 8 (the average of a spam SMS in the database), our solution takes only 21 ms.

We find (a) that Mitt Romney was an unconventional Republican in 2012 (but not in 2008); (b) that Romney employed both "Republican" and "Democratic" language and did so to good effect (both in the primaries and in the general election); (c) that Barack Obama matched Romney in these ways, departing sharply from his own 2008 campaign style; and (d) that the candidates increasingly resembled one another as election day approached. We conclude that, no matter what their party of origin, all national politicians must be versed in the Democratic/Republican lexicon, a requirement that distinguishes the American political ethos.

J	Stumpf, S				Stumpf, Soeren			The Wahl-O-Mat from a Politolinguistic Perspective	SPRACHWISSENSCHAFT			German	Article							COMMUNICATION	The German voting advice application Wahl-O-Mat has become a permanent institution in times of state, federal and European elections. Millions of Germans use the Wahl-O-Mat to determine the extent to which their individual views on fundamental and current political issues coincide with the positions of the respective parties. Despite its importance as an instrument for political opinion-forming, no research on the Wahl-O-Mat has been conducted within political linguistics so far. Therefore, this paper aims at making the Wahl-O-Mat fruitful for linguistic research. Based on case studies, the potential of the Wahl-O-Mat for political linguistics is elaborated. The focus is laid on text-linguistic, lexical and argumentative perspectives.										59	0	0	0	0	UNIVERSITATSVERLAG C WINTER HEIDELBERG GMBH	HEIDELBERG	POSTFACH 10 61 40, D-69051 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY	0344-8169	2567-6563		SPRACHWISSENSCHAFT	Sprachwissenschaft		2021	46	3					315	341					27	Language & Linguistics	Arts &amp; Humanities Citation Index (A&amp;HCI)	Linguistics	YE6US	WOS:000741258700002					2022-03-30

However, apart from English language resources, validated dictionaries are rare. This note introduces a German sentiment dictionary and assesses its performance against human intuition in parliamentary speeches, party manifestos, and media coverage. The tool published with this note is indeed able to discriminate positive and negative political language. But the validation exercises indicate that positive language is easier to detect than negative language, while the scores are numerically biased to zero. This warrants caution when interpreting sentiment scores as interval or even ratio scales in applied research.

This study will be conducted for the early recognition of sources of uncertainty in construction contracts that are crucial to avoid when meeting the project objectives. To achieve this goal, a two-stage approach will be used. First, a text analysis method will be developed following previous research to identify key commitments. This rule-based method will rely on a lexicon database that includes promisor-determiner nouns (PDN) and obligation-maker verbs (OMV). Second, to estimate the effects of uncertainties on project objectives, a two-stage risk analysis technique based upon probability and impact estimation will be adapted. The proposed text analysis framework will be validated using MATLAB. The major contribution of knowledge from this study will be to present a text mining risk analysis-based model to assess the patterns of the risk-sharing under general conditions of contract between parties. To quantify the risks of contract obligations, the clauses of general conditions of the New South Wales Government of Australia GC21 (NSW GC21) contract will be analyzed against five project objectives. The results show that the proposed method could be effectively used to identify the main obligations of the other party in the types of contracts to develop the contract strategy for the client and the contractor.

J	Shukrun-Nagar, P				Shukrun-Nagar, Pnina			Quotation markers as intertextual codes in electoral propaganda	TEXT & TALK			English	Article						intertextuality; electoral campaign; propaganda; covert persuasion; quotation markers		This article explores the intertextual nature (as defined by Kristeva) of linguistic markers used to denote quotations (quotation markers) in the 1999 Israeli televised electoral campaign. Three kinds of quotation markers were identified: source markers (references, qualifiers), describing the source,speech markers (lexical, graphical), attesting to speech production; and circumstance markers, describing the context (time, place, participants, background) in which the quotation was produced. It was found that, it? addition to their overt role as references to the quotation, quotation markers also encode the ideological and argumentative value attributed by the parties to the quotations and their sources. Source markers serve to affiliate the sources with the positively regarded "we" group, to exclude them, or to establish them as neutral; speech and circumstance markers serve to affiliate quotations with the positively regarded ideological text of the party, to exclude them, or to mark them as neutral. Moreover, these three markers serve to reinforce the reliability of quotations that fulfill a corroborative role. These values are encoded by the mere presence of the markers, as well as by such devices as variation in the frequency of the markers, their content, emotive connotations, grammatical forms, and incorporation in recurring patterns.

It provides a qualitative account of a selection of posters within the framework of Discourse Viewpoint Space (Dancygier and Vandelanotte 2016), specifically exploring discourse viewpoint configurations in the posters with a special focus on their texts (e.g., lexical choices and style), visual images, and the viewpoints of different participants (i.e., current speaker/addressee and represented speaker/addressee). We collected 87 posters from the Advertising Archives (http://www.advertisingarchives.co.uk) in August 2018. We categorized the selected posters into three types: (1) those explicitly encoding the speaker, (2) those explicitly encoding the addressee, and (3) those explicitly encoding both. We take a detailed look at each type, focusing on whether the viewpoint of the current interlocutor is aligned with that of the represented interlocutor, assuming that the current speaker is equivalent to those who design the posters, and the current addressee to those who view the posters. Based on this inductive functional taxonomy, this paper discusses how the multimodal posters political messages are constructed and construed in terms of the levels of hierarchical viewpoint networks, which include local perspectives and more comprehensive discourse viewpoints, as well as viewpoint alignment between the participants. The study shows that the viewpoint configurations of the posters are key to the articulation of the intended messages such that they fit the values of the two political parties. The study also supports the claim that multiple viewpoints are intrinsic to meaning construction, and to the conceptualization of multimodal expressions (Sweetser 2012).

By analyzing a data set made of public speeches, interviews, and statements from Trump's official website, the paper will look at how certain lexico-grammatical and intertextual choices in Trump's representation of immigration display all the typical features of a populist agenda. Trump's texts will be analyzed according to Wodak's Discourse-Historical approach: Trump's own "politics of fear" and language on immigration are evidence of the strong currency held by values associated with right-wing, ethno-nationalist populism, once the core ideological tenets only of certain fringe movements such as the Tea Party, but now firmly established in mainstream politics.

J	Mouritsen, SC				Mouritsen, Stephen C.			CONTRACT INTERPRETATION WITH CORPUS LINGUISTICS	WASHINGTON LAW REVIEW			English	Article							CHEVRON; LIMITS; LAW	Courts and scholars disagree about the quantum of evidence that is necessary to determine the meaning of contractual provisions. Formalists favor excluding extrinsic evidence unless the contractual text is found to be ambiguous. Contextualists, by contrast, look to extrinsic evidence to support claims about contractual meaning even absent a finding of ambiguity. The formalist approach is faulted for failing to provide a meaningful account of the parties' intentions and for placing heavy reliance upon the judge's own linguistic intuitions and general-use English dictionaries-both problematic guides to plain meaning. At the same time, the contextualist approach may impose significant costs on the contracting parties and invite strategic behavior. Corpus linguistics offers a middle way. Corpus linguistics draws on evidence of language use from large, coded, electronic collections of natural language-language used in natural settings, rather than language elicited through interviews or surveys. These may include collections of texts from newspapers, magazines, academic articles, or transcribed conversations. These collections of texts are referred to as corpora (the plural of corpus). Linguistic corpora can be designed to model the linguistic conventions of a wide variety of speech communities, industries, or linguistic registers. Because large, sophisticated linguistic corpora are freely available, language evidence from linguistic corpora offers a comparatively low-cost alternative to the vast quantity of extrinsic evidence permitted by contextualist interpretive approaches. Moreover, by evaluating corpus evidence, judges and lawyers can create a more accurate, evidence-based picture of contractual meaning than can be found in the formalist judge's linguistic intuition or in a general-use dictionary. Moreover, corpora can provide objective evidence of the linguistic conventions of the communities that draft and are governed by the agreements judges and lawyers are called upon to interpret. Corpus evidence can give content to otherwise vague legal concepts and provide linguistic evidence to aid in the evaluation of claims about the meaning (or ambiguity) of a contractual text.

So, this became a cakewalk to know the opinion of people. It has demonstrated, apart from social media uses, that it plays a crucial role in analyzing the trends in elections on the contrary to the biased predictions belong to the same region, community, class, and religion with the help of sentimental Analysis. Sentimental Analysis refers to identifying and categorizing opinions, especially in terms of positive, negative, neutral. In this paper, we study the trends of Andhra Pradesh Election 2019 using websites like Quora and Twitter by using Lexicon based approach and calculating the polarity score. The experimental results infer that Quora can also be used to obtain the behavior of different political parties.

J	Glogarova, JD; Kubat, M				Glogarova, Jana Davidova; Kubat, Miroslav			A comparative frequency analysis of the exile speeches of Klement Gottwald and Edvard Benes, 1939-1945	SLOVO A SLOVESNOST			Czech	Article						Benes; Gottwald; political speech; corpus; frequency analysis; lexical statistics; radio		The aim of this study is to compare the speeches of two important Czechoslovak politicians - Edvard Benes and Klement Gottwald. Thematic words (TW) and keywords (KW) of their speeches broadcasted on radio during World War II (1939-1945) are analysed. Although these methods are related, each of them provides different perspectives on the issue. Thematic words are based on the frequency distribution of the analysed text itself, whereas keywords are generated through the comparison of two corpora (namely Benes versus Gottwald). Since Czech is a highly inflective language, all texts are lemmatized. Benes led the Czechoslovak government-in-exile in London from 1939 to 1945. Gottwald, as the leader of the Communist Party, emigrated to Moscow in 1938. The results show that their differing political orientations, enhanced by their time in exile, influenced the language of their speeches. Benes emphasized democratic principles, while Gottwald promoted communist revolutionary ideas. Gottwald's speeches were also considerably more offensive and direct. The results also show that both politicians emphasized the importance of the Soviet Union in World War II, whereas only Benes mentioned the United Kingdom.

Framing the Bicyclist: A Qualitative Study of Media Discourse about Fatal Bicycle Crashes	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article								This research examines the linguistic choices that frame relationships between bicyclists and other parties involved in fatal crash events. Textual data were collected from media reports of all bicyclist traffic fatalities that occurred from January 2009 through June 2018 in Hillsborough County, Florida, which has a disproportionately high number of bicyclist deaths compared with other areas of the U.S. The media reports were coded with a qualitative data analysis software and analyzed using critical discourse analysis (CDA), a rigorous qualitative method used to analyze oral and written communication developed by Fairclough. Through CDA, the study examines how linguistic choices produce meaning and reinforce the "common sense'' or "taken-for-granted'' lexicon of transportation. Results show the majority of news reports were episodic rather than thematic, focusing on the traffic event and the parties involved in the crash, particularly the bicyclist. Vocabulary, grammatical structure, and narrative framing of news reports largely functioned to remove blame from the motorist and to highlight the bicyclist's actions. These linguistic strategies reflect the assumption that responsibility for safety rests on the bicyclist and detracts attention from potential social policy reform that would lead to fewer bicyclist fatalities. A minority of articles written with thematic frames focused on broader issues such as social capital, safety education, and advocacy. This interdisciplinary study is a unique contribution to transportation literature, employing a methodology typically reserved for communication scholars and linguists.

Fightin' Words: Lexical Feature Selection and Evaluation for Identifying the Content of Political Conflict	POLITICAL ANALYSIS			English	Article							GENE SELECTION; POSITIONS; ABORTION; ISSUE	Entries in the burgeoning "text-as-data" movement are often accompanied by lists or visualizations of how word (or other lexical feature) usage differs across some pair or set of documents. These are intended either to establish some target semantic concept (like the content of partisan frames) to estimate word-specific measures that feed forward into another analysis (like locating parties in ideological space) or both. We discuss a variety of techniques for selecting words that capture partisan, or other, differences in political speech and for evaluating the relative importance of those words. We introduce and emphasize several new approaches based on Bayesian shrinkage and regularization. We illustrate the relative utility of these approaches with analyses of partisan, gender, and distributive speech in the U.S. Senate.

By following the model developed by Gallardo Pauls (2014; 2021 in press), which examines pragmatic categories according to their textual, interactive and enunciative levels, we have identified discursive framing strategies that cognitively guide the headlines of all the newspapers in our corpus. Even though representative illocution was the most frequently used strategy in the texts compiled, a detailed analysis reveals that some of the media (e.g. ABC, La Vanguardia, El Pais and El Diario) used a evident lexical strategy (for example, the use of metaphors, metonyms, nominalisations with ironic value, etc.), which was able to elicit pre-activations contrary to this political party.

In this paper the application of cognitive linguistics and mass communication theories are combined in order to analyze a corpus of news headlines, with a model of discourse analysis focused on five linguistic framing strategies. The strategies are: intentional (speech act), lexical (marked uses of denomination), predicative (application of syntactic iconicity in expressive acts), textual (use of narrative or argumentative superstructure) and interactive (dialogism and intertextuality). The use of these strategies in journalistic news is bound with mediatization proceses, that turn the discourse of political communication (institutional or partisan) in an embedded, recursive enunciation. It is found that this conversion requires a readjustment of these strategies with reference to how are they used in the discourse of political parties and politicians.

Current segmentation methods are well suited for written and structured texts making use of their distinctive macro-level structures. Text segmentation of transcribed multi-party conversation presents a different challenge given the lack of linguistic features such as headings, paragraph, and well formed sentences. This paper describes an algorithm suited for transcribed meeting conversations combining semantically complex lexical relations with conversational cue phrases to build lexical chains in determining topic boundaries.

This Comment documents how judges employ sentence diagrams in constitutional, statutory, and contract cases. It finds that diagramming plays an important role in constitutional and statutory cases, complementing traditional canons of legal interpretation, but that diagramming is less often used in contract cases for fear of disadvantaging grammatically unsophisticated parties. In addition, this Comment defends the practice of judicial diagramming as a way of improving textualist interpretation and promoting broader values of judicial opinion writing.

Two case studies comparing how the People's Daily and Central Daily News reported the civil unrest in South Africa (22-8 March 1985) and in Argentina (31 May-1 June 1989) are presented, critically analysing how various textual elements might be employed for justificatory purposes - in this case, the justification and legitimization of certain foreign policies adopted by the regimes in China and Taiwan. The article investigates how discourse features, such as lexical choices, grammatical elements, headlines and thematic structures, may be varied or manipulated in the construction of a version of political reality written for the two different readerships.

Such semantically plausible combinations of two content words, which we hereafter refer to as collocations, are important knowledge in many areas of computational linguistics. We present the structure of a lexical resource that provides such knowledge-a collocation database (CBD). Since such databases cannot be complete under any reasonable compilation procedure, we consider heuristic-based inference mechanisms that predict new plausible collocations based on the ones present in the CDB, with the help of a WordNet-like thesaurus: if an available collocation combines the entries A and B, and B is 'similar' to C, then A and C are supposed to constitute a collocation of the same category. Also, we describe the semantically induced morphological categories suiting for such inference, as well as the heuristics for filtering out wrong hypotheses. We discuss the experience in inferences obtained with CrossLexica CDB.

Unfortunately, tools currently available for automated sentiment analysis are mostly restricted to English texts and require considerable contextual adaption to produce valid results. We present a procedure for collecting fine-grained sentiment scores through crowdcoding to build a negative sentiment dictionary in a language and for a domain of choice. The dictionary enables the analysis of large text corpora that resource-intensive hand-coding struggles to cope with. We calculate the tonality of sentences from dictionary words and we validate these estimates with results from manual coding. The results show that the crowdbased dictionary provides efficient and valid measurement of sentiment. Empirical examples illustrate its use by analyzing the tonality of party statements and media reports.

Such semantically plausible combinations of two content words, which we hereafter refer to as collocations, are important knowledge in many areas of computational linguistics. We consider a lexical resource that provides such knowledge-a collocation database (CBD). Since such databases cannot be complete under any reasonable compilation procedure, we consider heuristic-based inference mechanisms that predict new plausible collocations based on the ones present in the CDB, with the help of a WordNet-like thesaurus. If an available collocation combines the entries A and B, and B is 'similar' to C, then A and C supposedly constitute a collocation of the same category. Also, we touch upon semantically induced morphological categories suiting for such inferences. Several heuristics for filtering out wrong hypotheses are also given and the experience in inferences obtained with CrossLexica CDB is briefly discussed.

APHORISMS WITH THE MEANING OF FUTURE IN POLITICAL DISCOURSE IN LANGUAGES OF DIFFERENT STRUCTURE	VESTNIK ROSSIISKOGO UNIVERSITETA DRUZHBY NARODOV-SERIYA LINGVISTIKA-RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF LINGUISTICS			Russian	Article						aphorism; political discourse; future; concept "power"; concept "politician"; mass media		The article is devoted to the study of the category of future in French, Russian, Tatar and Mari aphorisms. The data were taken from international and regional mass media. We compared proverbs, sayings, appeals, mottoes, slogans, cliches, symbol phrases, and quotations. The special attention was paid to functioning of aphorisms expressing the concepts "power" and "politician". The conducted analysis showed that the most frequent aphorisms in mass media of the languages under the study relate to the following lexico-semantic fields: foreign/domestic policy, state/country, state structures / services, establishments, governing bodies, political system, authorities, heads of political structures, parties, movements, and their members. The analyzed languages aphorisms are based on precedent texts and intertextuality. The use of internal resources of language prevails in the Russian, French and Tatar political discourses while the regional languages tend to calque aphorisms from Russian and have a relatively small number of occasional aphorisms. Besides the grammar means of expression of future, which is typical of all the languages analyzed, Russian, Tatar, and French contain lexical and grammatical means. The Russian language demonstrates semantic transformation in political aphorisms expressing the future. The article revealed the predominance of aphorisms in political discourse relating to the core area of functional semantic field of futurity, over the periphery and border zone. The results of the study show that aphorisms with the meaning of future are more typical of the Russian political discourse in comparison with the French, Tatar and Mari political discourses.

The amount of research work on sentiment analysis is growing explosively. However, the majority of research efforts are devoted to English language data, while a great share of information is available in other languages. It is a challenging task to identify sentiment polarity of reviews written in both Wolof and French languages because theirs spelling are usually incorrect or non-uniform. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that contains (i) an extended French lexicon [1] with a new words and expressions currently used in both languages; and (ii) a sentiment scoring algorithm that uses string (word) similarity algorithm to address the spelling problem. Our algorithm classifies reviews as positive or negative based on the polarity of the words or expressions. Our experimental results on a real corpus demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposal.

This policy must be written in an understandable language that both contracting parties may understand. This necessarily implies a suitable translation, which requires the translator to know both the textual conventions and the theoretical structure of the genre. In this paper, we present the results of a descriptive-comparative analysis of several French and Spanish car insurance policies. Our main objective is to provide scholars and professional translators with the knowledge of the genre conventions that govern this type of policies as well as its language peculiarities. The obtained findings show the differences and commonalties found in general and in particular conditions, modalities and services provided as well as relevant morphosyntactic and lexical characteristics of these textual documents in both languages. A significant selection of examples taken from French and Spanish texts supports our study.

Contesting meanings in the speeches of national leaders in Taiwan during the authoritarian period	JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE AND POLITICS			English	Article						first-person plural pronoun; Taiwan; national leaders' speeches	STRATEGIC USE; FORMS	This paper analyzes how political aspirations and convictions during Taiwan's authoritarian period (from the 1940s to 1996) are expressed through first-person plural pronouns. Combining both corpus-assisted method and discourse historical analysis (DHA, Wodak et al. 1999), we compared the speeches delivered by the presidents - Chiang Kai-shek (CKS, 1955-1975), Chiang Ching-kuo (CCK, 1978-1988), and Lee Teng-hui (LTH, 1989-1996) - from the one-party domination era to the time of the direct presidential elections in 1996. Moreover, by locating lexical items in the co-texts and checking the collocates, we have tried to find referents of we against changing socio-political contexts. The meaning of we has changed from representing Chinese compatriots on the Chinese mainland and the revolutionary militia in CKS's speeches to an over-inclusion and more hearer-dominant (HD) we in CCK's speeches. A "wandering we" was found in LTH's speeches with which a well-defined national collectivity was difficult to identify in the late 1980s.

J	Lipshaw, JM				Lipshaw, Jeffrey M.			LEXICAL OPPORTUNISM AND THE LIMITS OF CONTRACT THEORY	UNIVERSITY OF CINCINNATI LAW REVIEW			English	Article							LAW	This essay is a reflection on the gap between the real-life practice of contract law and some of the academic theory that tries to explain it. I describe "lexical opportunism," an aspect of contract practice having three elements. First, the parties must have reduced a complex business arrangement to contractual text, portions of which text are as devoid of thoughtful drafting or close negotiation as the boilerplate in a consumer contract. Second, an adversary cleverly develops a legal theory based upon a colorable interpretation of that text. Third, this interpretation creates a potential for staggering liability beyond all common sense. A multi-billion lawsuit, recently settled, serves as an example, and triggers my discussion of (a) what it means to engage in theoretical assessment in contract law; (b) how the justification of contract law by way of inhibiting economic opportunism is based on the simplest examples, rather than the kind of contract discourse found in any real-world contract worth spending millions to litigate; and (c) how normative theory based on upholding the moral sanctity of promise keeping evaporates when the parties disagree about the meaning of their promises. I argue that both economic and moral theories about contract law fail to account for issues in the use of language and depend on the naive adoption of the correspondence theory of truth. The nature of language permits opportunism, and the only check on it is the desire, from whatever motivation, not to be opportunistic. I conclude with what I hope are some constructive thoughts about the appropriate use of theory in lawyering, and thereby mitigate my skepticism whether any single theory or discipline is capable of meaningful explanation or prediction about lexical opportunism. "We should be pragmatic about theory It is a tool, rather than a glimpse of ultimate truth, and the criterion of a tool is its utility."

J	Bogdanchikov, SA				Bogdanchikov, SA			On the subject of the term "Soviet psychology"	VOPROSY PSIKHOLOGII			Russian	Article								Analysis of modern-day Russian psychological dictionaries, textbooks and course-books on the history of psychology shows that none contains a definition of the notion "Soviet psychology". Research of original publications has revealed that Soviet psychology used to be treated as a "special" science including a number of additional characteristics besides the proper scientific content. According to that intcrpretation, Soviet psychology is not just "psychology in the USSR", but a science which is Marxist in its ideological foundation; ideological (representing ideology of a certain party) in its goals, objectives and functional mechanisms; whole in its structure, militant and advanced with respect to world psychology. Understanding of Soviet psychology as a special science is essential for objective analysis of history and ideological and theoretical legacy of the national psychology of the Soviet period.										34	3	3	1	1	MEZHDUNARODNAYA KNIGA	MOSCOW	39 DIMITROVA UL., 113095 MOSCOW, RUSSIA	0042-8841			VOP PSIKHOL+	Vopr.

Prediction of Election Result by Enhanced Sentiment Analysis on Twitter Data using Word Sense Disambiguation	2015 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON CONTROL COMMUNICATION & COMPUTING INDIA (ICCC)			English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Control Communication & Computing India (ICCC)	NOV 19-21, 2015	Trivandrum, INDIA			Negation Handling; Sentiment Analysis; WordNet; SentiWordNet; Word Sense Disambiguation		Sentiment analysis is the computational study of opinions, sentiments, evaluations, attitudes, views and emotions expressed in text. It refers to a classification problem where the main focus is to predict the polarity of words and then classify them into positive or negative sentiment. Sentiment analysis over Twitter offers people a fast and effective way to measure the public's feelings towards their party and politicians. The primary issues in previous sentiment analysis techniques are classification accuracy, as they incorrectly classify most of the tweets with the biasing towards the training data. In opinion texts, lexical content alone also can be misleading. Therefore, here we adopt a lexicon based sentiment analysis method, which will exploit the sense definitions, as semantic indicators of sentiment. Here we propose a novel approach for accurate sentiment classification of twitter messages using lexical resources SentiWordNet and WordNet along with Word Sense Disambiguation. Thus we applied the SentiWordNet lexical resource and Word Sense Disambiguation for finding political sentiment from real time tweets. Our method also uses a negation handling as a pre-processing step in order to achieve high accuracy.

We apply these approaches on the discussion topics contained in a corpus of American Congressional speech data. We propose three approaches to classifying opinion at the speech segment level, firstly using similarity measures to the affect, opinion and attitude lexicon, secondly dependency analysis and thirdly SVM machine learning. Further, we study the impact of taking into consideration the Source of opinion and the consistency in the opinion expressed, and propose three methods to classify opinion at the speaker intervention level, showing improvements over the classification of individual text segments. Finally, we propose a method to identify the party the opinion belongs to, through the identification of specific affective and non-affective lexicon used in the argumentations. We present the results obtained when evaluating the different methods we developed, together with a discussion on the issues encountered and some possible solutions. We conclude that, even at a more general level, our approach performs better than trained classifiers on specific data.

J	Lee, JS				Lee, Jamie Shinhee			Sports, Instagram, and conflict talk in Englishes	WORLD ENGLISHES			English	Article							ONLINE; FANS; US	This study examines conflict talk and 'othering discourse' on Instagram involving the 2018 Winter Olympics hosted in Pyeongchang, South Korea. The disqualification of highly anticipated medalists in short track speed skating events elicited heated online arguments between Korean and Chinese sports fans. A content analysis of antagonistic texts featuring anti-Korea and anti-China posts reveals that 'othering' practices are predominantly performed by: (1) making reference to seemingly irrelevant details; (2) evoking stereotypical images of a race and/or a nation; and (3) utilizing overtly offensive language or transgressive language. Drawing upon linguistic strategies of encoding 'us' vs. 'them' dichotomies reported in earlier research, this study shows that explicit disparagement, disapproving representation of the other, stereotyping, and overgeneralization are readily utilized by both parties, who also occasionally engage in verbal reconciliation through lexical and syntactic mirroring.

Ideological Scaling of Social Media Users: A Dynamic Lexicon Approach	POLITICAL ANALYSIS			English	Article						automated content analysis; computational social science; ideal point estimation; ideological scaling; machine learning; social media		Words matter in politics. The rhetoric that political elites employ structures civic discourse. The emergence of social media platforms as a medium of politics has enabled ordinary citizens to express their ideological inclinations by adopting the lexicon of political elites. This avails to researchers a rich new source of data in the study of political ideology. However, existing ideological text-scaling methods fail to produce meaningful inferences when applied to the short, informal style of textual content that is characteristic of social media platforms such as Twitter. This paper introduces the first viable approach to the estimation of individual-level ideological positions derived from social media content. This method allows us to position social media users-be they political elites, parties, or citizens-along a shared ideological dimension. We validate the proposed method by demonstrating correlation with existing measures of ideology across various political contexts and multiple languages. We further demonstrate the ability of ideological estimates to capture derivative signal by predicting out-of-sample, individual-level voting intentions. We posit that social media data can, when properly modeled, better capture derivative signal than discrete scales used in more traditional survey instruments.

However, a broad use of Web Services requires efficient approaches to allow service consumption from within applications. Currently, developers are compelled to search for suitable services mainly by manually exploring Web catalogs, which usually show poorly relevant information, than to provide the adequate "glue-code" for their assembly. This implies a large effort into discovering, selecting and adapting services. To overcome these challenges, this paper presents a novel Web Service Selection Method. We have defined an Interface Compatibility procedure to assess structural-semantic aspects from functional specifications - in the form of WSDL documents - of candidate Web Services. Two different semantic basis have been used to define and implement the approach: WordNet, a widely known lexical dictionary of the English language; and DISCO, a database which indexes co-occurrences of terms in very large text collections.

C	Alperin, BJ			VALUATION; VALUATION	Alperin, BJ			Verifying damaged property transactions	VALUATION 2000: PAPERS AND PROCEEDINGS			English	Proceedings Paper	Valuation 2000 Conference	2000	LAS VEGAS, NV	Amer Soc Appraisers, Amer Soc Farm Managers & Rural Appraisers, Appraisal Inst				The quality and effectiveness of every appraisal depend on the availability and accuracy of data. Verification is a key function in the appraisal process. Although the term verification is used in law and almost every text on valuation, the appraisal profession has not adopted a specific definition of the verification process. Key terms such as verify, confirm, party to the transaction, and principal to the transaction are not defined in USPAP, codes of ethics, dictionaries, or textbooks. It is time for the appraisal profession to codify these terms and acknowledge a formal verification process. This paper presents a 14-step process for data verification and appropriate interviewing techniques. The verification process involves more than just a series of questions. Verification, like appraisal, is a blend of art and science. The interview process, techniques, and sample questions are discussed. Interview techniques are applicable to all disciplines and types of assignments.										0	0	0	0	1	APPRAISAL INSTITUTE	CHICAGO	875 MICHIGAN AVE, SUITE 2400, CHICAGO, IL 60611-1980 USA			0-922154-60-0				2000							135	143					9	Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary	Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science &amp; Humanities (CPCI-SSH)	Social Sciences - Other Topics	BS16K	WOS:000168893700011					2022-03-30

The research has been aimed at identifying the most relevant vocables in the legal field and the use of archaic lexicon, to understand their meaning in the procedural context. Manuscript texts, despite the difficulties of the cursive Gothic letter, are an essential source for finding out the usage and writing of the Catalan lexicon. Once the vocables are identified, an etymological analysis of these is done in order to know the Latin or Greek root and the survival or otherwise of Latin characteristics in their writing. It is concluded that there are words that still preserve parts of the Latin root and meanings that are no longer in common use.

One of these opportunities is the use of open-ended questions with requests for oral instead of written answers, which may facilitate the answer process and result in more in-depth and unfiltered information. Whereas it is now possible to collect oral answers on smartphones, we still lack studies on the impact of this novel answer format on the characteristics of respondents' answers. In this study, we compare the linguistic and content characteristics of written versus oral answers to political attitude questions. For this purpose, we conducted an experiment in a smartphone survey (N = 2402) and randomly assigned respondents to an answer format (written or oral). Oral answers were collected via the open source 'SurveyVoice (SVoice)' tool, whereas written answers were typed in via the smartphone keypad. Applying length analysis, lexical structure analysis, sentiment analysis and structural topic models, our results reveal that written and oral answers differ substantially from each other in terms of lengths, structures, sentiments and topics. We find evidence that written answers are characterized by an intentional and conscious answering, whereas oral answers are characterized by an intuitive and spontaneous answering.

S	Weitzel, L; Prati, RC; Aguiar, RF		Pedrycz, W; Chen, SM		Weitzel, Leila; Prati, Ronaldo Cristiano; Aguiar, Raul Freire			The Comprehension of Figurative Language: What Is the Influence of Irony and Sarcasm on NLP Techniques?	SENTIMENT ANALYSIS AND ONTOLOGY ENGINEERING: AN ENVIRONMENT OF COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE	Studies in Computational Intelligence		English	Article; Book Chapter						Sentiment analysis; Irony; Sarcasm; Figurative language; Machine learning; Natural language processing		Due to the growing volume of available textual information, there is a great demand for Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques that can automatically process and manage texts, supporting the information retrieval and communication in core areas of society (e.g. healthcare, business, and science). NLP techniques have to tackle the often ambiguous and linguistic structures that people use in everyday speech. As such, there are many issues that have to be considered, for instance slang, grammatical errors, regional dialects, figurative language, etc. Figurative Language (FL), such as irony, sarcasm, simile, and metaphor, poses a serious challenge to NLP systems. FL is a frequent phenomenon within human communication, occurring both in spoken and written discourse including books, websites, fora, chats, social network posts, news articles and product reviews. Indeed, knowing what people think can help companies, political parties, and other public entities in strategizing and decision-making polices. When people are engaged in an informal conversation, they almost inevitably use irony (or sarcasm) to express something else or different than stated by the literal sentence meaning. Sentiment analysis methods can be easily misled by the presence of words that have a strong polarity but are used sarcastically, which means that the opposite polarity was intended. Several efforts have been recently devoted to detect and tackle FL phenomena in social media. Many of applications rely on task-specific lexicons (e.g. dictionaries, word classifications) or Machine Learning algorithms. Increasingly, numerous companies have begun to leverage automated methods for inferring consumer sentiment from online reviews and other sources. A system capable of interpreting FL would be extremely beneficial to a wide range of practical NLP applications. In this sense, this chapter aims at evaluating how two specific domains of FL, sarcasm and irony, affect Sentiment Analysis (SA) tools. The study's ultimate goal is to find out if FL hinders the performance (polarity detection) of SA systems due to the presence of ironic context. Our results indicate that computational intelligence approaches are more suitable in presence of irony and sarcasm in Twitter classification.

The development of a lexicographic resource of this kind builds on the various experiences in the creation of corpus-based online dictionaries (especially at the Leibniz Institute for the German Language, Mannheim) and on methods of corpus-based lexicology as well as interaction analysis. As a multimedia prototype for the corpus-based lexicographic treatment of spoken language phenomena, it occupies an innovative position in the landscape of online lexicography. In the section on the presentation of the LeGeDe-project, the article deals in detail with research questions relevant to the project, the project goals, the corpus data basis and empirically determined expectations of a resource on spoken German. The presentation of the complex structure of the LeGeDe-prototype is illustrated with numerous examples. Apart from the central information on the macro- and microstructure and the lexicographical outer texts, the various linking and access structures are shown. In addition to the final conclusion, the article concludes with an outlook that provides extensive suggestions for future lexicographic work with spoken language corpus data.

This usually takes the shape of a written document, granted before a notary public as required by law, allowing one person to appoint another person to act on his/her behalf. Civil law and common law systems differ considerably with respect to requirements, formalities and range of powers permitted. In cross-border transactions, a translation is required to certify the authority given to third parties who do not speak the language. Bearing this in mind, a comparable corpus of authentic Portuguese and British texts (from England and Wales, and Northern Ireland) pertaining to this legal genre (12 procuracoes and 24 PoA) is analysed to identify its characteristics at functional, situational, thematic, lexical and grammatical levels.

One of the advertisements used the slogan Grab a drink and show off those PJ Powers'. The singer, PJ Powers, was informed of this advertisement and Powers accused Spar not only of using her name without her permission but also of poking fun at her past struggle with alcohol addiction. Taking into account the main assumptions of relevance theory and the possible general knowledge of the average South African as well as the co-text and context of the advertisement, I will illustrate that consumers in South Africa are highly likely to associate the lexical co-occurrence PJ Powers' with the singer and not with a pyjama party theme' suggested by Spar in its apology. A small corpus based on newspaper texts, two different corpus analysis tools, Antconc and Leximancer, and a Google search are used to support my arguments.

We may find examples of verbal dueling in the folklore of many cultures (Italian Contrasto, Puerto Rican Relajo, Georgian Kapiaoba - Leksaoba, English and Scottish Flyting, Afro-American The dozens, etc.). Scientific literature on verbal duels of different cultures is large and complex (A. Dundes, R. Abrahams, J. Leach, M. Glazer, V. Pagliai, D. Schwebel, E. Koch, S. Sowayan). Some of the scholars aim at studying one particular type of verbal battle, typical to one culture only, others compare and contradict versions of these contests. Scientists have studied the topic of verbal aggressiveness in poetic duels, have drawn parallels between verbal duels and rap battles, investigated the connections between oral traditions and literary works. The aim of the article is to compare two different types of verbal duels (kapiaoba / leksaoba and flyting) of two different cultures - Scottish and Georgian and to see similarities and differences between these traditions, to examine their lexical and stylistic value. More precisely the goal of the author is to scrutinize the texts of oral verbal duels and study the examples of insults that comprise obscenities and profanities. The analysis revealed that Flyting and Kapiaoba are ritualized forms of exchanging insults, almost amounting to a competition. Despite the harsh and elaborate exchange of insults, and violent language, they are intended as a jovial form of entertainment. They have more similarities than differences. Similarities are found in dramatic situation, structure, content. The insulting word types coincide with each other: 1) dirty words (words referring to sex and excretion); 2) blasphemy and profanity; 3) animal abuse in which a human being is equated with an animal). Differences between kapias and flytings are in setting (Kapias - at wedding parties, birthday parties; flyting as an activity is solely confined to the court) and the degree of threats and insulting words. Flytings are more aggressive than kapias. Flyters use a collection of foul and abusive epithets in succession. They directly address their opponents and use a long list of abusive compound words and adjectives. In Kapias duelists are more reserved in using harsh words and try to soften offensive words with euphemistic ones. The language used by Georgian duelists is metaphorical; implicit meaning reside in most of the words and is less abusive.

It refers to a classification problem where the main focus is to predict the polarity of words and then classify them into positive or negative sentiment. Sentiment analysis over Twitter offers people a fast and effective way to measure the public's feelings towards their party and politicians. The primary issue in previous sentiment analysis techniques is the determination of the most appropriate classifier for a given classification problem. If one classifier is chosen from the available classifiers, then there is no surety in the best performance on unseen data. So to reduce the risk of selecting an inappropriate classifier, we are combining the outputs of a set of classifiers. Thus in this paper, we use an approach that automatically classifies the sentiment of tweets by combining machine learning classifiers with lexicon based classifier. The new combination of classifiers are SentiWordNet classifier, naive bayes classifier and hidden markov model classifier. Here positivity or negativity of each tweet is determined by using the majority voting principle on the result of these three classifiers. Thus we were used this sentiment classifier for finding political sentiment from real time tweets. Thus we have got an improved accuracy in sentiment analysis using classifier ensemble Approach. Our method also uses negation handling and word sense disambiguation to achieve high accuracy.

Sentiment analysis can be helpful in improving marketing strategy for a product or customer services, providing information about in general public sentiment for a political party or candidate etc. Over the years, various techniques have been developed to provide user with better sentiment classification. These techniques have evolved from lexicon based to machine learning and now to deep learning. But there is an inherent uncertainty in natural language which could not be handled even by the most advanced deep learning techniques. Deep learning networks perform automatic feature extraction from given data. But, fuzzy logic helps us to deal with this uncertainty by providing us with decision making capabilities in the presence of ambiguity. Our aim is to improve sentiment analysis prediction for textual data by incorporating fuzziness with deep learning. So, in this paper we have combined the learning capabilities of deep learning and uncertainty handling abilities of fuzzy logic to provide more appropriate sentiment prediction to the user. We have used LSTM, a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) for sentiment prediction. These networks have helped us to improve prediction accuracy as they are capable of dealing with long-term dependencies in the data.

J	Bran, R				Bran, Razvan			The Romanian Elements in the Textbooks of Spanish (L2) Published in Romania under the Communist Regime	PHILOLOGICA JASSYENSIA			Spanish	Article						textbooks of Spanish L2; Romanian cultural elements; communism; ideology; propaganda; intercultural competence		This paper looks at the textbooks of Spanish (L2), published in Romania during the communist regime and designed for the public educational system. More precisely, it investigates the presence of elements related to the Romanian culture, from the angle of the ideological communist propaganda. The communist regime reformed the whole educational system in order to create the "new man" in the spirit of its values and ideology. In the first period of Ceausescu's regime, characterised by ideological relaxation, among other things, Romanians could travel more and started learning foreign languages. In this social and political context, a great deal of foreign languages materials were published in Romania (i.e. grammars, dictionaries, exercise books etc.). The Spanish (L2) textbooks published in this period aimed, among others, at developing the national identity through texts and visual elements that highlighted Romania's natural beauties, glorious past, economic development etc. Moreover, the grafic support depicts Romanian factories, representative buildings, monuments, landscapes, but few cultural elements related to the Spanish speaking world. The communist ideology promoted the national history, the traditions, natural beauties and the economic development. These elements played an important role in shaping the patriotism and national pride. The textbooks we analysed here contain a great variety of Romanian cultural elements and therefore do not develop the intercultural competence. Thus, they became an instrument of the political propaganda, whose main aim is to highlight the activity of the Romanian Communist Party and its achievements.

J	Salcines, RPR				Ripoll Salcines, Rodolfo Pascual			THE EXCLUSIVE ECONOMIC ZONE AND THE CONCEPT OF SOVEREIGNTY IN THE CUBAN CONSTITUTION	REVISTA UNIVERSIDAD Y SOCIEDAD			Spanish	Article						Cuban constitution; exclusive economic zone; sovereignty; law of the sea		Article 11 of the Cuban Constitution proclaims the sovereignty of the State over the national territory, including the Territorial Sea, as well as over the natural resources situated in its territory and in the Exclusive Economic Zone. However, the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea of 1982, of which Cuba is a State party, defines that the sovereignty of a State extends up to the Territorial Sea. A comparison of these legal texts shows that the term sovereignty is used to refer to faculties of the State in different geographical spaces. The consideration of a possible proclamation of an extraterritorial sovereignty, in contradiction with the relevant international norms, depends on the definition, interpretation and application of the concept of sovereignty. Consequently, the objective of this article is to realize some lexical and epistemological juridical reflections in relation to the concept of sovereignty in International Law and, within it, in the Law of the Sea as a branch of particular interest. The juridical research methodology is used, with the application of the exegetical-analytical, the theoretical-juridical and the historic-juridical methods. It is concluded that, despite the polysemy and the synonymy with which it is currently used as a political-juridical term, sovereignty has expressly a territorial character in the Law of the Sea. Therefore, it is not applicable in the Exclusive Economic Zone. Accordingly, it is suggested to correct the said constitutional article in accordance with International Law.

In the prior work, we have designed and developed an international clinical data exchange system named Global Dolphin, technically achieving the goal of health information exchange between China and Japan. However, to put the system into practical use, we have to take the different privacy protection rules into account. In the clinical data exchange implementation, we tried to conform to the stricter privacy protection standards and designed a protected health information (PHI) de-identification system to keep the personal information secure from third parties. Since China and Japan do not yet have detailed rules and guidelines such as the safe harbor method in Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), thus we have referenced some of the HIPAA rules and guidelines about PHI, and used a dictionary and regular expressions pattern matching de-identification means to protect personal privacy.

Minimally, such a system should be capable of distinguishing between question-bearing turns and other types of utterances. However, this is a non-trivial task, since spontaneous speech tends to have incomplete syntactic, and even ungrammatical, structure and is characterized by disfluencies, repairs and other non-linguistic vocalizations that make simple rule based pattern learning difficult. In this paper, we present a system for identifying question-bearing turns in spontaneous multi-party speech (ICSI Meeting Corpus) using lexical and prosodic evidence. On a balanced test set, our system achieves an accuracy of 71.9% for the binary question vs. non-question classification task. Further, we investigate the robustness of our proposed technique to uncertainty in the lexical feature stream (e.g. caused by speech recognition errors). Our experiments indicate that classification accuracy of the proposed method is robust to errors in the text stream, dropping only about 0.8% for every 10% increase in word error rate (WER).

The role of religion is examined in these texts. A corpus of posters and programs from the period 2016-19 were utilized for this analysis. The study covers all state elections in this period: the German federal elections of 2017 and the elections to the European Parliament in 2019. Since election posters can be understood as multimodal texts, image research was conducted first. This revealed that only a few religion-related motifs were used on election posters. This was also the case for the imagery in the election manifestos. The analysis of the lexicon yielded different results. For both types of texts, religion-related lexicons referring to Islam clearly dominate compared to Christianity. The lexical analysis also shows that the subject of Judaism does not play any significant role in either type of text. With regard to embedding in discourses, the context and metaphor analysis shows the references to religious issues found and delimit identity and alterity. In both cases, only the superficial and external aspects are referred to. Christianity, as an identity reference, remains completely unspecific, whereas Islam is used as a threat scenario. In not one case is there engagement with the contents of faith. The central result of the study is that right-wing populist election advertising is not about a real confrontation between Christianity and Islam. Rather, the election campaign focuses on the rejection of Islam and thus on the rejection of migration.

While country-country relations are not exactly new for human learning, we illustrate that one can extract the knowledge of such sophisticated relations solely from data. Using the global dyadic events data that record the involving parties and timestamp, we identify the underlying causal network with common initiators or reactors, as well as the nature of pairwise relations as a counterfactual reasoning problem, thereby deriving the significance of causal effects in the network. To formalize the discovery process, we first validate some country-country relations in a small-world network structure after exploitative runs over the entire data set, suggesting the traditional allies and rivals as we know in the real world. Further, we use sentimental analysis based on Wikipedia text data to match the significance of bilateral relations in the causal discovery. Our results show that using time series data of dyadic event counts alone, combined with lexical-based validation, can extract the knowledge of bilateral and multilateral relations and has potential to be a means to measuring and monitoring the climate of complex geopolitics.

This information needs to be put into a structured form before it can be used by automated systems. Coreference resolution is a step in the transformation of narratives into a structured form. Methods This study presents a medical coreference resolution system (MCORES) for noun phrases in four frequently used clinical semantic categories: persons, problems, treatments, and tests. MCORES treats coreference resolution as a binary classification task. Given a pair of concepts from a semantic category, it determines coreferent pairs and clusters them into chains. MCORES uses an enhanced set of lexical, syntactic, and semantic features. Some MCORES features measure the distance between various representations of the concepts in a pair and can be asymmetric. Results and Conclusion MCORES was compared with an in-house baseline that uses only single-perspective 'token overlap' and 'number agreement' features. MCORES was shown to outperform the baseline; its enhanced features contribute significantly to performance. In addition to the baseline, MCORES was compared against two available third-party, open-domain systems, RECONCILEACL09 and the Beautiful Anaphora Resolution Toolkit (BART). MCORES was shown to outperform both of these systems on clinical records.

However, since many useful relations are excluded in databases and remain hidden in raw text, a study on automatic interaction extraction from text is important in bioinformatics field. Results: Here, we suggest two kinds of kernel methods for genic interaction extraction, considering the structural aspects of sentences. First, we improve our prior dependency kernel by modifying the kernel function so that it can involve various substructures in terms of ( 1) e-walks, ( 2) partial match, ( 3) non-contiguous paths, and ( 4) different significance of substructures. Second, we propose the walk-weighted subsequence kernel to parameterize non-contiguous syntactic structures as well as semantic roles and lexical features, which makes learning structural aspects from a small amount of training data effective. Furthermore, we distinguish the significances of parameters such as syntactic locality, semantic roles, and lexical features by varying their weights. Conclusions: We addressed the genic interaction problem with various dependency kernels and suggested various structural kernel scenarios based on the directed shortest dependency path connecting two entities. Consequently, we obtained promising results over genic interaction data sets with the walk-weighted subsequence kernel. The results are compared using automatically parsed third party protein-protein interaction (PPI) data as well as perfectly syntactic labeled PPI data.

J	Ciapuscio, GE				Elena Ciapuscio, Guiomar			The agreement letter: Linguistics as a hermeneutic tool in professional discourse	REVISTA SIGNOS			English	Article						Key Words; Professional genres; business agreement letter; forensic linguistics; ambiguity; text interpretation		This paper stems from the conviction that Linguistics should not be limited to description and theorisation efforts, but also assume a more active and committed role in improving the exchanges that take place in the field of specialised or professional communication. The purpose of this article is twofold: to describe and characterize a prospective professional genre, the business agreement letter, and to provide specific knowledge about the linguistic expertise process on the basis of a relevant experience. From the Text Linguistics point of view (Schroder, 1991; Ciapuscio, 2003, 2016; Adamzik, 2004, 2016), and also taking into account the lexical-grammatical analysis, this article provides a generic description of the business agreement letter, with the aim of describing expectations and protecting the signatory parties from events that may take place in the future, which frequently result in interpretive problems. The case under analysis corresponds to an extensive legal and commercial controversy that arose in Argentina, as a result of a share purchase-sale contract, which required the collaboration of a linguistic expert. In this sense, it provides general knowledge about the linguistic expertise process and evidence on the relevance of linguistic advice services during the production and interpretation of professional texts.

J	Mellinger, CD				Mellinger, Christopher D.			Equal access to the courts in translation: a corpus-driven study on translation shifts in waivers of counsel	PERSPECTIVES-STUDIES IN TRANSLATION THEORY AND PRACTICE			English	Article						Language access; legal translation; corpus; due process		As the number of limited English proficiency speakers in the United States continues to increase, court administrators face mounting pressure to ensure that services are provided to linguistic minorities and that the availability and adequacy of these services meet this growing need and provide equal footing to non-English-speaking litigants. Several states now provide legal forms and documentation in multiple languages in order to provide greater transparency and access to the legal system and to ensure due process for non-English-speaking parties. The translation process and quality control/assurance mechanisms, however, vary across these programs. This corpus-driven study examines translations of court-provided waivers of counsel. The results reveal shifts potentially attributable to a residual effect of the source language or to differing legal systems. Problematic target language renditions at the lexical and syntactic level potentially alter the end user's ability to understand the performative nature of the source text. Changes to the (perceived) function in the target language may hinder equal access to the legal system. The results raise important questions related to ethics, equal access, and due process, while also serving as a step toward understanding the multilingual legal environment in the United States.

In this paper, integrity is focused for verification. Encrypted data which is stored in secure out-sourcing storage should be verified for integrity because of traitors in every field. Web browsers connect Web Application Programming Interfaces (API) to the cloud. Virtual Private Server (VPS) which is hosted in the cloud is deployed using web browsers. This paper proposes Integrity Service Application Model (which is installed in the VPS) with prevention of cryptanalytic attacks. Proposed work is implemented in unmanaged VPS and results are analyzed. Brute force attack, dictionary attack, cut and paste attack, Denial of Service attack, replay attack, known plain text attack and cipher text only attacks are prevented in this paper. Authentication techniques used for client verification are Random Key Code using One Time Password (OTP) and dynamic missing random number puzzle. Major advantage of the proposed paper is that the integrity is verified by private auditing using Proof of Retrievability method. Third Party Auditor (TPA) who is trusted partially is eliminated.

However, most efforts have addressed the benchmarking of new algorithms rather than user operational needs. Bridging the gap between BioTM researchers and biologists' needs is crucial to solve real-world problems and promote further research. We present @Note, a platform for BioTM that aims at the effective translation of the advances between three distinct classes of users: biologists, text miners and software developers. Its main functional contributions are the ability to process abstracts and full-texts; an information retrieval module enabling PubMed search and journal crawling; a pre-processing module with PDF-to-text conversion, tokenisation and stopword removal; a semantic annotation schema: a lexicon-based annotator: a user-friendly annotation view that allows to correct annotations and a Text Mining Module supporting dataset preparation and algorithm evaluation. @Note improves the interoperability, modularity and flexibility when integrating in-home and open-source third-party components. Its component-based architecture allows the rapid development of new applications, emphasizing the principles of transparency and simplicity of use. Although it is still on-going, it has already allowed the development of applications that are currently being used. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The goal is to fit its lexicon and language model (LM) so that the system could be employed for the automatic transcription of old spoken documents in the Czech Radio archive. The main problem is the lack of texts (in electronic form) from the 1945-1990 period. The only available and large enough source is digitized copies of Rude Pravo, the newspaper of the former Communist party of Czechoslovakia, the actual ruling body in the state. The newspaper has been scanned and converted into text via an OCR software. However, the amount of OCR errors is very high and so we have to apply several text pre-processing techniques to get a corpus suitable for the lexicon and language model 'downdating' (i.e. adaptation to the past). The proposed techniques helped us a) to reduce the number of out-of-vocabulary strings from 8.5 to 6.4 millions, b) to identify 6.7 thousand history-conditioned word candidates to be added to the lexicon and c) to build a more appropriate LM. The adapted LVCSR system was evaluated on broadcast news from 1969-1989 where its word-error-rate decreased from 17.05 to 14.33%.

J	Maji, G; Mandal, S				Maji, Giridhar; Mandal, Sharmistha			A forward email based high capacity text steganography technique using a randomized and indexed word dictionary	MULTIMEDIA TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Text steganography; Email steganography; Indexed word dictionary; Data hiding in email cover; High capacity steganography; Secure and robust text steganography	COLOR	Text steganography is inherently difficult due to minimal redundant information space to hide secret payload. The same fact limits the hiding capacity and security too. In this study, a novel technique has been proposed using a randomized indexed word dictionary, and a list of email addresses to increase the hiding capacity and security. A forward email platform has been used as the cover, and email addresses in the carbon copy (CC) field contain secret data that are encoded using a randomized index-based word dictionary. The email username list and indexed word dictionary are both pre-shared between the communicating parties. But during every new communication, a random bitstream (temporary stego-key) is generated from the system time and communicated separately using public-key cryptography. This temporary stego-key is used to randomize the index values of the words in the dictionary. Most of the existing state-of-the-art techniques provide a hiding capacity of 6-10%. The proposed scheme achieves a capacity of 12.17% using some common secret text and email body text (cover text) as used in all other studies. The proposed technique provides higher hiding capacity and security by randomizing the word indexes every time using temporary stego-key. It is also free from statistical attacks, OCR based attacks, and does not depend on the use of any particular text processor.

The following methods and techniques were used in the work: comparative and hermeneutic method, etc. The study is based on the translation of Pushkin's novel, which was performed in the early 1950s, by Tatar poets Ahmet Iskhak, Ahmed Faizi and Shaykhi Mannur. In 1930s the novel was already magnificently translated by Fathi Burnash, but soon it was declared an "enemy of the people", and thus the regional committee of the party created a brigade of the best poets and ordered the translation to be published urgently. Based on the analysis of the novel in verse "Eugene Onegin" from the point of view of the lexical pictorial means of language use, we have discovered that Pushkin's language is full of rich imagery and a high degree of metaphorization and epithets. One of the most frequently used lexical stylistic devices in the novel in verse is metaphor and epithet. The author uses both simple and expanded metaphors. The latter can cover whole sentences or several sentences, forming the chain of metaphors for general semantics.

J	Magnien, A				Magnien, A			The sculptor A. Fr. D'Huez, biographer of Pierre Puget and Pierre Legros II	REVUE DE L ART			French	Article								Adrien-Francois D'Huez (Bailleul 1691-Arras 1753) is a little-known sculptor. He is barely mentioned in art history dictionaries (Bauchal, Lami, Thieme and Becker) and most of his works have been lost. He is principally remembered as the father of a better-known sculptor, Jean-Baptiste Cyprien D'Huez (Arras 1729-Paris 1793) who happened to be Jean-Baptiste II Lemoyne's (Paris 1704-Paris 1778) pupil and assistant. However new material recently discovered, a treaty on sculpture he wrote in 1720 held by the Doucet library, a collection of drawings dated 1732 in the library of the Institut of France and a few sculptures he made in Aix-en-Provence gives us better understanding of this artist's rather interesting provincial career. In his treaty La Sculpture, en Trois Parties (Arras, ms., 1720) on the history of sculpture in his times, D'Huez mentions Pierre Puget, about whom he gives previously unknown information, as well as Pierre II Legros whom he met in Rome, where he seems to have lived circa 1715-16 and may even have worked in Legros' workshop at the Palazzo Farnese. He admires these two artists very much and presents them as artistic models. His biographies of the two sculptors are classically structured. They consist in a historical sketch, a list of main works by the artist with some short commentaries and a more general description of the artist's physical and moral characteristics. These texts are given at the end of the article.										65	2	2	0	0	EDITIONS C N R S	PARIS	20/22 RUE ST. AMAND, 75015 PARIS, FRANCE	0035-1326			REV ART	Rev.

AstroEBSD: exploring new space in pattern indexing with methods launched from an astronomical approach	JOURNAL OF APPLIED CRYSTALLOGRAPHY			English	Article						electron Kikuchi diffraction; indexing; astronomy; scanning electron microscopy; electron backscatter diffraction; EBSD	ELECTRON BACKSCATTER DIFFRACTION; RELATE 2 SETS; CRYSTAL ORIENTATIONS; DICTIONARY APPROACH; MATCHING ALGORITHM; LOCAL TEXTURE; EBSD; RESOLUTION; IDENTIFICATION; CALIBRATION	Electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) is a technique used to measure crystallographic features in the scanning electron microscope. The technique is highly automated and readily accessible in many laboratories. EBSD pattern indexing is conventionally performed with raw electron backscatter patterns. These patterns are software processed to locate the band centres (and sometimes edges) from which the crystallographic index of each band is determined. Once a consistent index for many bands is obtained, the crystal orientation with respect to a reference sample and detector orientation can be determined and presented. Unfortunately, because of challenges related to crystal symmetry, there are limited available pattern-indexing approaches and this has probably hampered open development of the technique. In this article, a new method of pattern indexing is presented, based upon a method with which satellites locate themselves in the night sky, and its effectiveness is systematically demonstrated using dynamical simulations and real experimental patterns. The benefit of releasing this new algorithm as open-source software is demonstrated when this indexing process is utilized, together with dynamical solutions, to provide some of the first accuracy assessments of an indexing solution. In disclosing a new indexing algorithm, and software processing toolkit, the authors hope to open up EBSD developments to more users. The software code and example data are released alongside this article for third party developments.

Design/methodology/approach NCapture extracted thousands of comments on multiple videos representing different experimental treatments and Leximancer revealed differences in the lexical patterns of user comments for different types of brands. Findings User comments consistently revealed hypothesized relationships between brand types, based on existing theory regarding motivations for nostalgia and the relationship between consumer preferences, online product ratings and purchases. These results demonstrate the viability of conducting quasi-experimental research in naturalistic settings via non-random groupings of YT videos and ATA of user comments. Research limitations/implications This research adopts a single quasi-experimental design: the non-equivalent group, after-only design. However, the same basic approach can be used with other quasi-experimental designs to examine different kinds of research questions. Originality/value Overall, this research points to the potential for ATA of comments on different categories of YT videos as a relatively straightforward approach for conducting field experiments that establish the ecological validity of laboratory findings. The method is easy to use and does not require the participation and cooperation of private, third party social media research companies.

J	Shcherbinin, AI; Shcherbinina, NG				Shcherbinin, Alexey, I; Shcherbinina, Nina G.			MODERN TRENDS IN UNIVERSITY CITY BRAND MODIFICATION	VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA-FILOSOFIYA-SOTSIOLOGIYA-POLITOLOGIYA-TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY SOCIOLOGY AND POLITICAL SCIENCE			Russian	Article						positioning policy; university city; frame; semiosphere; representation space; foreign students		This article examines modern trends in the modification of the brand "university city" in the context of communication. The first part is a theoretical analysis based on the main categories of semiotics. Thus, brand modification is considered within the semantic framework of the urban semiosphere, and the brand here means "text" in the interpretation of Yu.M. Lotman. In the context of the authors' concept of the political construction of reality, the generating subject of communication is the party that " writes" the text and also takes care of its coding and understanding. In this regard, the constructivist role, considered through the concepts of "border" and the change of places of the "core" and "periphery" of the urban semiosphere, is transferred from authorities to "active users". At the same time, communication is understood as an equivalent of cultural dialogue with its "translation". This kind of communication moves away from the absolutely linear form of advertising communication of brands and approaches the network configuration of "discussing" brands and giving them values, uniqueness, and thus identity. All this reveals the semiosis of the city brand as a sign and points to the correction of its meaning. Thus, active "users" generate their own "lexicodes" for discussing the topic of the city and spontaneously create a "frame" for the required "university city" and university. The second part of the article reveals the figurative meaning of the " university city" frame by examining the opinions of foreign students. A concrete example of their views regarding a relevant "university city" is shown by a survey of foreign students in Tomsk. The survey revealed the structure of interrelated characteristics that indicate the representative properties of Tomsk and articulate its special significance. In fact, this is a kind of implementation of the right to the city (H. Lefebvre). Empirical research has shown that the image of Tomsk is structured, as it were, on two levels: everyday and symbolic. In general, the form of the generalized image of Tomsk resembles the character of a person, and the city-subject appears as democratic and sociable. The symbolic hypostasis of Tomsk is a city-university, an ideal environment and a favorable place to study at. Thus, based on the culture of dialogue, it is feasible to exchange symbolic positions and create a specific language of communication, in which it is advisable to formulate a semiotically modified idea of a new positioning of the "university city".

J	Kukueva, GV				Kukueva, Galina Vasilyevna			Complex Techniques of Dialogicity in Author's Speech of V. M. Shukshin's Stories-Essays	NAUCHNYI DIALOG			Russian	Article						language of V. M. Shukshin's prose; story-essay; author's speech; dialogue; methods of text dialogization		The problem of the dialogicity as a constitutional principle that organizes the texts of short fiction by V. M. Shukshin is covered. The material of the study are the writer's stories-essays, which are characterized by intertwining the essay trends and genre characteristics of short stories, anecdote and scenes. The object of the research is the author's speech; the subject of the research is the complex methods of dialogicity functioning in the speech part of the narrator of short stories-essays. The aim of the work is to analyze complex methods of dialogicity and to determine their role in the author's speech of stories-essays. The mechanism of dialogicity of V. M. Shukshin's texts is considered on the basis of the analysis of a separate group of poetic techniques functioning in the author' speech of short stories-essays. As the methods of the dialogic spectrum proper, the article describes the dialogization and citation, which are structurally and semantically important elements determined by the communicative task of the author. It is established that the functioning of the methods of the dialogic spectrum proper is supported by syntactic-stylistic techniques: parcelling, insertion, lexical repetition. It is shown that the complex functioning of the techniques leads to the formation of polyphony within the speech party of the narrator, as a result of which the monosubject of the narrative, peculiar to the genre form of the essay, is lost. The author proves that within the author's speech additional narrative links are explicated, immersing the reader in the polyphony of voices, different points of view.

J	Hanzlick, RL				Hanzlick, RL		Autopsy Comm Coll Amer Patholo	The autopsy lexicon - Suggested headings for the autopsy report	ARCHIVES OF PATHOLOGY & LABORATORY MEDICINE			English	Article							PRACTICE GUIDELINES; PATHOLOGY	Context-Although standard autopsy texts and other publications discuss the general content of autopsy reports, and some provide examples of autopsy report formats, no publication to date has recommended specific headings for autopsy report organization. The College of American Pathologists Autopsy Committee decided it would be helpful to provide suggestions for autopsy report headings to foster more standardized autopsy reporting, to facilitate review of reports by third parties, and to facilitate searches of electronically stored autopsy reports. Objectives,-To create a model document (named the Autopsy Lexicon), which defines standard categories of information that are useful to include in autopsy reports; to offer specific wording for the headings of various sections of the report; and to explain the rationale for including the various items of information and headings. Participants and Methods,The members of the Autopsy Committee of the College of American Pathologists prepared the document by reviewing various examples of autopsy report formats, identifying specific categories of information usually contained in such reports, and developing wording for various sections of the autopsy report that would contain specific information. A draft was submitted to 45 members (including 12 forensic pathologists) of the College of American Pathologists for review, comment, and reality testing. Reviewers included pathologists from both community and academic settings, Comments of reviewers were incorporated to the extent possible. Results,The Autopsy Lexicon was prepared and is a model document for autopsy pathologists who wish to define an autopsy template of headings for consistent organization of autopsy reports. Conclusions-The Autopsy Lexicon is available to foster more uniform reporting of autopsy information, which may facilitate review of autopsy reports tend retrieval of information from electronically stored autopsy reports.

This means that the two parties cannot converse eye-to-eye, hampering the quality of visual communication. One conventional approach to the gaze mismatch problem is to synthesize a gaze-corrected face image as viewed from center of the screen via depth-image-based rendering (DIBR), assuming texture and depth maps are available at the camera-captured viewpoint(s). Due to self-occlusion, however, there will be missing pixels in the DIBR-synthesized view image that require satisfactory filling. In this paper, we propose to jointly solve the hole-filling problem and the face beautification problem (subtle modifications of facial features to enhance attractiveness of the rendered face) via a unified dual sparse coding framework. Specifically, we first train two dictionaries separately: one for face images of the intended conference subject, one for images of "beautiful" human faces. During synthesis, we simultaneously seek two code vectors-one is sparse in the first dictionary and explains the available DIBR-synthesized pixels, the other is sparse in the second dictionary and matches well with the first vector up to a restricted linear transform. This ensures a good match with the intended target face, while increasing proximity to " beautiful" facial features to improve attractiveness. Experimental results show naturally rendered human faces with noticeably improved attractiveness.

J	Glancy, F; Biros, DP; Liang, N; Luse, A				Glancy, Fletcher; Biros, David P.; Liang, Nan; Luse, Andy			Classification of malicious insiders and the association of the forms of attacks	JOURNAL OF CRIMINAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						Personality disorders; Attack types; Expressive attacks; Insider; Instrumental attacks; Malicious	VULNERABLE NARCISSISM; PROACTIVE AGGRESSION; COMPUTER CRIME; PERSONALITY; DETERRENCE; BEHAVIOR; HOSTILE; TRAITS; ABUSE; VALIDATION	Purpose The authors argue that the current studies about malicious insiders confuse the fact that malicious attacks belong to two different categories, namely, those that launch instrumental attacks and expressive attacks. The authors collect malicious insider data from publicly available sources and use text-mining techniques to analyze the association between malicious insiders' characteristics and the different types of attack. Design/methodology/approach The authors investigated the relationship between personality characteristics and different types of malicious attacks. For the personality characteristics, the authors use the same method as Lianget al.(2016), which extracted these characteristics based on a keyword-characteristic dictionary. For different types of malicious attacks, two raters rated each case based on criteria modified from criminology research to determine the degree of expressiveness and instrumentality. Findings The results show that malicious insiders who are manipulative or seeking personal gain tend to carry out instrumental attacks. Malicious insiders who are arrogant tend to conduct expressive attacks. Research limitations/implications This study uses third party articles to identify the personality characteristics of known malicious insiders. As such, not all personality characteristics may have been reported. Data availability was an issue. Practical implications Understanding if different personality characteristics lead different types of attacks can help managers identify employees who exhibit them and mitigate an attack before it occurs. Social implications Malicious insider attacks can have devastating results on businesses and employees. Help to identify potential malicious insiders before they act, may prevent undue harm. Originality/value This study used 132 cases of none malicious insiders to examine their attack objectives. No other study that the authors know of used that many cases.

Gaze mismatch is a common problem in video conferencing, where the viewpoint captured by a camera (usually located above or below a display monitor) is not aligned with the gaze direction of the human subject, who typically looks at his counterpart in the center of the screen. This means that the two parties cannot converse eye-to-eye, hampering the visual communication experience. A recent popular approach to the gaze mismatch problem is to synthesize a gaze-corrected face image as viewed from the screen center via depth-image-based rendering (DIBR), assuming texture and depth maps are both available at the camera-captured viewpoint. Due to self-occlusion, however, there will be missing pixels in the DIBR-synthesized view image that require satisfactory filling. In this paper, we propose to jointly solve the hole-filling problem and the face beautification problem (subtle modifications of facial components and contour to enhance attractiveness of the rendered face) using dual sparsity prior. Specifically, prior to the start of a video conference session, we first train two dictionaries separately offline using two large data sets: one with general face images, and the other with "beautiful" human faces, which means faces with high beauty scores. During the actual conference session, we solve the hole-filling and facial components beautification problems simultaneously by seeking two code vectors-one is sparse in the first dictionary and explains the available DIBR-synthesized pixels, the other is sparse in the second dictionary and matches well with the first vector in terms of feature space distance. This ensures an acceptable level of recognizability of the conference subject, while increasing proximity to "beautiful" facial features to improve attractiveness. Experimental results show naturally rendered human faces with noticeably improved attractiveness.

Pechory in the Komi Republic. The source for the writing of the work was the ethnographic field materials collected by the author in the Ust-Tsilemsky region of the Komi Republic and the corpus of Ust-Tsilma phraseological units, proverbs, and sayings identified from dictionaries. As a concept of culture, hospitality is widely represented in paremias, where situations related to hospitality are revealed allegorically, norms, attitudes and prescriptions in the behavior of contacting parties are comprehended, and the value of guest contacts in establishing and maintaining social ties is revealed. On the stated topic, terms and expressions are presented and analyzed that characterize the hosts and guests, depending on various situations (hospitality - inhospitable, meeting - farewell, etc.). The article reveals that hospitality was of great educational value, familiarizing children with the norms of hospitality was based not only on personal observations and examples, but also with the use of stable expressions and texts. The study showed that guest communication brought together not only relatives, but also representatives of the community as a whole. It was revealed that despite the well-known closeness of the Old Believers-bespopovtsy, they showed friendliness and mutual understanding to the representatives of other confessions, provided them with shelter and food. In the picture of the world of Russian Old Believers-bespopovtsy Ust-Tsilma, hospitality was of great importance in the preservation and development of the enduring value of their existence.

Cognitive Factors as a Key to Plain-Sense Biblical Interpretation: Resolving Cruxes in Gen 18:1-15 and 32:23-33	OPEN THEOLOGY			English	Article						Agency; Angels; Cognitive scripts; Communication; Lexical semantics; Online language processing; Messaging; Messengers; Narrative conventions; Participant reference tracking; Pragmatics; 'ish (the Hebrew word)	PREDICTION; MESSENGERS; ABSENCE	Both the accounts of Abraham's three visitors (Gen 18:1-15) and of Jacob's nighttime intruder (32:2333) are famous interpretive cruxes. This article shows why the plain sense is that both Abraham and Jacob recognize right away that the newly introduced figures represent their deity. It does this by:(1) accounting for the place of messengers in the mental life of ancient Israel; (2) recovering an under-appreciated yet cognitively based narrative convention regarding messengers; (3) setting the starting point of each narrative with care; (4) attending to the semantics and pragmatics of the main noun in both accounts; and (5) emulating the online processing of language that an audience's mind automatically employs, which is incremental and prediction-driven. In the emulation exercise, the audience's mental parser arrives at a "recipient recognition" (RR) construal quickly-already before the end of 18:2, and by the end of 32:25. Furthermore, handling 32:25 in this manner resolves a third crux at the same time (32:2-3). An RR construal is cognitively favored because it yields a coherent and informative text, unlike the "obscured origin" (OO) construal that theologians presently favor. Meanwhile, the emulation validates a previously proposed hypothesis that the noun (sic)'aleph 'is functions as the generic label for designating an "agent"-that is, someone who is representing the interests of another party. All told, this article employs a variety of cognitive factors as keys to plain-sense interpretation. Finally, it touches upon the theological implications of the RR construal of the two passages under study.	[Stein, David E.

There is a growing awareness of the renewal of skills training and development methodologies, which need to be updated in line with educational objectives. These should include new approaches not only on topics such as family, society and education, but first, from the perspective of the educational factor. It is considered that competence is usually the ability of someone to adequately solve a problem, make the right decisions, perform a mission, or practice a profession in good conditions and with results recognized as good: "Competence is proved through sound knowledge, skill and ability to use them in carrying out a certain activity and to achieve results appreciated by others." The communication competence contains, according to Alina Pamfil, the verbal component and the nonverbal component. The verbal component also contains three dimensions: linguistic dimension (knowledge and use of the phonetic, lexical, morphological and syntactic aspects); textual dimension (knowing and using the rules and procedures that ensure the organization of a text: the connection between phrases, the coherence between the parties, the narrative textual structure, descriptive, argumentative; the discursive dimension (knowing and using the rules and procedures that make use of the language in the context: knowing the parameters of the communication situation, use of language registers, verbal interaction rules). Communication competence involves knowledge of the psychological, cultural and social rules that determine the use of the word in a social context, as well as the need to acquire other skills, beyond knowing the language, knowledge, context, culture.

J	Efremova, E				Efremova, Elena			HERE WILL BE A GARDEN-CITY: UTOPIAN IMAGE OF A CITY IN THE URALMASH PLANT NEWSPAPER	QUAESTIO ROSSICA			Russian	Article						utopia; Uralmash; UZTM; socialist city; garden-city; plant newspaper; factory newspaper; Za Tyazheloye Mashinostroyeniye; L. L. Averbakh		The article introduces the previously unstudied heavy engineering Uralmash Plant newspaper Za Tyazheloye Mashinostroyeniye published between 1934 and 1937; the newspaper is studied as a meta-text and a historical literary source where the editors and party leaders created a utopian image of an ideal city. During the period in question, L. L. Averbakh was secretary of the plant party committee and later secretary of the Ordzhonikidze district committee of Sverdlovsk, and partook in creative writing and literary criticism. The author analyzes the stylistic peculiarities of the key text underlying utopianism in the newspaper, To Herbert G. Wells. My Country and Uralmash in 1950 that creates an image of a future city based on the comparison of an imaginative future with the most urgent issues of reality. The author makes a supposition that it was L. L. Averbakh who authored the article as he had a substantial experience of editorial work and enthusiastically participated in the newspaper publication process. The article describes the main methods the Editorial Board used to create the image of a socialist city of the future and its introduction to the reader as one existing in reality. The fact that the editors of the newspaper perceived the Uralmash Plant as a single unity is proved by the choice of lexical means employed to characterize it, namely, "the socialist city", "our city", "the city of Uralmash", "the city of Soviet machines", "the city of happiness", "Sergo-City", "beautiful Uralmash". The article explores the role the Editorial Board assigned to the dwellers of Uralmash district; provided they observed the limits, they were allowed to criticize certain shortcomings, while the authors of articles used a multitude of grammar means (such as plural forms of first person proper pronouns and verbs) to create an illusion of conjoint actions. Together with the image of a new city of happiness, the newspaper of the Plant created a new calendar based on the date the Uralmash was launched which also manifested itself through other memorable dates. The shift to a new calendar is also emphasized by the constant contrast of the old world and the new one as well as the creation of an image of people of a new era. The author analyzes the image of the inhabitants of the utopian city who are described by means of constant metonymies gold and currency fund, and reveals the special everyday life canon of the first developers of the plant and determines the role the newspaper played in the process of Uralmash district population formation with them starting to realize their being a special group of people, standing higher than others up the social ladder. Additionally, the article explores the theme of childhood and the succession of generations in newspaper articles: it was children that were meant to become the lofty aim of the future for whose sake the constructors of the socialist city had to overcome so many hardships. The author singles out a number of lexical units recurrent in the articles such as happiness, joy, rejoicement used in different grammar forms to create the emotional tone of the newspaper. It turning to books published during the 1950s and devoted to the history of the Uralmash plant and to the memoirs of the inhabitants of the district leads the author to conclude that the basic elements of utopia one finds in the newspaper Za Tyazheloye Mashinostoryeniye got deeply rooted in the district's inhabitants' minds and formed their identity.

Verbal communication with the representatives of Chinese society enjoins on accounting ethnical psychology, which plays a highly significant role for all kinds of communication in China, including contacts in legal field, in particular drafting legal documents. In the process of verbal communication, the following distinctive features of Chinese ethnical identity must be taken into account: historicism, traditionalism, pragmatism, collective consciousness, syncretism, stability. The research proves that peculiarities of ethnopsychological consciousness determine specific features of drawing up legal documents, which makes the culturological approach essential for comparing language means of expressing legal notions in Chinese and Russian variants of business letters. In the course of research, linguoculturological analysis of Chinese business letters is being carried out: various linguoculturological components of legal field in official documents are investigated and ethnoculturogical peculiarities of communication in legal sphere are discovered. Lexical, grammatical and stylistic features of the texts of legal documents in Russian and Chinese are also considered in the research. Efficiency of Russian-Chinese communication in the legal field is fulfilled through a rather clear structure, words and phrases, where the parties explain their goals and intentions. We believe that achieving effective communication is only possible when there is no "notional ambiguity", dubiousness in legal documents, and when the text is brief and clear. It is the correctly built up text of the document that becomes the main tool for effective communication. (C) 2020 Published by European Publisher.

On the Purposes of Etymological Information in a General-Purpose Dictionary (On the Example of the Dictionary of the Russian Language of the 21st Century)	VOPROSY LEKSIKOGRAFII-RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF LEXICOGRAPHY			Russian	Article						lexicography; general-purpose dictionaries; etymology; dictionary entry; borrowed lexis; contemporary Russian		In the article, the purposes of etymological information in a general-purpose dictionary entry are discussed. The research concerns the newly borrowed vocabulary of the contemporary Russian language. In their analysis, the authors rely on their experience in working on the Dictionary of the Russian Language of the 21st Century project (Dictionary) led by G.N. Sklyarevskaya, and refer to its working materials. The Dictionary aims at describing the contemporary Russian language in its ultimate richness and variety. Its scope thus includes a great number of recent borrowings, both special terms and words in general use. The core of this category of words is formed by (but not confined to) the terms of sciences actively developing nowadays, the vocabulary of various professional groups as well as neologisms designating the newest notions and objects of everyday life (e.g., apdeyt 'update', implant 'implant', kollayder 'collider', autsorsing 'outsourcing', vebinar 'webinar', bloger 'blogger', khard-rok 'hard-rock', tok-shou 'talk show'). The words that are used in the Russian texts in Latin or both in Cyrillic and Latin forms are also taken into consideration (after party, ATL-reklama 'ATL advertising', al fa-versiya and alfa-versiva 'alpha version', wi-fi and vay-fav 'Wi-Fi', VIP and VIP 'VIP'). To describe this lexis, new etymological information sections must be compiled, which contain data on the immediate source and explain the literal meaning of an etymon and its morphological structure. The following aspects of a lexicographical description turn out to correlate with the etymological section: the choice of spelling and pronunciation variants, the elaboration of dictionary definitions and usage examples, and the distinguishing between homonymy and polysemy. The research has shown that etymological information is closely related to the main sections of a dictionary entry such as the headword, the definition and illustrative examples. Etymology is regarded as one of the criteria for the determination of spelling and pronunciation of the words whose forms have not yet been firmly established in the Russian language. On the other hand, descriptive definitions and examples containing cultural and historical information complement the clarification of the morphological and semantic structure of the etymon presented in the etymological section. Thereby it is asserted in the article that despite the widespread evaluation of etymology in a synchronic dictionary as a marginal component intended mainly to satisfy the readers' curiosity it seems rather to be an integral part of a lexicographical description, being to a considerable degree addressed to dictionary compilers and linguists in general.

S	Allan, K		Capone, A; Mey, JL		Allan, Keith			A Benchmark for Politeness	INTERDISCIPLINARY STUDIES IN PRAGMATICS CULTURE AND SOCIETY	Perspectives in Pragmatics Philosophy and Psychology		English	Article; Book Chapter						Appropriate behaviour; Cooperativeness; Face; Habitus; Impoliteness; Politeness; Rapport management; Social identity; Social interaction	IMPOLITENESS; FACE; PREFERENCE; LANGUAGE; STUDENTS; POWER	(Im)politeness is never a depersonalized, decontextualized absolute but always a perception or judgement of appropriate behaviour on a given occasion-what one expects oneself and others to do in a particular social interaction. Nevertheless, it is normal for most tabooed words and phrases to be castigated in dictionaries as dysphemistic (having connotations that are offensive either about the denotatum and/or to people addressed or overhearing the utterance). For example, in a range of dictionaries, shit is judged 'coarse', 'obscene', 'insulting', 'vulgar', 'profane', 'taboo', 'impolite', and 'offensive'. No rationale is given for any of these ex cathedra value judgements in the dictionaries, nor in media outlets, but a middleclass politeness criterion (MCPC) was proposed in Allan and Burridge, Euphemism and Dysphemism: Language Used as Shield and Weapon. (New York: Oxford University Press, pp. 21, 31, 1991): In order to be polite to a casual acquaintance of the opposite sex in a formal situation in a middle- class environment, one would normally be expected to use the euphemism or orthophemism rather than the dispreferred counterpart. The dispreferred counterpart would be a dysphemism. Orthophemisms (straight talking) and euphemisms (sweet talking) are words or phrases used as an alternative to a dispreferred (undesirable, inappropriate) expression because they avoid possible loss of face by the speaker and also the hearer or some third party. An orthophemism is typically more formal and more direct (or literal) than the corresponding more colloquial and figurative euphemism. There is no suggestion that the MCPC fails to apply between, say, close acquaintances of the same sex or any other dyad; however, language exchange between casual acquaintances of different sexes offers the most probable default conditions for the MCPC and, in this chapter, I claim that, with some slight adjustment, the MCPC offers a benchmark for politeness within Anglo communities. Following a discussion of (im) politeness theories and hypotheses about face management, (cultural) scripts, and habitus, the MCPC is closely examined, explained, and tested in the course of examining some texts. This chapter concludes with proposals to resolve the apparent limitations of the MCPC.

J	Monnier, S; Sperber, M				Monnier, Stefan; Sperber, Michael			Evolution of Emacs Lisp	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACM ON PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES-PACMPL			English	Article						History of programming languages; Lisp; Emacs Lisp		While Emacs proponents largely agree that it is the world's greatest text editor, it is almost as much a Lisp machine disguised as an editor. Indeed, one of its chief appeals is that it is programmable via its own programming language. Emacs Lisp is a Lisp in the classic tradition. In this article, we present the history of this language over its more than 30 years of evolution. Its core has remained remarkably stable since its inception in 1985, in large part to preserve compatibility with the many third-party packages providing a multitude of extensions. Still, Emacs Lisp has evolved and continues to do so. Important aspects of Emacs Lisp have been shaped by concrete requirements of the editor it supports as well as implementation constraints. These requirements led to the choice of a Lisp dialect as Emacs's language in the first place, specifically its simplicity and dynamic nature: Loading additional Emacs packages or changing the ones in place occurs frequently, and having to restart the editor in order to re-compile or re-link the code would be unacceptable. Fulfilling this requirement in a more static language would have been difficult at best. One of Lisp's chief characteristics is its malleability through its uniform syntax and the use of macros. This has allowed the language to evolve much more rapidly and substantively than the evolution of its core would suggest, by letting Emacs packages provide new surface syntax alongside new functions. In particular, Emacs Lisp can be customized to look much like Common Lisp, and additional packages provide multiple-dispatch object systems, legible regular expressions, programmable pattern-matching constructs, generalized variables, and more. Still, the core has also evolved, albeit slowly. Most notably, it acquired support for lexical scoping. The timeline of Emacs Lisp development is closely tied to the projects and people who have shaped it over the years: We document Emacs Lisp history through its predecessors, Mocklisp and MacLisp, its early development up to the "macs schismz"and the fork of Lucid Emacs, the development of XEmacs, and the subsequent rennaissance of Emacs development.

The aim of this paper was to examine pain-related tweets in Ireland over a 2-week period from 22 June 2017 to 5 July 2017 using pain-related keywords. We wished to identify Twitter user gender profile; most common discussion topics; sentiment analysis; and dissemination of tweets. Methods A third-party data analytics company conducted a Twitter social media analysis over a randomly chosen 14-day period between the dates 22 June and 5 July 2017. All relevant keywords were included in the search. Author group consensus yielded 24 terms. Geographical location was restricted to Ireland. A computational sentiment dictionary was used to provide a rating of the emotional properties of the text on a 9-point scale from -5 to +4 of negative to positive sentiment. Dissemination was calculated by the number of times the tweet was displayed ('impressions'). Results There were 941 tweets identified during the study from 715 contributors. These generated 2.88 million impressions. The most frequently occurring keywords were headache (n=321); migraine (n=147); back pain (n=123); cannabis (n=114); and chronic pain (n=85). There were 1.94 times as many tweets from females as males. The highest proportion of tweets from female users was in the fibromyalgia (83%) and migraine (60%) categories; and from males in the sciatica (35%), chronic pain (34%) and back pain (32%) categories. Cannabis-related tweets reflected mostly non-personal content (90%), with a highly positive sentiment, and the highest number of impressions per tweet. The largest amount of advice was offered in the back pain category. Reposting of other users' content ('retweets') was more likely to contain a positive sentiment. Conclusion A substantial discussion of pain-related topics took place on Twitter during our study period. This provided real-time, dynamic information from individuals on discussion topics in pain medicine. This can be used to gain a greater understanding of the pain experience. As patients are increasingly acquiring healthcare information through online sources, high-quality information from approved sources should be promoted on such platforms.

They require end users to perform: (1) checksum comparison to detect traditional data-based man-in-the-middle (data MITM) attacks, and, optionally, (2) speaker verification to detect sophisticated voice-based man-in-the-middle (voice MITM) attacks. However, research shows that both tasks are prone to human errors making Crypto Phones highly vulnerable to MITM attacks, especially to data MITM given the prominence of these attacks. Further, human errors under benign settings undermine usability since legitimate calls would often need to be rejected. We introduce Closed Captioning Crypto Phones (CCCP), that remove the human user from the loop of checksum comparison by utilizing speech transcription. CCCP simply requires the user to announce the checksum to the other party-the system automatically transcribes the spoken checksum and performs the comparison. Automating checksum comparisons offers many key advantages over traditional designs: (1) the chances of data MITM due to human errors and "click-through" could be highly reduced (even eliminated); (2) longer checksums can be utilized, which increases the protocol security against data MITM; (3) users' cognitive burden is reduced due to the need to perform only a single task, thereby lowering the potential of human errors. As a main component of CCCP, we first design and implement an automated checksum comparison tool based on standard Speech to Text engines. To evaluate the security and usability benefits of CCCP, we then design and conduct an online user study that mimics a realistic VoIP scenario, and collect and transcribe a comprehensive data set spoken by a wide variety of speakers in real-life conditions. Our study results demonstrate that, by using our automated checksum comparison, CCCP can completely resist data MITM, while significantly reducing human errors in the benign case compared to the traditional approach. They also show that CCCP may help reduce the likelihood of voice MITM. Finally, we discuss how CCCP can be improved by designing specialized transcribers and carefully selected checksum dictionaries, and how it can be integrated with existing Crypto Phones to bolster their security and usability.

Current standard implementation of cryptography is proved to require high resource in memory which is not suitable to be implemented in low memory embedded system, thus a lightweight cryptography are required. Vigenere cipher is one of the encryption algorithms that was easy to implement and comprehand, which can be used to provide confidentiality from the third party. Vigenere cipher is a polyalphabetic Ceaser cipher, which means it shifting the character in plaintext to become character of mod of its key character. Even thou Vigenere cipher are a classical cipher that doing its cipher using character compared to modern cipher that doing its cipher using bits and byte, it still can be implemented in modern computer by representing its character based on ASCII Table. Furthermore, because of this, its character can be extended to contain all alphabet and special character in the ASCII Table, thus allowing it to encrypt every character that can be represented using ASCII Table. Originally the resilience of Vigenere cipher is based on two factors: (1) the length of its key, and (2) the randomness of character in its key. Even though increasing the length and the used random character provide a great resilience, it takes away the fun of using dictionary word to encrypt the plaintext. To overcome that, this paper, proposing a method of implementing a Pseudorandom Path that change the flow of mod use by the Vigenere Cipher to encrypt and decrypt either positive mod or negative mod. Usually Vigenere Cipher use positive mode to encrypt, while negative mod to decrypt, however this paper propose a method to combine both mod during encryption or decryption with the supervision from the Pseudorandom Path. This method of implementation and its result were discussed in this paper and named as Shalala Cryptography. The results were compared between using original resilience and a Shalala Cryptography method. The resource requirement to implement this algorithm using C++ language is also shown, which shows a lightweight cryptography scheme in term of RAM consumption and fast processed time, which are suitable to be used in WSN or IoT environment.

J	Ibrahim, M; Gauch, S; Salman, O; Alqahtani, M				Ibrahim, Mohammed; Gauch, Susan; Salman, Omar; Alqahtani, Mohammed			An automated method to enrich consumer health vocabularies using GloVe word embeddings and an auxiliary lexical resource	PEERJ COMPUTER SCIENCE			English	Article						Ontologies; Consumer health vocabulary; Vocabulary enrichment; Word embedding	ONTOLOGY; PATIENT; SYSTEM	Background: Clear language makes communication easier between any two parties. A layman may have difficulty communicating with a professional due to not understanding the specialized terms common to the domain. In healthcare, it is rare to find a layman knowledgeable in medical terminology which can lead to poor understanding of their condition and/or treatment. To bridge this gap, several professional vocabularies and ontologies have been created to map laymen medical terms to professional medical terms and vice versa. Objective: Many of the presented vocabularies are built manually or semi-automatically requiring large investments of time and human effort and consequently the slow growth of these vocabularies. In this paper, we present an automatic method to enrich laymen's vocabularies that has the benefit of being able to be applied to vocabularies in any domain. Methods: Our entirely automatic approach uses machine learning, specifically Global Vectors for Word Embeddings (GloVe), on a corpus collected from a social media healthcare platform to extend and enhance consumer health vocabularies. Our approach further improves the consumer health vocabularies by incorporating synonyms and hyponyms from the WordNet ontology. The basic GloVe and our novel algorithms incorporating WordNet were evaluated using two laymen datasets from the National Library of Medicine (NLM), Open-Access Consumer Health Vocabulary (OAC CHV) and MedlinePlus Healthcare Vocabulary. Results: The results show that GloVe was able to find new laymen terms with an F-score of 48.44%. Furthermore, our enhanced GloVe approach outperformed basic GloVe with an average F-score of 61%, a relative improvement of 25%. Furthermore, the enhanced GloVe showed a statistical significance over the two ground truth datasets with P < 0.001. Conclusions: This paper presents an automatic approach to enrich consumer health vocabularies using the GloVe word embeddings and an auxiliary lexical source, WordNet. Our approach was evaluated used healthcare text downloaded from MedHelp.org, a healthcare social media platform using two standard laymen vocabularies, OAC CHV, and MedlinePlus. We used the WordNet ontology to expand the healthcare corpus by including synonyms, hyponyms, and hypernyms for each layman term occurrence in the corpus. Given a seed term selected from a concept in the ontology, we measured our algorithms' ability to automatically extract synonyms for those terms that appeared in the ground truth concept. We found that enhanced GloVe outperformed GloVe with a relative improvement of 25% in the F-score.

Combating the challenges of social media hate speech in a polarized society A Twitter ego lexalytics approach	DATA TECHNOLOGIES AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Social media; Twitter; Sentiment analysis; Hate speech; Lexalytics; POSA	SENTIMENT ANALYSIS; ONTOLOGY; WEB	Purpose Hate speech in recent times has become a troubling development. It has different meanings to different people in different cultures. The anonymity and ubiquity of the social media provides a breeding ground for hate speech and makes combating it seems like a lost battle. However, what may constitute a hate speech in a cultural or religious neutral society may not be perceived as such in a polarized multi-cultural and multi-religious society like Nigeria. Defining hate speech, therefore, may be contextual. Hate speech in Nigeria may be perceived along ethnic, religious and political boundaries. The purpose of this paper is to check for the presence of hate speech in social media platforms like Twitter, and to what degree is hate speech permissible, if available? It also intends to find out what monitoring mechanisms the social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter have put in place to combat hate speech. Lexalytics is a term coined by the authors from the words lexical analytics for the purpose of opinion mining unstructured texts like tweets. Design/methodology/approach This research developed a Python software called polarized opinions sentiment analyzer (POSA), adopting an ego social network analytics technique in which an individual's behavior is mined and described. POSA uses a customized Python N-Gram dictionary of local context-based terms that may be considered as hate terms. It then applied the Twitter API to stream tweets from popular and trending Nigerian Twitter handles in politics, ethnicity, religion, social activism, racism, etc., and filtered the tweets against the custom dictionary using unsupervised classification of the texts as either positive or negative sentiments. The outcome is visualized using tables, pie charts and word clouds. A similar implementation was also carried out using R-Studio codes and both results are compared and a t-test was applied to determine if there was a significant difference in the results. The research methodology can be classified as both qualitative and quantitative. Qualitative in terms of data classification, and quantitative in terms of being able to identify the results as either negative or positive from the computation of text to vector. Findings The findings from two sets of experiments on POSA and R are as follows: in the first experiment, the POSA software found that the Twitter handles analyzed contained between 33 and 55 percent hate contents, while the R results show hate contents ranging from 38 to 62 percent. Performing a t-test on both positive and negative scores for both POSA and R-studio, results reveal p-values of 0.389 and 0.289, respectively, on an alpha value of 0.05, implying that there is no significant difference in the results from POSA and R. During the second experiment performed on 11 local handles with 1,207 tweets, the authors deduce as follows: that the percentage of hate contents classified by POSA is 40 percent, while the percentage of hate contents classified by R is 51 percent. That the accuracy of hate speech classification predicted by POSA is 87 percent, while free speech is 86 percent. And the accuracy of hate speech classification predicted by R is 65 percent, while free speech is 74 percent. This study reveals that neither Twitter nor Facebook has an automated monitoring system for hate speech, and no benchmark is set to decide the level of hate contents allowed in a text. The monitoring is rather done by humans whose assessment is usually subjective and sometimes inconsistent. Social implications This study will help to promote a more positive society, ensuring the social media is positively utilized to the benefit of mankind. Originality/value The findings can be used by social media companies to monitor user behaviors, and pin hate crimes to specific persons. Governments and law enforcement bodies can also use the POSA application to track down hate peddlers.

S	Lodej, S		Markus, M; Iyeiri, Y; Heuberger, R; Chamson, E		Lodej, Sylwester			Concept-driven semasiology and onomasiology of CLERGY Focus on the lexicogenesis of pope, bishop and priest	MIDDLE AND MODERN ENGLISH CORPUS LINGUISTICS: A MULTI-DIMENSIONAL APPROACH	Studies in Corpus Linguistics		English	Article; Book Chapter								The semantic and morphological activities of the terms pope, bishop and priest show uneven distribution in time. The Oxford English Dictionary (OED) dating of the first occurrences of semasiological and onomasiological developments related to these terms points to their increased activity in the period 1550-1700. This paper aims to explain the motivation of these processes, viewing them in the context of historical developments. The corpus consists of comic drama texts available from the Literature Online (LION) database. The relevant texts give evidence that semasiology and onomasiology overlap, being governed by the same patterns of motivation. The linguistic processes accounted for in the article are closely related to the social and political events of the post-Reformation period in England.

J	Kazakevich, OA; Starikova, GN				Kazakevich, O. A.; Starikova, G. N.			From Siberia to China: Ways and Means of Localising Movement in an Unfamiliar Environment (Based on the State Report of Fyodor Baykov)	VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA FILOLOGIYA-TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF PHILOLOGY			Russian	Article						state report; ambassador's report; China; 17th century; means and methods of nomination; route description		The article explores the description of the road from Tobolsk to China, presented in the report of 1657-58 by the Russian envoy Fyodor Baykov, whose task was to scout out a convenient and safe route to the neighbouring southeastern country. This medieval genre of business writing, which affirms the formation and development of Russian diplomacy, is called a state report (stateynyy spisok). The markers of the novelty of the environment and the initial familiarisation with its objects in the text of the article list are 1) direct indications of the unknown, inaccuracy of information: Irtysh <...> vver'kh poshel v rozsyp' <...> a pro to podlinno nevedomo, iz kakikh mest poshel (B1: 120); 2) a reference to the need of obtaining information from third parties: A vedena de to stena iz-za Sukcheya goroda za Kitayskoye tsar'stvo do morya. A skazyvali pro to bukhartsy, i kalmyki, i kitaytsy (B2: 111-112); 3) the lack of fluency of Russian culture representatives in foreign-language nominative means, which is expressed in their translation, interpretation (a kap vesom po pudu - B2: 74 rev.), regular formal variations (lama - laba, mugaly - mungaly), most commonly in proper nouns (Karbuha - Karbuhay), and so on. The analysis shows that the description of the road includes references to 1) route points (initial, final, and intermediate) with the designation of their characteristics and/or clarification of their location, or without them; 2) the distance between the control points of the route; 3) the very fact of movement, its method, direction, place of movement, and its conditions. The sources demonstrate the dependence between the nomination models and their lexical expression, and the type of the described object. For instance, when settlements are presented, the material of buildings (kirpichnyy, glinyanyy, derevyannyy), location (mezh gor v nizkom meste), river source and mouth locations, the nature of the water, the presence of fish, etc. are regularly described. When presenting new lands with the help of particularly structured linguistic means, Baykov uses an already familiar cultural code of the nomination. This is expressed, firstly, in a significant number of comparison constructions (A pashni u nikh po-russki - B1: 124; a dni pered nashimi vdvoe - B1: 123) and correspondence constructions (A lan ikh vesu 10 zolotnikov, a ruskogo vesu 9 zolotnikov - B2: 110); secondly, in specific cases of characterisations of the definition of space and its objects by negation - through signs of the absence of something: A itti vse step' pustaya, lesu i vody net i ulusov kalmytskikh net zhe (B1: 116); a gde gor net, v takikh mestekh i lesu net, krome tovolozhnika da karagal'nika, i vodoyu skudno (B2: 73 rev.).

CURRENT METHODOLOGIES AND TEACHING MODALS TO RUSSIAN LEARNERS	EDULEARN18: 10TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON EDUCATION AND NEW LEARNING TECHNOLOGIES	EDULEARN Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	10th International Conference on Education and New Learning Technologies (EDULEARN)	JUL 02-04, 2018	Palma, SPAIN			modal verbs; modality; language consciousness; theory of step-by-step formation of mental actions; consciousness-raising		The article is aimed at demonstrating the importance of the concept of raising language consciousness in teaching English to Russian learners. The research is based on the material of modal verbs the use of which becomes a stumbling block for Russian learners as they are not conscious of the fundamental differences between the systems of expressing modality in Russian and in English. An attempt is made to show what advantages can the theory of step-by-step formation of mental actions offer to learners when applied to the process of acquiring a foreign language. In teaching authentic English it would be natural to turn to textbooks and manuals written by native speakers and specially meant for foreign learners. At present there are a lot of textbooks of that kind which are widely used for teaching English to Russian students. These textbooks are usually of very good quality, being written by highly skilled educationalists and experts in the field of methods of teaching. However, in our opinion, the trouble is that all these textbooks have a number of drawbacks. First of all, they are meant for hours and hours of work, both in classroom and at home-which is not the case for most Russian schools and universities. Still more important, these teaching manuals are meant for foreigners at large, without focusing on the peculiar characteristics of the learners' native language. They can be taken up by people from Japan, Poland or Italy, and the result would presumably be the same. This means that they present genuine English material, without any reference to the learners' mother tongue. But it is a well-established fact both in psychology and in linguistics that "thinking is cast in the moulds of the mother tongue". Most people who have had any experience of studying foreign languages tend to agree that the most difficult thing about learning a foreign language is acquiring or assimilating ways of thinking which are quite natural for native speakers of a foreign language but are alien to our own one. That is why in teaching English we have to consistently refer to the Russian language, bringing out similarities and dissimilarities between the two. This can help counteract the effects of interference of students' mother tongue and make it easier for them to concentrate on lexical and grammatical items which tend to challenge Russian speakers. So far no unanimous agreement has been reached as far as the concept of consciousness-raising teaching of foreign languages is concerned. On the one hand, there are staunch supporters of the idea, convinced that this approach fully complies with the current theories on how learners master a foreign language. On the other hand, there are tough opponents of this method, who insist on the idea that teaching should adhere to a more conventional, "naturalistic" approach, relying on "learning by doing" technique which would trigger the mechanisms of language acquisition. Yet, the debates that are going on between the two parties give reasonable hope that language consciousness-raising will take its proper place in language teaching methodology and an in-depth analysis of psychological and psycholinguistic mechanisms will be provided. The authors arrive at the conclusion that raising English language consciousness which lies at the root of this theory facilitates the process of efficient language learning.

J	Schmid, N; Guinaudeau, B				Schmid, Nicolas; Guinaudeau, Benjamin			Mapping public support for climate solutions in France	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						sustainability transitions; France; climate policy; mass politics; public opinion; structural topic modelling; energy and transport	CHANGE POLICY; INNOVATION; CITIZENS; SUSTAINABILITY; POLITICS; WORK	Although successful sustainability transitions depend on public support, we still know little about citizens' opinions on climate solutions. Existing research often focuses on the problem perception of climate change rather than analyzing attitudes toward specific climate solutions. Studies also largely use closed questions to assess public opinion, posing a problem of ecological validity. Here, we address these gaps by leveraging data from a large-scale public consultation process, the "Grand Debat National", launched by the French government in response to the Yellow Vest movement in 2019. Combining structural topic modelling, dictionary-based text analysis and qualitative coding, we map the salience and directionality of public opinion on climate solutions. We find that consultation participants perceive climate change as the most salient environmental problem. Transforming the transport and energy sectors is the most supported solution for addressing climate change. For these two sectors, substitution-based climate solutions - as opposed to sufficiency- or efficiency-based measures - are most salient. For instance, participants stress the need to expand public transport infrastructure and switch to renewable energy technologies for power generation. Our findings demonstrate a strong public consensus on most substitution-based climate solutions, except for the role of cars and nuclear energy. While most participants do not link climate solutions to specific policy instruments, we find preferences for authority-based instruments in the context of phasing out polluting technologies, and treasury-based instruments for supporting innovation and phasing in low carbon technologies.

There is a large spectrum of possible NLP applications which aid in automating tasks like text translation amongst languages, retrieving and summarizing data from very huge and complex repositories, spam email filtering, identifying fake news in digital media, finding political opinions, views and sentiments of people on various government policies, providing effective medical assistance based on past history records of patients etc. Gujarati language is an Indian language with more than sixty million users worldwide. At present, many efforts are laid for developing NLP applications and resources for Indian languages. This survey gives a taxonomy and comprehensive report regarding component and resource development for Gujarati NLP systems. Also, few prominent tools available in open domain are tested, and their posterior analysis is presented. Possible measures to handle the issues in resource and component development of Gujarati NLP system are also discussed. This report might be useful for industry, researchers and academicians to have a clear picture of the research gaps, challenges and opportunities in Gujarati NLP systems.

J	Malambe, GB; Harford, C				Malambe, Gloria B.; Harford, Carolyn			Raising the profile of siSwati as a national language	JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY AFRICAN STUDIES			English	Article; Early Access						siSwati; Eswatini; language equity; indigenous languages; bilingualism; corpus linguistics	AFRICAN LANGUAGES; POLICY; POLITICS	The governing framework and national ethos of the Kingdom of Eswatini are grounded in the traditional culture of emaSwati (the people of Eswatini) and their language, siSwati. At the same time, economic success is tied to knowledge of English, the former colonial language of Eswatini, which is the language of government, the media, the judiciary and formal education. One outcome of this type of bilingualism is the relative marginalisation of large numbers of citizens whose command of English is limited. While siSwati remains alive through its use by emaSwati, there are concerns that, in the long term, the dominance of English in key domains could pose a threat to the survival of siSwati. This concern is reflected in the recent creation of a SiSwati Language Board by the Government of Eswatini. Drawing on research that suggests that inclusivity and language maintenance are linked, this paper proposes that the prestige of siSwati be enhanced within the English-based globally-oriented sector of emaSwati society through activities undertaken by the SiSwati Language Board, such as a project to produce a tagged digital corpus of siSwati texts from a wide variety of genres and a monolingual dictionary based on this corpus, parallel to the construction of such corpora by the ALLEX project at the University of Zimbabwe, as well as encouraging the expansion of siSwati into new genres as well. Such activities could contribute to raising the profile of siSwati as a language that merits the same study and attention afforded to more prestigious languages such as English.

J	Ashir, AM				Ashir, Abubakar M.			A Generalized Method for Sentiment Analysis across Different Sources	APPLIED COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND SOFT COMPUTING			English	Article								Sentiment analysis is widely used in a variety of applications such as online opinion gathering for policy directives in government, monitoring of customers, and staff satisfactions in corporate bodies, in politics and security structures for public tension monitoring, and so on. In recent times, the field met with new set of challenges where new algorithms have to contend with highly unstructured sources for sentiment expressions emanating from online social media fora. In this study, a rule and lexical-based procedure is proposed together with unsupervised machine learning to implement sentiment analysis with an improved generalization ability across different sources. To deal with sources devoid of syntactic and grammatical structure, the approach incorporates a ruled-based technique for emoticon detection, word contraction expansion, noise removal, and lexicon-based text preprocessing using lexical features such as part of speech (POS), stop words, and lemmatization for local context analysis. A text is broken into number of tokens with each representing a sentence and then lexicon-dependent features are extracted from each token. The features are merged together using a combining function for a given text before being used to train a machine learning classifier. The proposed combining functions leverage on averaging and information gain concepts. Experimental results with different machine leaning classifiers indicate that improved performance with great deal of generalization capacity across both structured and nonstructured sources can be realized. The finding shows that carefully designed lexical features reinforce learning process in unsupervised learning more than using word embeddings alone as the features. Obtained experimental results from movie review dataset (recall = 74.9%, precision = 70.9%, F1-score = 72.9%, and accuracy = 72.0%) and twitter samples' datasets (recall = 93.4%, precision = 89.5%, F1-score = 91.4%, and accuracy = 91.1%) show the efficacy of the proposed approach in comparison with other state-of-the-art research studies.

J	Feng, GL; Feng, Y				Feng, Geng Liang; Feng, Yue			On Yen Fuh's Compatible Attitude towards Christianity Seen from His Translation and Social Intercourse	SINO-CHRISTIAN STUDIES			Chinese	Article						Yen Fuh; translation; Christianity; missionaries		Although there have been a lot of research on Yen Fuh, his compatible or friendly attitude towards Christianity is rarely mentioned, which can actually be seen from his translations and social intercourse. Yen was born into a traditional scholarly family and he was interested in the art of governing the country. Living in the Qing-dynasty cultural surrounding frequented by anti-Christianity cases, he still had bowing acquaintance with missionaries and was deeply influenced by their thought. Yen's eight great translated books, which brought him fame as a translator, played an important role in the transcending of Chinese society. This article illustrates Yen's comments and notes in his translated books in which can be sensed a strong momentum to disseminate Christian thought as a channel of his political participation through translation. Through his translated books, Yen intended to improve the morality of Chinese people, to enhance the rule of law and civil rights and to disseminate western thought in China. In doing translation, Yen used Chinese supernatural dictions, rather than transliteration or coinages, to translate Christian supernatural ones. And he adopted the approach of domestication by using elegant literary quotations instead of foreignization to translate biblical allusions. Besides, Yen made a point of the educational value of Christianity and he reconstructed missionaries' occasional negative image in his translation by rewriting the source text so that they could be well liked. Yen's was sincere in his feelings, instead of being diplomatic, and his translation approaches were in tune with his sentiments. Therefore, his translated works all reveal his friendly attitude towards Christianity.

J	Skovorodnikov, AP; Kopnina, GA				Skovorodnikov, Alexander P.; Kopnina, Galina A.			On the Conception of the Modern Political Labels Dictionary	VOPROSY LEKSIKOGRAFII-RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF LEXICOGRAPHY			Russian	Article						political lexicography; political labels dictionary; political lexicon; verbal label		The article aims to describe the conception of the Modern Political Labels Dictionary being developed at the Siberian Federal University. The creation of such a dictionary is relevant owing to the development of political lexicography which allows revealing the state and features of modern political language development. It is also noted that political labels remain largely unstudied despite their wide and quite long-term use in media. The authors of both the dictionary and the article believe that it can be useful not only for specialists focused on conducting linguistic examinations of conflictogenic texts, but also for those who are interested in politics. The Modern Political Labels Dictionary makers see the main purpose of its creation in characterizing modern political discourse verbal labels used as a tool of information-psychological confrontation as completely as possible. The concept of the dictionary is based on the following definition of the term "political verbal label": it is a nominative ideologeme (word and phrase) tending to stereotypization. It is a linear negative myth used to discredit socially and politically significant objects. A political verbal label is characterized by exaggerated pejorative connotations and weakened denotative components. The dictionary being developed is explanatory and illustrative. It also includes derivations and (optional) philological commentaries. The selection of speech samples for the dictionary was mainly based on a linguo-ideological analysis following the methodology proposed by N.A. Kupina that assumes the identification of key ideologeme labels in a text and analysis of their compatibility to reveal semantic, axiological, and aesthetic additives that reflect an author's point of view on certain political events. The article also characterizes the dictionary structure including a theoretical introduction, dictionary entries, a glossary, and a list of abbreviations; examples of dictionary entries are provided. The words and phrases selected for the glossary passed verification procedure acting as Yandex, Google and Russian Language National Corpus search query to confirm their non-unity (usability): the existence of at least 3 to 5 contexts from different sources in which the selected unit is used with the same meaning was considered sufficient. It is noted in the description of a dictionary entry that it contains both mandatory (head unit; interpretation of its semantics in compliance with the principle of unification of interpretation models; speech samples from texts of various styles and genres created in post-Soviet and modern periods) and optional (commentaries on the functioning specifics of a political label: its origin, use periods, productivity and role in text; variations; synonyms and derivatives) components. It is concluded that the work on the dictionary made it possible to clarify the definition of the political labels phenomenon; identify the most common political labels, and expand the notion of their paradigmatic (synonymous, opposing) connections, word-formation capabilities, functioning specifics in modern public speech; and present the meta-reactions of society to their use. The above-mentioned makes it possible to fill the current gap in the theory of political linguistics.

The SWAMP Metaphor in Characteristics of Society	TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL			Russian	Article						ethnolinguistics; semantics; phraseology; swamp; social environment		The article deals with the semantics of the word swamp, which can characterize the state of human society. The study is relevant due to the wide usage of such phrases as social swamp, provincial swamp, Moscow life swamp, etc. in the modern literary language. The novelty of the study is determined by the fact that currently there is no experience in a systemic interpretation of the social semantics of the word swamp. The authors have used definitional, semantic, and contextual analyses as well as lexicographic modeling. They analyzed lexical entries that helped to discover peculiarities of a lexicographic fixation of the data on the analyzed word's meaning. It has been revealed that the Old Russian dictionaries from the 12th till the late 15th centuries featured only the direct geographical meaning of the words blato and boloto ('swamp'). The use of the church Slavonicism blato meaning the moral concept of sinfulness, immorality, i.e. 'moral filth', was typical of the church-theological discourse of the 17th century, whereas the texts frequently displayed the opposition zlato ('gold') - blato ('swamp'). The first contexts where boloto ('swamp') was used to name the undesirable social environment, in which a person found themselves, were recorded in the 18th century. After that the swamp social semantics was extensively developed. The anthropological semantics of this word family managed to develop because of the base that already existed in Russian common dialects. Folk speech reveals the sources of two derivational vectors in the swamp word family: (1) 'bog, wild hard-to-reach place' > 'backwater, boondocks, remote from large centers of social life'; (2) 'locus with its inhabitants' > 'homeland'. Other European languages show similar tendencies for the swamp identification. Particularly, in German the word Sumpf ('swamp') is a part of phrases with the inner form 'go down into the swamp', meaning transition to a lower social class and moral decline. Apparently, the social evaluativity of the word swamp in the Russian literary language developed under the influence of the European languages, German in particular (via the translated literature of the post-Petrine era). Analysis of the contexts found in the Russian National Corpus helped to discover that the geographical (landscape) term swamp had developed the fanciest secondary semantics of the anthropocentric nature in the book-written tradition. The swamp metaphor is used to characterize (1) provincial backcountry, (2) lesser homeland, (3) stagnation of social and political life, (4) a society with moral perversion, (5) a group of people ruled by intrigues and dishonest methods of competition, (6) daily routine of a family. Thus, while enriching itself with new evaluative meanings and connotations embodied in phrases, in the 18th century the swamp concept gained (under the influence of European literary languages) social connotations that became stronger and more detailed in contexts of the writers and publicists of the 19th and 20th centuries.

By reconceptualising affectivity beyond emotive storytelling, intentional stance-taking or evaluative expression, we propose a methodology that highlights how conventions related to mediating, modulating and managing affectivity permeate journalistic genres. Drawing from conversation analysis, Bakhtinian theory of language as dialogical and notion of affective meaning-making, we investigate how selected linguistic forms and structures - namely evidential and epistemic modals and lexical items signalling affective intensity (such as emotive and evaluative words and metaphorical expressions) - participate in affective meaning-making in news journalism. A scalable computational methodology is introduced to study multiple linguistic structures in conjunction. In investigating a case study - the news reporting and commentary on a highly charged, year-long political conflict between the right-wing conservative government and the trade unions in Finland (2015-2016) - the approach allows a focus on the ways in which affectivity operates in journalistic texts in response to both generic expectations of the audience and journalistic conventions. Our findings include identification of the intertwining of strategic rituals of objectivity and emotionality, recognition of metaphoricity as a key source of affectivity and detection of different news article types having their own conventions for managing affectivity. We also observe a connection between emotive and evaluative words and the grammatical constructions used to express degrees of certainty, which suggests these modal constructions play an important part in how affectivity informs journalistic texts.

J	Alujevic, M; Plavsa, MB				Alujevic, Marijana; Plavsa, Mira Braovic			THE EFFECT OF PSYCHOTYPOLOGY AND LINGUISTIC ATTITUDES TOWARDS TARGET LANGUAGE ON THE OCCURRENCE OF TRANSFER ON THE RECEPTIVE LEVEL UPON THE FIRST CONTACT OF CROATIAN SPEAKERS WITH ITALIAN AS	FOLIA LINGUISTICA ET LITTERARIA			Italian	Article						transfer; reception; vocabulary; psychotypology; linguistic attitude		Psychotypology is one of the conditions for the occurrence of cross-linguistic influences. Following empirical findings, we conducted a study to establish the presence and the effect of psychotypology on the language transfer between Italian, as a foreign language, and the local speech of Split, as a variant of learners' L1. Two target groups with no prior knowledge of Italian were questioned: one hundred students regularly in contact with the speech of Split and another hundred with no competence and no contact with it. The two groups took the Yes/No Vocabulary test. The aim was to reveal the initial comprehension of Italian vocabulary. Through the questionnaire, we gained insight into the intuitive behaviour of both groups of participants regarding the meaning of given Italian words, distance perceived, and subjective perception of the relationship between the Italian language and the speech of Split. The results of the two groups were compared using the quantitative test data. In addition, the relationship between psychotypology and a successful test outcome was thoroughly examined, according to the qualitative data. The results demonstrated an extremely high percentage of informants in both groups being aware of similarities between the two idioms at the lexical level. The findings indicated that participants who perceived the similarities as significant performed better on the test. The analysis of results showed that the experimental group found the Italian language easily comprehensible, whereas the control group defined it as somewhat demanding. Significantly better vocabulary test results of the experimental group confirmed that participant's attitude is essential to achieve language transfer. Over the last two decades, the study of cross-linguistic influences has moved its focus from the positive and negative interference of the mother tongue to the language being learned and vice versa to the multidirectional influences of all available language systems to which a learner is subjected. Lately, researchers are concerned with a wide range of new sociolinguistic and psycholinguistic issues, focusing mainly on the mental lexicon. Numerous studies have been conducted on different linguistic levels and on different relationships and combinations of languages, including the influence of other languages one learns on top of the mother tongue. Recently there has been an increase in studies on lexical transfer, but still fewer than in studies considering cross-linguistic influences at the level of syntax. The impact of individual factors on the outcome of the language transfer is also analysed. A substantial number of empirical studies proves the usefulness and importance of the research on language transfer at the receptive levels and on psychotypology as its major determinant. Still, little research has been done on the role of related words and psychotypology within the context of Croatian speakers learning a foreign language. The attitude towards a foreign language and the motivation to learn it are factors related to the learner's personality mainly determined by his/her sociocultural environment. The learner's attitudes can be affected by the geographical area in which a person is brought up or lives since the stances that prevail in the area are usually those that one adopts. Therefore, the environment can define the learner's conceptual views of a specific culture, language, and people. This paper aims to verify how a positive attitude, due to close contact with the Italian culture and language for centuries, acts as a stimulus towards its learning. Even though Italian and Croatian belong to two different groups of languages, the long-lasting contact between them, conditioned by historical, political, cultural and economic circumstances, has determined forms of loanwords from the Italian language and has led to the development of similarities at the lexical and morphosyntactic level, which we intend to study and enhance under the language teaching aspect. The Split idiom considered in this paper abounds in words of Italian origin among which those of Venetian dialect predominate since they entered the dialects of the coastal regions as early as the 11th century when the area was for the first time under their government. The research presented in this paper is part of a broader and more systematic empirical study of cross-language influences, which aimed at determining the potential pedagogical effect of the lexical corpus of Italian origin that is an integral part of the Split idiom in the context of learning Italian as a foreign language. Since there is a limited number of available studies dealing with the influence of dialectal variants of the mother tongue on foreign language learning, those consulted in this paper mainly deal with the phonological aspect of this impact, emphasizing that it is more frequent and present in oral production. The aim of our research was to determine the kind of relationship between the phenomenon of linguistic transfer at the receptive level and the attitude towards the Italian language of the two groups of Croatian speakers. We also intended to analyse the so-called psychotypology, i.e. to what extent the transfer depends on the intuition and subjective perception of the learners on the proximity of the two systems, the local idiom of Split and the Italian language. The research hypothesis was that the transition from one language to another depends on students' intuition and the perception of differences or similarities between the languages. The motivation to acquire a foreign language, as another decisive factor, has been proved as proportional to a positive attitude towards it. Having all this in mind, we expected that the positive impact of related words on the understanding of the Italian ones would depend on the students' awareness of the correlated lexical relationship between the Italian language and the idiom of the Split region. One hundred high school students from Split who had no knowledge of Italian but were regularly exposed to the local idiom formed the experimental group. The control group consisted of students coming from the continental part of Croatia who, as well, did not have any previous knowledge of Italian. The distinction between the two groups was that the participants from the control group had weak knowledge of the Split idiom and were rarely exposed to it. Both groups were subjected to a vocabulary test designed to verify the initial understanding of one hundred Italian words. The vocabulary test was created according to the common model to measure lexical competence at the level of recognition and reception, i.e. the specially adapted and integrated Yes / No Vocabulary Test (Meara et al. 1987), which requires the participant to simply confirm or deny the understanding of the words from the target language. The words used in the vocabulary test were selected according to the highest level of their occurrence in texts written in the Split idiom. In the second part of the vocabulary test, students were asked to translate familiar words into their mother tongue to obtain more reliable results. The results of the vocabulary test of the experimental and control group were compared using quantitative data analysis. As assumed, the participants from Split were more successful in determining the meaning of the Italian words than those of the control group who speak dialects in which hardly any Italianisms are present. The third part of the test had a qualitative character as participants had to explain, based on their experiences, which procedures they used to deduce the meaning of words they did not know and strategies they implemented while searching for corresponding terms in their mother tongue. The questionnaire, to which the interviewees were subjected after completing the test, consisted of a series of questions that required the use of the metalanguage in order to provide information on their intuition and subjective perception of the similarities and differences of vocabulary between the Italian language and the Split idiom. The aim was to analyse their evaluation of the possible facilitating effect of knowledge of the characteristic words of the Split idiom and the attitude towards the Italian language. Participants had to clarify in the questionnaire how lexical similarity, if recognized, affected the understanding of the meaning and whether they consciously referred to it during the task. The qualitative results of the questionnaire provided information on how psychotypology and attitudes towards the language are related to success in taking the Yes / No Vocabulary test. The comments on the perceived similarity between the Italian words contained in the vocabulary test and the words of the Split idiom, i.e. lexical transparency between the two obtained by the questionnaire showed that an extremely high percentage of respondents in both groups noticed a similarity between the words of the two languages. As for the potentially facilitating effect of the Split idiom on the learning of the Italian language, the comparison showed no difference in the rating between the two groups since both recognized it as very effective. The students also had to express their attitude towards Italian using a four-level scale. The results showed that in the experimental group, the mean value was higher than the control one. Since the distributions of the answers to this question were statistically different from average, we used a nonparametric Mann-Whitney test. The results showed a noticeable difference. Since it has been scientifically proven that the probability of cross-language influence depends, among other things, on the interest and attitude of learners towards the foreign language studied, we expected that the experimental group, which proved to be more ready for lexical transfer, would show a more positive attitude towards the Italian language than the control group, but the results were different. Given that the positive attitude of the control group towards the Italian language is not accompanied by arguments of a linguistic or sociolinguistic nature, we can interpret that the participants perceived it as attractive because they associate it with music, art, gastronomy and Italian fashion. The following results illustrated the participants' perception of the so-called ease or difficulty in understanding Italian. The experimental group stated that the Italian language is easy to understand while the control group found it more difficult. A surprising finding that was revealed in the research is the negative correlation between the attitude towards the Italian language and the Split idiom in the control group. In other words, the more the respondents from the control group liked the Split idiom, the less they liked the Italian language and vice versa. The results revealed that both groups, experimental and control, are aware of the proximity and similarity between the Italian language and the local idiom of Split. The experimental group also identified similarity as a substantial factor in facilitating the learning of a foreign language. On the basis of precise assumptions of the meaning of Italian words in both groups, the subjective perception of the students stands out as an important factor. Analysing the results, we came to the conclusion that learning Italian for speakers of the Split idiom can become more meaningful and successful if the ability and independence of learners to notice similarities between the two languages is taken as a starting point. The research revealed that participants of the experimental group are not always able to detect the relationships and similarities when confronted with the specific examples in Italian, even though they are aware of the lexical proximity facilitating the comprehension of the Italian language. By highlighting lexical similarities, teachers can raise students' awareness of the potential sources of knowledge available, make them more approachable to students and facilitate the learning process. They should focus on systematic patterns and analogies, i.e. similarities between the mother tongue and the language taught. Teachers should also gradually develop learners' sensitivity to the concept of linguistic similarity. Finally, in the context of the Split regional idiom, the need to design and enrich the teaching materials in the initial phase of learning Italian as a foreign language imposes itself as a logical outcome of this research. Provided that teachers understand the advantages of applying this methodology, classroom activities should occasionally involve texts written in the Split idiom for the students to learn to recognize the lexical closeness of the two languages when present. It would inevitably affect the learners' attitude towards their mother tongue and towards Italian as a foreign language, which, as we have seen in the results, is not as favourable, or at least not as much as one would expect from those born and raised in Split. Our main goal is to emphasize the pedagogical usefulness of the local Split idiom as an effective tool in teaching Italian as a foreign language. Teachers should be encouraged to incorporate the contrasting of the two languages at the lexical level and promote tolerance and interest in the Split idiom instead of neglecting it in the teaching process. Finally, we encourage the use of teaching activities that include part of the lexical fund of the Split idiom, which will spur learners to make a cross-language comparison with some words from the lexical fund of the Italian language. It is advisable to exploit the advantage offered by transparency while controlling the risks of interference in production activities. By emphasizing the similarities and patterns between the mother tongue and the foreign language at the lexical level, the teacher spurs more opportunities for language transfer. Applying this method in teaching would help achieve a positive transfer of receptive skills and an awareness of the potential negative transfer.

Kornilov; "Kornilovites"; history of concepts; legitimizing of violence		The article examines the application of the concept of "civil war" during the Revolution of 1917. Attention is paid to the so-called "the Kornilov affair". We use different political dictionaries, periodicals, public appeals of main political actors, and diaries as our main sources. All political forces used the collocation "civil war", and they utilized the fear of civil war for their own purposes. The exceptions were some radical Socialists, primarily Vladimir Lenin, who, in some of his texts, described the revolution as a civil war that had already begun. On the eve of the Kornilov affair, some contemporaries assumed that the inevitable political crisis could take a form of a civil war. It is not surprising that the conflict between the Supreme Commander and the Provisional Government, which took the form of a confrontation between army formations, was characterized by people of different views as a civil war. This influenced the description of political opponents who at this stage were perceived as enemies. The Bolsheviks were not the only ones who considered it impossible to achieve any compromise with the "Kornilovites" and the "bourgeoisie". All this made it extremely difficult to create a new coalition government and limited the base of political support for Alexander Kerensky and other supporters of an agreement with the "bourgeoisie". The "Kornilov case" was an important stage of the "articulation" of the civil war. Subsequently, this created favorable conditions for the preparation of an armed uprising by the Bolsheviks, who used the new discursive situation of legitimizing violence that arose because of this crisis.

J	Kostogryzov, PI				Kostogryzov, P., I			SUPREME POWER: "FORGOTTEN" CATEGORY IN POLITICAL SCIENCE?	POLITEIA-JOURNAL OF POLITICAL THEORY POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY AND SOCIOLOGY OF POLITICS			Russian	Article						supreme power; sovereignty; sovereign; source of power; state studies; political theory		The article is devoted to the analysis of the concept of supreme power, which, according to the author, is undeservedly neglected by the modern Political Science. Despite the high importance of this concept, its definition is lacking in dictionaries, as well as most textbooks and reviews. Legal Science and State Studies have known this concept at least since the 16th century. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, due to the works of such scientists as Boris Chicherin, Alexander Alekseev, Nikolay Korkunov, Georg Jellinek, Lev Tikhomirov, Petr Kazansky the academic consensus was formed that supreme power can be defined as legally unlimited, complete and unconditional power in the state. At the beginning of the 21st century, the interest in this category has revived, which resulted, in particular, in the previous concepts becoming relevant again. After having critically analyzed the existing ideas of the Russian researchers on this topic, the author comes to the conclusion that elaboration of the relevant theory of the supreme power that lives up to the modern level of knowledge, requires interdisciplinary approach and combined effort from lawyers, political scientists, historians, and sociologists. Having convincingly demonstrated that today this task is still far from being complete, he focuses on a number of key problems for the development of such a theory and outlines possible directions for finding their solution. According to his conclusion, the category "supreme power" has a significant heuristic potential, and its "return" to political, as well as constitutional and legal, science would enrich their methodological tools. In particular, its application to the analysis of political systems makes it possible to discern behind the facade of the constitutional separation of powers not only who governs (i.e., exercises this or that authority granted by the constitution), but also who rules i.e., has the right to make final decisions on key issues of political life.

The aim of the research is study of mechanisms of activization and functioning of neologisms in sociopolitical discourse of the French language. It is shown in the article that in spite of active dynamics of vocabulary of modern politics lexicographical fixation of neologisms is distinguished by sufficient caution by virtue of objective reasons. Particular attention is given to analysis of content plane of lexical units taken from explanatory dictionaries of French. The most productive ways of formation of lexical neologisms in socio-political sphere of French is reviewed. The novelty of the study is in the involvement of media texts analysis data to discover the main vectors of the modern French language vocabulary development.

This work is based on the assumption that the formation of values (personal and societal) and language are interrelated, and that we can observe differences in points of view in user-generated text data. We leverage the Moral Foundations Theory to expand the scope of stance analysis by examining the narratives in favor or against several topics. Applying an expanded version of the Moral Foundations Dictionary to a benchmark dataset for stance analysis, we capture and analyze the relationships between moral values and polarized online discussions. Using this enhanced methodology, we find that each social issue has different "moral and lexical profiles." While some social issues project more authority related words (Donald Trump), others consists of words related to care and purity (abortion and feminism). Our correlation analysis of stance and morality revealed notable associations between stances on social issues and various types of morality, such as care, fairness, and loyalty, hence demonstrating that there are certain morality types that are more attributed to stance classification than others. Overall, our analysis highlights the usefulness of considering morality when studying stance. The differences observed in various viewpoints and stances highlights linguistic variation in discourse, which may assist in analyzing cultural values and biases in society.

Ctr Res Excellence Aboriginal Chro	Aboriginal community controlled health organisations address health equity through action on the social determinants of health of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in Australia	BMC PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						Social determinants of health; Aboriginal community-controlled primary health care; Indigenous; Primary health care	CARE	BackgroundIndigenous populations globally are continually striving for better health and wellbeing due to experiencing significant health and social inequities. The social determinants of health are important contributors to health outcomes. Comprehensive primary health care that is governed and delivered by Indigenous people extends beyond the biomedical model of care to address the social determinants of health. Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisations (ACCHOs) are known to provide culturally informed, holistic health services that directly and indirectly address the social determinants of health. The range and extent of their activities in addressing the social determinants of health, however, is not well documented.MethodsThe most recent ACCHO annual reports were retrieved online or by direct correspondence. For coding consistency, a dictionary informed by the World Health Organization's Conceptual Framework for Action on the Social Determinants of Health was developed. A document and textual analysis of reports coded ACCHO activities and the determinants of health they addressed, including intermediary determinants, socio-economic position and/or socio-political context. Summary statistics were reported. Representative quotes illustrating the unique nature of ACCHO service provision in addressing the social determinants of health were used to contextualise the quantitative findings.ResultsSixty-seven annual reports were collected between 2017 and 2018. Programs were delivered to population groups across the life span. Fifty three percent of reports identified programs that included work at the socio-political level and all annual reports described working to improve socioeconomic position and intermediary determinants of health through their activities. Culture had a strong presence in program delivery and building social cohesion and social capital emerged as themes.ConclusionsThis study provides evidence of the considerable efforts of the ACCHO sector, as a primary health care provider, in addressing the social determinants of health and health inequity experienced by Indigenous communities. For the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander population, ACCHOs not only have an essential role in addressing immediate healthcare needs but also invest in driving change in the more entrenched structural determinants of health. These are important actions that are likely to have an accumulative positive effect in closing the gap towards health equity.

J	Mohamed, EH; Moussa, ME; Haggag, MH				Mohamed, Ensaf Hussein; Moussa, Mohammed ElSaid; Haggag, Mohamed Hassan			An Enhanced Sentiment Analysis Framework Based on Pre-Trained Word Embedding	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Sentiment analysis; natural language processing; machine learning; word embedding; semantic; Word2Vec; glove	MACHINE	Sentiment analysis (SA) is a technique that lets people in different fields such as business, economy, research, government, and politics to know about people's opinions, which greatly affects the process of decision-making. SA techniques are classified into: lexicon-based techniques, machine learning techniques, and a hybrid between both approaches. Each approach has its limitations and drawbacks, the machine learning approach depends on manual feature extraction, lexicon-based approach relies on sentiment lexicons that are usually unscalable, unreliable, and manually annotated by human experts. Nowadays, word-embedding techniques have been commonly used in SA classification. Currently, Word2Vec and GloVe are some of the most accurate and usable word embedding techniques, which can transform words into meaningful semantic vectors. However, these techniques ignore sentiment information of texts and require a huge corpus of texts for training and generating accurate vectors, which are used as inputs of deep learning models. In this paper, we propose an enhanced ensemble classifier framework. Our framework is based on our previously published lexicon-based method, bag-of-words, and pre-trained word embedding, first the sentence is preprocessed by removing stop-words, POS tagging, stemming and lemmatization, shortening exaggerated word. Second, the processed sentence is passed to three modules, our previous lexicon-based method (Sum Votes), bag-of-words module and semantic module (Word2Vec and Glove) and produced feature vectors. Finally, the previous features vectors are fed into 11 different classifiers. The proposed framework is tested and evaluated over four datasets with five different lexicons, the experiment results show that our proposed model outperforms the previous lexicon based and the machine learning methods individually.

J	Watanabe, K				Watanabe, Kohei			Latent Semantic Scaling: A Semisupervised Text Analysis Technique for New Domains and Languages	COMMUNICATION METHODS AND MEASURES			English	Article							SENTIMENT ANALYSIS; POLICY POSITIONS; RUSSIA; WORDS; MEDIA; NEWS	Many social scientists recognize that quantitative text analysis is a useful research methodology, but its application is still concentrated in documents written in European languages, especially English, and few sub-fields of political science, such as comparative politics and legislative studies. This seems to be due to the absence of flexible and cost-efficient methods that can be used to analyze documents in different domains and languages. Aiming to solve this problem, this paper proposes a semisupervised document scaling technique, called Latent Semantic Scaling (LSS), which can locate documents on various pre-defined dimensions. LSS achieves this by combining user-provided seed words and latent semantic analysis (word embedding). The article demonstrates its flexibility and efficiency in large-scale sentiment analysis of New York Times articles on the economy and Asahi Shimbun articles on politics. These examples show that LSS can produce results comparable to that of the Lexicoder Sentiment Dictionary (LSD) in both English and Japanese with only small sets of sentiment seed words. A new heuristic method that assists LSS users to choose a near-optimal number of singular values to obtain word vectors that best capture differences between documents on target dimensions is also presented.

However, such understandings no longer comprehend other members of the so-called brown-skinned race who were once united with the Malay aggrupation: numerous Filipinos (and East Timorese), who inhabit the same broad geopolitical region. Challenging the recent narrowly defined conceptions of who is, or was Malay, this study recalls an inclusive borderless understanding acquired in antiquity by the Filipino nation, whose peoples were considered by Spanish and American colonisers and educated by their government to consider themselves as part of a pre-modern "Malay" world. Geohistorical evidence shows how such auto-consciousness evolved and preceded the entry of the term into the nearby British colonisers' lexicon, before its social-reconstruction for the perpetuation of post-colonial polities as well. The author interweaves his textual survey with the problematisation of the location of ethnicity, and points out the seemingly neglected corpus of Iberian works that demonstrate how the knowledge of Malayness could only have been approached by Europeans from a geographic periphery, of which the Philippine archipelago was very much a part, especially the Mindanao area. The author builds on and constructively critiques work by one scholar who had initiated the claims of the Filipino to Malayness. It is shown how sociocultural and geopolitical priorities can help or hinder the relaxation of definitions of who is Malay and where Malays are properly situated, if only because these counter perceptual rigidities, and allow the creation of hybrid third spaces that admit new possibilities of coexistence.

J	Aspinall, PJ				Aspinall, Peter J.			Ethnic/Racial Terminology as a Form of Representation: A Critical Review of the Lexicon of Collective and Specific Terms in Use in Britain	GENEALOGY			English	Review						ethnicity; race; terminology; representations; acronyms; social category; group identity	PARADOX	All ethnic/racial terminology may be seen as a form of representation, whereby meanings are generated by a range of social categorizers in settings of popular culture, political discourse, and statistical governmentality. This paper investigates these representations through a critical review of the lexicon of collective and specific ethnic/racial terms in use in Britain. Relevant studies and documents were identified through structured searches on databases of peer-reviewed literature and the websites of government census agencies. The full-text corpus of the UK Parliament was used to delineate the genealogies or etymologies of this terminology. The derivation of specific ethnic/racial terms through census processes tends to conform with the theoretical model of mutual entailment of social categories and group identities. This relationship breaks down in the case of the broad and somewhat abstract categories of race/ethnicity originating in the modern bureaucratic processes of government and advocacy by anti-racist organizations, opening up a space for representations that are characterized by their exteriority. Commonly used acronyms are little understood in the wider society, are confusing, and of limited acceptability to those they describe, while other collective terms are offensive and ethnocentric. Accurate description is recommended to delineate ethnic minority populations in terms of their constituent groups.

Vocabulary of Official Records in the Aspect of Discursive Formation "Discontinuity" (Based on the Materials of Records Dated by 1917-1933)	VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA FILOLOGIYA-TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF PHILOLOGY			Russian	Article						document discourse; record; content analysis; lexical organisation; discursive unity; discursive formation		The aim of the article is to identify quantitative characteristics of the lexical organisation of the text of the record in the aspect of the "discontinuity" of discursive unity caused by changes in the social reality in 1917-1933. Methodologically, the research is based on Michel Foucault's thesis on the "discontinuity" of discursive formations within discursive unity. Document discourse preserves the unity of the basic function and transforming in the aspect of language specificity and thus allows arguing this thesis. The discursive approach allows interpreting the repercussions of the social processes in the document corpus in a new way. Despite its function of fixing the sequence of real social events and their documentary proof, the record is scarcely investigated in this aspect. In the research, the leading methodological approach is discourse analysis; the main method is automated content analysis. The material for the analysis was corpora of records (1) of Tomsk Governorate People's Assembly dated by 1917 (25 documents, 91,686 word usages) and (2) of meetings at Tomsk institutions dated by 1918-1933 (126 documents, 41,630 word usages). The research showed that these corpora have significant difference in terms of lexical organisation. On the on hand, the document texts of the corpora demonstrate belonging to a discursive unity: they meet the factographic requirement and contain discursive markers (nomination of the type of document, typical communicative situations (and their parts), participants in communication, communicative actions), which indicates their belonging to the sphere of institutional communication. On the other hand, the quantitative analysis of the vocabulary shows the "discontinuity" of discursive formation, which is manifested: (1) in the different composition of categories and different usage of discursive markers: the markers of the 1918-1933 corpus show a much greater tendency to uniformity; (2) in the signs of transformation observed in the lexical organisation of the record: (a) an increase in the frequency of lexical units denoting new social and political phenomena, social statuses and actions (including punitive ones); (b) a decrease in the frequency of lexical units denoting both disappeared realities (nominations of territorial units) and phenomena which have lost their significance in the new social order. Thus, it can be argued that the lexical organisation of the record of different historical periods shows the "discontinuity" of discursive unity, and the analysed corpora can be considered different discursive formations. This "discontinuity" is primarily due to the changed social reality.

J	Barbosa, TVR				Ribeiro Barbosa, Tereza Virginia			Oedipus the Fox	CALIGRAMA-REVISTA DE ESTUDOS ROMANICOS			Portuguese	Article						tragedy; governance; responsibility; plague; translation		The article aims at selecting excerpts from Sophocles' play Oedipus Tyrannus, starred here as Oedipus the fox, and translating them. The leitmotiv that directs the selection is the confrontation of the plague by the ruler. As it is well known, the Sophoclean text, and particularly that which refers to the drama of Oedipus, is difficult to translate. Sophocles uses the power of the lexical and syntactic meanings of the Greek language to the maximum, starting with the title that came to us for the play which would give a treatise - if we focus on it only with the adjective (which is not an adjective, but a noun used as an adjective) (sic). The Oedipus king translation is neutralizing; the Oedipus tyrant translation is too biased, too captious, and too political for a term that could be translated in other ways such as the one we chose. In turn, the word Oedipus, etymologically, gives rise to incredible and pertinent variations if we choose to translate it. The article does not intend to discuss philology nor literature in depth, I will just go with a translation proposal to show the relevance of Oedipus for Brazil in a pandemic.

Public participation, engagement, and climate change adaptation: A review of the research literature	WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-CLIMATE CHANGE			English	Review						citizen engagement; climate change adaptation; public engagement; public participation	FLOOD RISK GOVERNANCE; PSYCHOLOGICAL ADAPTATION; CITIZEN COPRODUCTION; COMMUNITY; COMMUNICATION; PERCEPTION; FRAMEWORK; POLITICS; PARTNERSHIPS; INFORMATION	There is a clear need for a state-of-the-art review of how public participation in climate change adaptation is being considered in research across academic communities: The Rio Declaration developed in 1992 at the UN Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) included explicit goals of citizen participation and engagement in climate actions (Principle 10). Nation states were given special responsibility to facilitate these by ensuring access to information and opportunities to participate in decision-making processes. Since then the need for public participation has featured prominently in calls to climate action. Using text analysis to produce a corpus of abstracts drawn from Web of Science, a review of literature incorporating public participation and citizen engagement in climate change adaptation since 1992 reveals lexical, temporal, and spatial distribution dynamics of research on the topic. An exponential rise in research effort since the year 2000 is demonstrated, with the focus of research action on three substantial themes-risk, flood risk, and risk assessment, perception, and communication. These are critically reviewed and three substantive issues are considered: the paradox of participation, the challenge of governance transformation, and the need to incorporate psycho-social and behavioral adaptation to climate change in policy processes. Gaps in current research include a lack of common understanding of public participation for climate adaptation across disciplines; incomplete articulation of processes involving public participation and citizen engagement; and a paucity of empirical research examining how understanding and usage of influential concepts of risk, vulnerability and adaptive capacity varies among different disciplines and stakeholders. Finally, a provisional research agenda for attending to these gaps is described.

Especially when it comes to controversial social and political issues, our opinions and attitudes are hardly ever based on evidence alone. The Moral Foundations Dictionary (MFD) was developed to operationalize moral values in the text. In this study, we present MoralStrength, a lexicon of approximately 1,000 lemmas, obtained as an extension of the Moral Foundations Dictionary, based on WordNet synsets. Moreover, for each lemma it provides with a crowdsourced numeric assessment of Moral Valence, indicating the strength with which a lemma is expressing the specific value. We evaluated the predictive potentials of this moral lexicon, defining three utilization approaches of increased complexity, ranging from lemmas' statistical properties to a deep learning approach of word embeddings based on semantic similarity. Logistic regression models trained on the features extracted from MoralStrength, significantly outperformed the current stateof-the-art, reaching an F1-score of 87.6% over the previous 62.4% (p-value < 0.01), and an average F1-Score of 86.25% over six different datasets. Such findings pave the way for further research, allowing for an in-depth understanding of moral narratives in text for a wide range of social issues. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The history of translation of political texts in modern China is divided into three stages. Some macrological and micrological aspects of the Spanish version of the book The Governance of China by Xi Jinping are analysed. As for the macro analysis of this political text, we focus on the characteristics of institutional translation in China. In the micro analysis, we pay particular attention to different levels, from textuality, rhetoric and sentence structures to certain elements of the lexicon.

More in general, structured description of term meaning, in many forms and guises, has since the early days played a role in information systems (data dictionaries, data modelling), data management (business glossaries for data governance), knowledge engineering (applied logic, rule definition and management), and the Semantic Web (RDF). We observe that at the core of many different approaches to lexical meaning lies the combination of semantic networks and textual definitions, and propose to re-appreciate these relatively simple basics as the theoretical but also, and perhaps more so, the practical core of dealing with Data Semantics. We also explore some fundamental concepts from cybernetics, providing some theoretical basis for advocating crowdsourcing as a way of taking up a continuous lexical definition in and across domain communities. We discuss and compare various combined aspects in lexical definition approaches from various relevant fields in view of the A-Lex tool, which supports a crowdsourcing approach to the lexical definition in a data management context: Business Knowledge Mapping. We explain why this approach indeed applies most of the core concepts of "word meaning as a vehicle for dealing with data semantics in and across communities".

J	Oorzhak, SS; Bavuu-Surun, MV				Oorzhak, Shezhana S.; Bavuu-Surun, Mira V.			The vocabulary of protecting children's lives in Tuvan language	NOVYE ISSLEDOVANIYA TUVY-NEW RESEARCH OF TUVA			Russian	Article						Tuvan language; Tuvans; culture of childhood; Tuvan culture; vocabulary; Shamanism; protection of children's lives; Tuva; Tuvans of Mongolia; Tuvans of China		In Tuvan vocabulary of belief an important place belongs to the names of the rites and traditions linked to protecting children's lives. This vocabulary group has never been studied before. For the sources of our analysis, we used ethnographic studies of Tuvan culture, dictionaries of Tuvan language, literary texts, and fieldwork materials collected by the authors in their 2014-2017 expeditions to Mongolia and China. By its origin, the vocabulary used in the rites of protecting children's lives is almost always Tuvan with few exceptions. Some dialectal words are also in use. With the demise of the rite among Russian Tuvans, the phrase "urug syrtyyn shygzhaar" (the burial of the placenta) has been classified as obsolete. At the same time, a large part of this lexic group has returned to active use in contemporary Tuvan, although it is still marked as obsolete in dictionaries. This clearly reflects the socio-political transformations in the life of Tuvan people which happened throughout the past century. We can witness a living process of changing the structure of the meaning of a number of words.

On that basis, the generated sentiment evaluation consists nowadays of encoding and aggregating emotional information from a number of individuals and their populational trends. We hypothesized that the stochastic processes aimed to be measured by sentiment analysis systems will exhibit nontrivial statistical and temporal properties. We established an experimental setup consisting of analyzing the short text messages (tweets) of 6 user groups with different nature (universities, politics, musicians, communication media, technological companies, and financial companies), including in each group ten high-intensity users in their regular generation of traffic on social networks. Statistical descriptors were checked to converge at about 2000 messages for each user, for which messages from the last two weeks were compiled using a custom-made tool. The messages were subsequently processed for sentiment scoring in terms of different lexicons currently available and widely used. Not only the temporal dynamics of the resulting score time series per user was scrutinized, but also its statistical description as given by the score histogram, the temporal autocorrelation, the entropy, and the mutual information. Our results showed that the actual dynamic range of lexicons is in general moderate, and hence not much resolution is given within their end-of-scales. We found that seasonal patterns were more present in the time evolution of the number of tweets, but to a much lesser extent in the sentiment intensity. Additionally, we found that the presence of retweets added negligible effects over standard statistical modes, while it hindered informational and temporal patterns. The innovative Compounded Aggregated Positivity Index developed in this work proved to be characteristic for industries and at the same time an interesting way to identify singularities among peers. We conclude that temporal properties of messages provide with information about the sentiment dynamics, which is different in terms of lexicons and users, but commonalities can be exploited in this field using appropriate temporal digital processing tools.

J	Yudin, A				Yudin, Alexey			THE AZBUKOVNIK OF DAVID ZAMARAY, A PROOFREADER OF THE MOSCOW PRINT YARD: TIME AND WORD	QUAESTIO ROSSICA			Russian	Article						history of book printing in Rus'; Azbukovnik; David Zamaray; Moscow Print Yard; "Lithuanian press"; books		This article examines the Alphabet Book (Rus. Azbukovnik) by David Zamaray, a proofreader of the Moscow Print Yard in the 1620s. Relying on the existing lexicographic tradition, David Zamaray created a new type of Azbukovnik, one mostly related to his professional activity. Zamaray's Azbukovnik reflects the new vocabulary that came to Muscovite Russia with books of the so-called "Lithuanian press". The selection and fixation of this vocabulary in the new dictionary are determined by the lexicographer's individual approach. At the same time, the few remaining copies indicate not only the elitist nature of Zamaray's work, but are also characteristic of different periods in its creator's life. The late sixteenth century (1596) witnessed the publication of works by Lavrenty Zizany (including his Lexis) and saw the release of the so-called "concise" version of Zamaray's Azbukovnik. Al the time, he was still a monk at the monastery of St Anthony of Rome in Novgorod, the western boundary of Muscovite Russia. In the 1620s, Zamaray worked for the Moscow Print Yard; the interest of the Moscow authorities in the books of the Lithuanian press grew, and a new version of Zamaray's Azbukovnik was created. In the 1630s, the dictionary's creator was supposedly exiled due to the changes caused by the death of Patriarch Filaret and the approval of the final text of his lexicographic work, Each of these periods is reflected in Zamaray's Azbukovnik, Being at the centre of the ideological reforms initiated and suspended by Patriarch Filaret, Zamaray was forced to take into account the changing political situation in the Muscovite state, This author of the early modern period created a new type of Azbukovnik, one which not only pays tribute to tradition, but also shows more and more individual traits of the creator.

J	Leavy, S; Keane, MT; Pine, E				Leavy, Susan; Keane, Mark T.; Pine, Emilie			Patterns in language: Text analysis of government reports on the Irish industrial school system with word embedding	DIGITAL SCHOLARSHIP IN THE HUMANITIES			English	Article							CHILD-ABUSE; RYAN REPORT	Industrial Memories is a digital humanities initiative to supplement close readings of a government report with new distant readings, using text analytics techniques. The Ryan Report (2009), the official report of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse (CICA), details the systematic abuse of thousands of children from 1936 to 1999 in residential institutions run by religious orders and funded and overseen by the Irish State. Arguably, the sheer size of the Ryan Report-over 1 million words-warrants a new approach that blends close readings to witness its findings, with distant readings that help surface system-wide findings embedded in the Report. Although CICA has been lauded internationally for its work, many have critiqued the narrative form of the Ryan Report, for obfuscating key findings and providing poor systemic, statistical summaries that are crucial to evaluating the political and cultural context in which the abuse took place (Keenan, 2013, Child Sexual Abuse and the Catholic Church: Gender, Power, and Organizational Culture. Oxford University Press). In this article, we concentrate on describing the distant reading methodology we adopted, using machine learning and text-analytic methods and report on what they surfaced from the Report. The contribution of this work is threefold: (i) it shows how text analytics can be used to surface new patterns, summaries and results that were not apparent via close reading, (ii) it demonstrates how machine learning can be used to annotate text by using word embedding to compile domain-specific semantic lexicons for feature extraction and (iii) it demonstrates how digital humanities methods can be applied to an official state inquiry with social justice impact.

J	Li, T; Zhu, YF				Li, Tao; Zhu, Yifan			How does China appraise self and others? A corpus-based analysis of Chinese political discourse	DISCOURSE & SOCIETY			English	Article						Appraisal; Chinese political discourse; discourse analysis; ideology; ideological square; negative other-presentation; positive self-presentation	NEWS; CONSTRUCTION; DISCUSSIONS; FRAMEWORK; SECTIONS; LANGUAGE; STORIES; L1	Political discourse is a major site where ideological construction of both Self and Others is carried out. Based on a corpus of 98 political texts issued by Chinese governing bodies from 2000 to 2018, this study adopts Appraisal System to analyse the lexical items that indicate attitudes towards China and other countries with a view to revealing the ways in which China and other countries are appraised in Chinese political discourse. It is found that (1) Chinese political discourse does represent the ideological square of positive Self-presentation and negative Other-presentation, but more frequently it negatively evaluates China's things (appreciation) rather than its behaviours (judgement) while more negative appraisals are used to describe Others' behaviours rather than Their things, (2) interestingly, while China upturns Others' negative profiles, it also upscales negative presentation of Self; likewise, China mitigates negative presentation of both Self and Others, (3) Chinese political discourse allows more external voices when expressing its attitudes towards Self. The analysis shows that the producers of Chinese political discourse skilfully use appraisal resources, sometimes implicitly, to construct a subtle but dynamic 'Self versus Other' ideological structure in Chinese political discourse, which enhances the understanding of China's moderate view on itself and others in its pursuit of national interests.

J	Kim, YH				Kim, Young-Hoon			Efforts to prepare inter-Korea medical consolidation: compilation of a medical dictionary for all of Korea	JOURNAL OF THE KOREAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION			Korean	Article						North Korea; Medicine; Medical dictionaries; Language		It is known that there are wide disparities in the medical terms and language that medical professionals currently use in South and North Korea. How much chaos can be expected when people will be able to come and go freely unless there is an effort to lessen these gaps? To minimize medical mess in advance and to provide a better environment to strengthen collaborative exchanges between South and North Korea, which should be independent of political beliefs and dynamics, as part of the efforts for inter-Korea medical consolidation, I would like to underscore the need to compile an integrative medical dictionary. For the compilation of such a dictionary, the following process and preparations are suggested. First, there should be a database of medical terminology from North Korea through a search of various types of literature in North Korea, including dictionaries, journals, and textbooks. Second, entry words for an integrative dictionary based on English terms should be included. Third, specialists in medical terminology from the northern side should participate in the editing process and hold discussions with their southern counterparts. Fourth, after the full discussion and consensus has taken place, print and web versions of the dictionary can be published. Furthermore, a dissemination plan should be established to be used widely with both sides. The above strategy should also be supported by not only the medical society in South Korea but also the Korean government.

J	Yang, JS; Ko, MS; Chung, KS				Yang, Jin Sol; Ko, Myung-Sook; Chung, Kwang Sik			Social Emotional Opinion Decision with Newly Coined Words and Emoticon Polarity of Social Networks Services	FUTURE INTERNET			English	Article						social media opinion; social big data; social big data analysis; emoticon; newly coined words; social emotional opinion		Nowadays, based on mobile devices and internet, social network services (SNS) are common trends to everyone. Social opinions as public opinions are very important to the government, company, and a person. Analysis and decision of social polarity of SNS about social happenings, political issues and government policies, or commercial products is very critical to the government, company, and a person. Newly coined words and emoticons on SNS are created every day. Specifically, emoticons are made and sold by a person or companies. Newly coined words are mostly made and used by various kinds of communities. The SNS big data mainly consist of normal text with newly coined words and emoticons so that newly coined words and emoticons analysis is very important to understand the social and public opinions. Social big data is informally made and unstructured, and on social network services, many kinds of newly coined words and various emoticons are made anonymously and unintentionally by people and companies. In the analysis of social data, newly coined words and emoticons limit the guarantee the accuracy of analysis. The newly coined words implicitly contain the social opinions and trends of people. The emotional states of people significantly are expressed by emoticons. Although the newly coined words and emoticons are an important part of the social opinion analysis, they are excluded from the emotional dictionary and social big data analysis. In this research, newly coined words and emoticons are extracted from the raw Twitter's twit messages and analyzed and included in a pre-built dictionary with the polarity and weight of the newly coined words and emoticons. The polarity and weight are calculated for emotional classification. The proposed emotional classification algorithm calculates the weight of polarity (positive or negative) and results in total polarity weight of social opinion. If the total polarity weight of social opinion is more than the pre-fixed threshold value, the twit message is decided as positive. If it is less than the pre-fixed threshold value, the twit message is decided as negative and the other values mean neutral opinion. The accuracy of the social big data analysis result is improved by quantifying and analyzing emoticons and newly coined words.

J	Ellero, D				Ellero, Diego			Words and forms of citizenship in the "Costituto" of Siena (1309-1310)	LINGUA E STILE			Italian	Article						citizen; Italian vernacular language; political vocabulary		Within the context of the Statuti devoted to governing city life in mediaeval Italian city-states, the paper analyses linguistic, historical and legal features in the Costituto of Siena, a major text in Italian vernacular language. The Costituto dates back to 1309-1310, and is older and more extensive than similar texts produced in Florence or in other Tuscan or Italian cities. The paper focuses on the word citizen (cittadino), obviously of central interest in a text devoted to rules governing the city life and behaviour. Cittadino is examined as a single lexical unit and in verbal contexts defining civil law, behaviour, rights and duties. Connected to citizen are citizenship (cittadinanza) and the rules for acquiring it from an another state or from the country. Obtaining or losing citizenship (and also how reacquire it) are also regulated by the Costituto.

The research in this area falls mainly into two directions: 1) classification models that optimize algorithms and features to predict the polarity of a text, and 2) lexiconbased models that utilize lexicons and rule-based approaches to determine the sentiment of a given text. In this paper, we present a system that constructs lexicon by utilizing both dictionary and context-based approaches and 2,25 million tweets collected from Twitter. The dictionary-based approach finds semantically associated keywords; however, this approach may not detect contextually related keywords. Thus, we apply context-based expansion utilizing neural networks and word-embeddings to find both syntactically and semantically related keywords within corpora without drift. Experimental results suggest that the proposed model yields better lexicons and outperforms the baseline model.

What happened to the political communication during this long period? By using content and statistical text analysis, three channels of political communication were analysed: online newspapers, social media and official speeches at the end of the consultations. The intent of the article is to examine some typical dynamics of the new ecosystem of political communication that are strictly linked, in other words: the increasing of disintermediation; the hybridization of institutional, media and social communication spheres; the supposed end of the mediation role of information professionals. This aim was raised also by placing a specific focus on the differences in communication style of the main leaders involved in the formation of the first Conte Government: Luigi Di Maio for the Five Stars Movement and Matteo Salvini for the Lega. By focusing on the entire period of the consultations and on the analysis of the contents conveyed through the various channels, it was possible to understand in depth the peculiarities of the communication strategies adopted, how they relate to each other and to targets and events. The analysis of the data highlighted the low heterogeneity of the peculiar lexicons of the various communication channels and the link between the differences in communication styles, as well as the means by which information and the temporal dimension are conveyed; in addition, it fosters to identify the differences between the main leaders Di Maio and Salvini on these aspects.

J	Guo, LJ				Guo Lijun			Lexical Representation of Image of China in Russian Publicistic Discourse	NAUCHNYI DIALOG			Russian	Article						China; PRC; Celestial; Celestial Empire; Celestial Oecumene; language image; discourse analysis; lexicographic description		The question of formation of language image of China in the Russian mass media is considered. The relevance of the study is due to the current political context, in which the creation of a positive image of a country for its residents and for representatives of other cultures is one of the tasks of domestic and foreign policy. The material for the study were the Russian lexemes for China, PRC, Celestial, Celestial Empire, Celestial Oecumene, which are found in publicistic texts extracted from the National corpus of the Russian language, the newspapers "KoMMepcaHTb" and "ApryMeHTbl akTbl" Through the discourse analysis the meanings associated with these proper names actualized in the contexts are identified. On the basis of the revealed pragmatic information, a dictionary entry is compiled in accordance with the principles of lexicographical description of synonymic series presented in the New Explanatory Dictionary of Synonyms of the Russian Language edited by Yu. D. Apresyan. It is noted that the ideas of the Moscow Semantic School (hereinafter - MSS) are very popular in China. It is shown that the integral dictionary description of synonymic series can be applied to proper names, which is not represented in either Russian or Chinese linguistics. The author comes to the conclusion that the image of China as a world leader with specific socio-cultural and political characteristics is formed in the Russian information space.

Lexical units of the language of information technologies and computer terms are studied on the basis of academic, technical and popular Russian and English scientific texts. Unlike the language of mass media, business, scientific, advertising, political, pedagogical, artistic, domestic and other discourses, the language of information technologies has not been sufficiently researched. There are practically no systematic and consistent works devoted to its formation. The relevance of the research topic is determined by the focus on the study of modern language tools that reflect the development of information and communication technologies for the effective implementation of professional communication in the context of globalization. The research employs general scientific methods of analysis, synthesis and generalization, as well as the method of electronic search in multimedia dictionaries and Internet resources. The article reveals the process of the formation of the language of information technologies: the emergence of the English neologisms and the adaptation of English-language borrowings in the Russian language. It also analyses the general use of modern computer terminology and its functioning in scientific discourse. The author concludes that the language in the field of information technology is constantly contributing to the lexical and phraseological systems of Russian and other languages, borrowing and accumulating English terms through replication, transliteration, transcription and other means of translation. In the process of the formation of the IT language, the appearance of numerous slang and jargon terms is observed.

J	Kemper, D				Kemper, D.			THE BEGINNINGS OF FOREIGN CULTURAL POLITICS IN RUSSIA Part 3. Heinrich von Huyssen's European Network in the Service of the Foreign Cultural Policy under Peter the Great	NOVYI FILOLOGICHESKII VESTNIK-NEW PHILOLOGICAL BULLETIN			English	Article						Heinrich von Huyssen; Tido Henricus a Lith junior; foreign cultural policy; first German-language biography of Peter the Great		Heinrich von Huyssen's cultural and political work was certainly not limited to promoting Russia's image and the tsar's governmental policy through his own writings. He furthermore developed a differentiated and intricate system with the intention of exercising influence over the public opinion of Russia in Western Europe. Heinrich von Huyssen made systematic use of networks of European scholars and provided them not only with finished texts but also detailed information from other authors. It seems likely that his experiences with Neugebauer led to the decision not to identify himself as the author of his works and rather to deliver information and materials to others in such a way that they were then in the position to transmit a convincing and positive image of Russia using authentic documents from the Moscow (and then later Saint Petersburg) chancellery. Thus, he influenced the way in which the reports on Russia were presented in European newspapers and journals, lexica, travel writing, historical works and biographical and autobiographical writing. Particular attention is paid in the paper to the first German-language biography of Peter the Great, which came out in 1710. The tone of the writing evokes justified doubts about the claim that the text might have been written by a German-speaking author. Furthermore, the analysis of the biography demonstrates that the writer has an immense quantity of documents at his disposal which can obviously only come directly from the chancellery of the Russian court.

Since current moral values in society and public consciousness are not static and change due to events in political, economic, scientific, cultural and other areas of human life, we believe that publicistic texts reflect the condition of mentality of a particular society during a particular historical period. The main goal of this research is to study the impact of the social and cultural context on the semantic structure of publicistic texts and elucidate in what way this influence is relevant to the changes in social consciousness. The material of the study includes current Russian and Polish publicistic texts from mass media sources ("Regnum", " Izvestia", "Kommersant", " PT", "W polityce", "Newsweek", "dziennik. pl", etc.), as well as Russian and Polish political lexicography (Mustafin 2012; Sanxharevskij 2010; Wasiluk, Zmarzer 2012, etc.), and the results of an associative experiment conducted among 170 Russian and Polish participants, The findings demonstate possible connections and further tendencies of the actualization of words, which deviate from dictionary meanings, The results of the investigation carried out with the help of contextual analysis also allowed us to conclude that the attention to the sense-forming function of the context is methodologically essential for the study of publicistic texts and their translation into a foreign language because the changes in people's mentality under the influence of social and cultural contexts are materialized in the contextual meanings. They are also reflected in the transformation of word meanings: a word can acquire additional connotations or meanings which in some cases may fully replace the dictionary meanings. The results of the research can be used in sociolinguistics, lexicography and translation of publicistic texts.

Throughout the lexicon and dictionary of the legal terminology and criminology, in terms of the meaning, there is no lexis or word more complicated than of the term crime or misdemeanor. In the law literature and world the comprehensive term of "crime" is used and punishment is foreseen for its executive enforcement. When a verdict wants to acquire its sovereignty or religious (canonical) nature, that decree or verdict must go along its stages from the initial to the end. These steps involve fabrication (creation) and announcement and verification and implementation (execution). When a verdict implies as a governmental rule, as well as the religious rules, the four above steps are passed, and till these stages are completed, the attributing of verdict to its source will be permissible. In the religious or judicial term, crime is the act (conduct) or the abandonment (omission) of the act (promise or omission of promise) that Islam considered obligatory or forbidden to commit or abandon it which a mundane or heavenly punishment has been imposed. In other words, crime is an opposition or objection to the orders and desecration of a book and a tradition, or committing act that leads to the corruption of an individual or society. In jurisprudence, without implying the term "crime", definitions of acts which are deserve by ta'zir (flogging, discretionary punishment) and punishment. It is mentioned that committing deadly sins and insisting on minor sin is deserved to discretionary punishment awarded by judge; in other texts, it is stated: The committing of prohibited acts and the leaving obligatory measures, which is not specified in the canon law, requires discretionary punishment awarded by judge. Accordingly, in jurisprudence the crimes are related to physical or corporal integrity which are often referred to as "crimes (felonies)" and involve retaliation or Blood money (diya), or they are crimes which their punishment are determined by canon law of Islam, and referred to as " Islamic prescribed punishment (provisions, ambit)", otherwise they will be titled " discretionary punishment awarded by judge ".

J	Sawaniewska-Mochowa, Z; Sakalauskiene, V				Sawaniewska-Mochowa, Zofia; Sakalauskiene, Vilija			The Lithuanian and Polish linguistic legacy of Antanas Juska from a twenty-first-century perspective	ACTA BALTICO-SLAVICA			Polish	Article						Antoni Juszkiewicz (Antanas Juska); nineteenth century; bilingual dictionaries; identity; ethnolinguistics; new perspectives in the study of Polish-Lithuanian sources		This article presents the assumptions of new research on the legacy of Antanas Juska, recorded in Lithuanian and Polish. We assume that the forgotten works of this bilingual author from Lithuania, mainly translation dictionaries, are an underestimated study material for interdisciplinary research. They are particularly important for understanding the rich conceptualisations of the world by two collective subjects, Poles and Lithuanians, co-existing in Lithuania under the Russian partition. We have formulated two research hypotheses: (1) the bilingual dictionaries authored by Antanas Juska, who was a Catholic priest, are not only a valuable source of knowledge about the state of the Polish and Lithuanian languages in the nineteenth century, but above all specific cultural texts which form part of the social discourse of their time and place, and thus carry relevant ethnolinguistic and ethnocultural information; (2) bilingual dictionaries as a genre had an impact on the crystallisation of Lithuanian national awareness and the strengthening of cultural identity of Lithuanians in the second half of the nineteenth century. Juska's linguistic legacy will be jointly studied by Polish and Lithuanian-researchers from different perspectives, applying the tools and methods available in twenty-first-century humanities. I. In the ethnolinguistic and ethnohistorical paradigm: in view of the hypothesis that bilingual dictionaries constitute a narrative about the world and its historical time, we extract linguistic data that will enable us to capture the lexical and conceptual symmetry and asymmetry between the linguistic woldview of Poles and Lithuanians in the context of the crystallisation of Lithuanian national awareness. II. In the comparative perspective: (1) we will present Juska's lexicographic legacy against the background of the Lithuanian and Polish lexicographic tradition; we will confront the lexicographic practice and the macro- and microstructure of his dictionaries with important works of Lithuanian lexicography and contemporary dictionaries recording colloquial, dialectal and regional vocabulary of various sub-regions of Lithuania; (2) we will compare the Polish material recorded in Juska's translation dictionaries with dictionaries of the general, dialectal and regional Polish language from Lithuania; (3) we will answer the question whether the introduction of Russian translations into the Lithuanian-Polish dictionary published by the Imperial Academy of Sciences in Saint Petersburg was merely a political requirement stemming from the political situation and censorship, or whether-these translations complement the meanings of the Polish and Lithuanian entries. III. In the sociolinguistic and communication aspect: language contact and multilingualism, and the attendant processes of borrowing, mixing and "combining" vocabulary among users of the regional Polish language and spoken Lithuanian. Our research draws the attention of linguists to old, underestimated texts. It also indicates the cognitive value of linguistic analysis open to history, ethnology and identity studies. By studying Juska's linguistic legacy in the context of modern scholarship, we introduce it into the sphere of collective life of Lithuanians and Poles. In this way, we create a plane for a better mutual understanding which will foster the overcoming of negative national stereotypes.

This study focuses on interpreter's manipulative strategies from appraisal theory developed by Jeremy Munday as a major target in the political translation task and explores how governmental statements and reports are interpreted bilingually in Hong Kong. There is a chosen interpreting corpus of 10 transcribed HKSAR policy addresses delivered by two Hong Kong chief executives from 2007 to 2016, indicating the norms of source and target texts. High frequency keywords were selected, identified and analyzed within the corpus. The framework of ideological manipulation was used to describe the interpreting tasks and to exhibit the process where ideology is often taken for granted. This research aims to find that there are lexical preferences by interpreters in the speech full of political, social and ideological issues. The study also employs empirical approaches in both qualitative and quantitative approaches.

J	Sinjori, T				Sinjori, Tena			SOCIOLINGUISTIC ANALYSIS OF THE FOREWORDS IN CZECH AND CROATIAN MONOLINGUAL DICTIONARIES	FLUMINENSIA			Croatian	Article						Czech Lexicography; Croatian Lexicography; Ideology; Socialism; Nation		This paper takes a critical approach to understanding a dictionary as a neutral source of knowledge. A dictionary is studied as a collection of traces left in it by its authors and the society in which the dictionary is created. The main aim of this study is to discover how the monolingual explanatory Czech and Croatian dictionaries reflect differences in social organisation of the two former socialist republics: Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia. A sociolinguistic comparative analysis of the forewords of Czech and Croatian dictionaries published during the socialist period was carried out. Special attention was paid to the parts of the text referring to the social reality and circumstances related to the creation of each dictionary. The main hypothesis was that in Czech dictionaries more attention had been dedicated to socialism and its relations to lexicography, whereas in Croatian dictionaries the topic of language as an index of national identity had prevailed. The analysis reveals differences in the status of lexicography in the two societies and describes extralinguistic (economic, ideological, political) impacts on lexicography. The results confirm the hypothesis that the topic of socialism is prevalent in Czech dictionaries, as opposed to the subject of nation being more present in Croatian dictionaries.

J	Javed, M; Kamal, S				Javed, Muhammad; Kamal, Shahid			Normalization of Unstructured and Informal Text in Sentiment Analysis	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED COMPUTER SCIENCE AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Informal; normalization; opinion mining; roman; sentiment analysis; text preprocessing	TWITTER	Sentiment Analysis is problem of natural language processing which deals with the extraction and analysis of public sentiments shared about target entities over microbloging websites. This field has gained great attention due to the huge availability of decision making textual contents. Sentiment Analysis has enormous application areas such as; Market Analysis, Service Analysis, Showbiz analysis, Movies, sports and even the popularity and acceptance rate of political policies can also be predicted via sentiment analysis systems. Although tremendous volume of opinionative text is available but it is unstructured and noisy due to which sentiment classifiers can't achieve good outcomes. Normalization is the process used to clean noise from unstructured text for sentiment analysis. In this study we have proposed a mechanism for the normalization of informal and unstructured text. Proposed mechanism is comprised of four essential phases; Noise Reduction, Part of Speech Tagging, Stop Word Removal stemming and Lemmatization. Numerous experiments are performed on twitter data set with unsupervised lexicons and dictionaries. Python and Natural language toolkit is used for performing all four essential steps. This study demonstrates that utilization and normalization of informal tokens in tweets improved the overall classification accuracy from 75.42 to 82.357.

REPRESENTATION OF THE CONCEPT "WEALTH" IN THE DIALECT DISCOURSE: CONSTANTS AND TRANSFORMATIONS	VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA FILOLOGIYA-TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF PHILOLOGY			Russian	Article						concept; folk culture; richness; dialect discourse; Middle Ob dialects		The paper describes the verbalisation of the concept "wealth" in the dialect discourse, and reveals constants and transformations of folk culture which are reflected in its internal structure. The material is texts recorded in 1946-2016 on the territory of the Middle Ob dialects functioning. A concept is a unit of thinking which is represented by means of language and reflects features of culture. A concept is considered as a layered formation which includes conceptual, figurative and axiological components. In this paper, the authors consider only the conceptual layer of the concept "wealth": units representing this concept are revealed, their lexical meaning, functioning, system connections (synonymic, antonymic relations) and compatibility relations in the selected contexts, as well as relations with other concepts are considered. The concept "wealth" is not a concept of a peasant world; it also functions in urban culture, but has its features in dialect discourse. Among the units verbalising this concept are words that call wealth, rich people, money, and in certain contextual conditions antonymous units that nominate "poverty" and poor people, because poverty is the lack of material values, wealth, and the presence of one member of the opposition implies the absence of the other one: "I'm old, wealth is not necessary... "; "We had a kulak, there were ten cows in his yard, and only four in the artel"; "now, we live none the less. And our parents lived poorly, very poorly"; "State farms are better. Money is on the hands and bread is too. There was a lot of workday units, and what the hell?". It is determined that wealth is primarily associated with utilitarian objects and with objects that furnish the functioning of the family in the peasant culture. So, measures of wealth are food, clothing, livestock, households, dishes, furniture, jewelry (gold), house, interior, car, rites and their paraphernalia. The concept "wealth" has connections and intersections with such concepts as "money", "work", "life", "family", "house", "exile", etc. Transformations of ideas about wealth are caused by the change of epochs, social, political, economic and territorial factors. The study of concepts is important for lexicographic practice, as it expands the understanding of a particular phenomenon and allows to correct dictionary entries. Wealth in folk culture is not only an abundance of material values and money (as it is shown in many dictionaries), it is a result of hard work, and is objects with utilitarian purpose.

Sentiment analysis is a technique used for identifying the polarity (positive, negative, or neutral) of a given tweet, using either machine learning approaches or sentiment lexicons. This paper presents two resources. The first is the Saudi dialect sentiment lexicon (SauDiSenti), which is a sentiment lexicon for sentiment analysis of Saudi dialect tweets. SauDiSenti comprises 4431 words and phrases from modem standard Arabic (MSA) and Saudi dialects manually extracted from a previously labelled dataset of tweets obtained from trending hashtags in Saudi Arabia. The second is a testing dataset comprising 1500 tweets evenly distributed over three classes: positive, negative, and neutral. To evaluate the performance of SauDiSenti, we used precision, recall, and F measure and compared it to AraSenTi a larger Arabic sentiment dictionary. The data suggest that AraSenTi outperforms SauDiSenti only when both positive and negative tweets are considered, whereas SauDiSenti outperforms AraSenTi when positive, negative, and neutral tweets are considered. Despite the small size of SauDiSenti, its use for sentiment analysis of Saudi dialect tweets shows promising results in comparison to the automatically constructed larger dictionary AraSenTi. SauDiSenti and the testing dataset are available for download at http://corpus.kacstedu.sa/more_info.jsp. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

J	Chen, WG				Chen, Wenge			Identity and Affiliation: Exploring Chinese Lexicographers' Communal Identification in the 1970s	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF LINGUISTICS			English	Article						Identity; Affiliation; Bilingual Dictionary; Critical Discourse Studies; Systemic Functional Linguistics; Critical Lexicography		This paper explores how discursive and language resources were appropriated by bilingual lexicographers to establish solidarity with the powerful linguistic community and to create affiliation with members of their community. Informed by critical discourse studies and systemic functional linguistics, it showcases how Chinese lexicographers in the 1970s, constrained by the social context of the Cultural Revolution, accommodated to the revolutionary group by appropriating the dominant classism' discourse and revolutionary' language in their lexicographic text. The appropriation and subsequent linguistic convergence led to a change in the English language and the dictionary as a genre, projected the lexicographers' revolutionary identities, helped them co-identify with the dominant revolutionary group and saved them from possible political consequences. It is argued that linguistic convergence serves to create affiliation and that identities are patterns of meaning inflected by membership. Additionally, the dictionary is never an instrument neutrally and objectively conveying information, but is a site of ideological struggle.

In lexicographic works and in the literature in the field of political linguistics, propaganda is not understood unambiguously. Polish researchers define propaganda as the spreading of some views, particular political beliefs or attitudes, as well as attempts to influence behaviour by means of persuasive and/or manipulative nature. Propaganda has negative connotations associated with its flourishing in authoritarian regimes, where it was accompanied by censorship and government control of the mass media. In Polish political linguistics, the analyzed phenomenon refers predominantly to the socialist language, but polemical voices are also heard, emphasizing the inherent entanglement of politics and propaganda and the presence of propaganda in democratic regimes, where it serves the purposes of gaining and retaining power. The term propaganda is thus not neutral and as such, according to the author, should not be used as a scientific term.

In this article, I propose a discursive approach to analysing opposition-government blame games where top politicians try to persuade mass audiences to side with them in disputes over government's culpability by using carefully crafted written texts. Drawing insights and concepts from the tradition of discourse-historical studies into political communication as well as the recent literature on blame avoidance in government, I analyse conflicting opinion pieces published by the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition in the UK in the wake of the global financial crisis that developed since 2007. I present a basic functional argument model of attributing and avoiding blame, reconstruct the competing argumentation schemes that help us interpret public debates over the crisis, and show how blame is attached or deflected using various persuasive discursive devices, such as metaphors, lexical cohesion, and ways of framing and positioning, that underlie particular attacks, justifications, or excuses. In conclusion, I emphasise the importance of looking beyond the formal structure of the arguments to identify the more subtle emotional appeals used in government-related blame games.

Thoughts and opinions are written on rating sites, forums, social networks, blogs and other media. Such opinions constitute a valuable source of information for companies, governs and consumers, but it would be humanly impossible to analyze and locate the opinions in those assessments, due to the large volume and different origins of the data. For this, approaches and techniques of opinion mining in texts are used. Objective: To identify and characterize the techniques used for mining data in public opinion repositories regarding hotels, since the opinion mining area has offered necessary subsidies for decision-making related to hotel management. Besides, to identify, specifically, studies that investigated the opinions about the sustainability of hotels. Method: A systematic mapping was performed to characterize the research area. Results: It was identified that, among the main approaches, 31% of the works found use only data mining, while 55% exclusively use machine learning techniques, and 14% both. Conclusion: The most relevant studies in such research lines adopt machine learning algorithms such as Naive Bayes, SVM, LDA, decision tree, besides aspect-based techniques and SentiWordNet lexicon dictionaries. There are still opportunities to explore opinion mining solutions in online hotel reviews, mainly by taking into consideration aspects related to sustainable practices and sustainability levels practiced by each hotel.

The raw texts are tokenized, lemmatized, and morphologically processed. This paper describes two main research directions for the extension and improvement of CoRoLa. The first issue discussed is the adding of new layers of annotation, such as noun and verb groups, syntactic trees, and some semantic information. Secondly, we describe an interoperability standard for textual and lexical resources for Romanian (such as an wordnet and a dictionary) which opens the way for an efficient coupling of these resources, with the benefit of a much more diverse display about the use of the Romanian language.

In recent decades, with the development of information technology, there have appeared computer programmes which perform the same work in a matter of minutes. Electronic concordances consist of a huge database of texts, including excerpts from national and regional newspapers, specialized magazines on various topics for all ages, scientific literature and fiction, letters, office memorandums, student essays, as well as recordings of conversations made by volunteers of different ages and backgrounds, business and government talks and radio programmes, and programmes which enable people to analyze this database. These electronic concordances are widely used in the creation of dictionaries and thesauri. In addition, the type of information and computer technology under consideration offers great opportunities for teachers of foreign languages. Using computer concordances, one can get a list of sentences in which a certain word is used (up to 90 words before and after it). These concordances are represented by Real Academia Espanola on the websites (corpus.rae.es, corpusdelespanol.or). Concordance allows finding original examples of the use of words, expressions, grammatical structures, text structures as well as creating exercises based on them. Concordance can also be used for various types of work: to work with synonyms which require actualization in different contexts; to analyze the traditions of the syntactic compatibility of a linguistic unit; to analyze the patterns of the use of a certain morphological form of a word; to analyze the problem of "false friends" (using parallel concordances), including the use of examples to compare the number of lexical units in different languages. The essence of this concept is that students use concordance to analyze the original cases of using the language in oral and written speech, which allows them to take a more active position in the study of a foreign language, to derive the rules themselves. Thus, it is authentic material which becomes the basis of learning.	[Paymakova, E. A.; Ruiz, T.

The present study, based on a corpus of interpreted political discourse from China, explores how the stance of the Chinese government is interpreted from Chinese to English. The parallel bilingual corpus comprises 15 transcribed press conferences of two Chinese premiers from 1998 to 2012 that were interpreted into English by seven institutional interpreters. High-frequency keywords are identified with corpus tools and patterns of their translation are analysed. The framework of stance-taking is used to discuss critical points' in interpreting and to reveal the way in which ideology is decontextualized. It is found that the interpreters' lexical choices reflect the government's attitude and stance on various political and social issues. The investigation of critical points in interpreting (and translation) can provide valuable insights into a nation's stance, which might not be achieved by looking at the monolingual text alone. The study may also inform empirical approaches to critical translation studies, which integrates the methodological strengths of critical discourse analysis and descriptive translation studies.

ARNOLDOV	TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL			Russian	Article						Tomsk; university; students; professors; Russian Revolution of 1917; L.V. Arnoldov; memoirs		The memoirs of the former student of the Faculty of Law of the Tomsk university, publicist and researcher of China L.V. Arnoldov Zhizn' I revolyutsiya [Life and Revolution] as a source of the history of the university community during the revolutionary events of 1917 are regarded in the article. The author's life, his childhood and youth spent in various cities of Siberia, studying at the Tomsk university, participation in the Civil War on the side of the White Army, emigration to China and then to Brazil are described. Arnoldov's book of memoirs as a historical source, its genre features are analyzed. It is emphasized that along with the events of the author's life, these memoirs contained valuable reflections of the author about the time, characteristics of people whose views impacted the development of the socio-political thought of that period. Influence of these views on the assessments and descriptions of the period presented in the memoirs are considered. The political views of students and professors of the Tomsk university on the eve and during the February Revolution of 1917 are characterized. The events of February 1917 in Tomsk as well as the reaction to the revolution of students and professors of the Tomsk university through a comparative historical analysis of the memoirs of L.V. Arnoldov and the diaries of a student of the Tomsk Technological Institute P.A. Leonov are studied. The activities of the agencies of student self-government L.V. Arnoldov was a member of, aimed at the participation of students in the organization of the educational process, are considered. The relations between the university community and the Soviet government after the October events in Petrograd are analyzed. The characteristics of the images of professors of the Tomsk university of that period from the text of the memoirs are presented. The everyday life of professors and students of the Tomsk university at the time of the revolution and their further destinies which can be traced through the prism of Russian history of the first half of the 20th century are examined on the basis of archival materials, biographical dictionaries and periodicals. It is concluded that the memoirs of L.V. Arnoldov have a value not only as an instrument of reconstructing the revolutionary events of 1917 in Tomsk and their influence on the everyday life of the university community of the city, but also as an example of the alternative method of development of Russia in the period of modern history.

The People's Voice During the 2016 Presidential Campaign	AMERICAN BEHAVIORAL SCIENTIST			English	Article						2016 presidential campaign; public opinion; textual analysis; national discourse; Hillary vs; Trump		This study examines the 2016 presidential campaign by comparing the voice of the people with that of the press and the political establishment. By systematically collecting some 5,000 texts (political speeches, ads, and debates alongside print and broadcast coverage) during the campaign and comparing them with 1,200 letters to the editor written in 12 small American cities, an overview of the nation's quadrennial dialogue was made possible. By also comparing this sample with similar texts gathered for the 1948 through 2012 presidential campaigns, the 2016 campaign could be seen in sharper relief. These comparisons were facilitated by DICTION, a lexically based, content analytic program capable of producing rhetorical profiles of the discourse sampled. Overall, I found (a) that each voice produces distinct verbal patterns, thereby revealing its unique role in the polity; (b) that all three voicespoliticians, the press, and the peoplewere more strident and more philosophical in 2016 than in prior years; (c) that Donald Trump and his letter writing supporters were especially dismayed by the status quo; and (d) that many of the stereotypes about letter writers turn out not to be true, with only a small percentage being blind ideologues. The rest were either issue specialists, analytical problem solvers, champions of a particular worldview, or voters interested in dissecting the psychological makeup of the candidates.

ANALYSIS OF SEMANTICS OF PHRASEOLOGICAL EXPRESSIONS, ILLUSTRATING THE EMOTIONAL STATE OF FEAR IN GERMAN-LANGUAGE PUBLICISTIC TEXTS	TURKISH ONLINE JOURNAL OF DESIGN ART AND COMMUNICATION			English	Article						linguistics; phraseology; emotion; publicism; semantics; fear		This article considers the phraseological expressions that interpret the state of fear, as well as their lexical-semantic analysis based on the publicistic discourse of German language. It should be noted that it is an emotive text, in contrast to the dictionary definition, which conveys the shades of the emotive semantics of a word most fully and brightly. Thus, a text appears to be a communicative unit with an emotional component that regulates the relations with the human factors of an individual: emotional, mental states, etc. As a rule, newspaper articles and the texts of a social-political nature served as the basis for the publicistic discourse analysis. The analysis showed that German-language publicistic texts often use phraseological units as a heading to strengthen the emotional expressiveness; Also fear can be ambivalent. The ambivalent nature of fear is expressed by "the ambiguity of a person's relationship to the world around him, as well as the contradictory nature of the value system. The use of complex words (composites), which unlike the Russian language is embodied in journalistic discourse is also characteristic of the German language. Composites, as a rule, consist of two components, the combination of which indicates the subject of fear state.

The application of sentiment analysis to social media texts has great potential, but faces great challenges because of domain heterogeneity. Sentiment orientation of words varies by content domain, but learning context-specific sentiment in social media domains continues to be a major challenge. The language domain poses another challenge since the language used in social media today differs significantly from that used in traditional media. To address these challenges, we propose a method to adapt existing sentiment lexicons for domain-specific sentiment classification using an unannotated corpus and a dictionary. We evaluate our method using two large developing corpora, containing 743,069 tweets related to the stock market and one million tweets related to political topics, respectively, and five existing sentiment lexicons as seeds and baselines. The results demonstrate the usefulness of our method, showing significant improvement in sentiment classification performance. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

For a machine to understand the language, the challenge lies in resolving the ambiguities and capturing innovativeness. Due to its unstructured nature, discourse linking, required for understanding and generating text by a machine is a challenging task. Also, dealing with sentences varied in nature and changing them into generic structure is an additional challenge. This paper presents a way to create a discourse linking tool for English language. This tool is based on specially created lexicon and hand-crafted rules suited for discourse linking purpose. Currently available lexicons such as dictionaries, WordNet, etc. are not suited as they lack domain knowledge. Therefore, an ontology is developed for political news domain which serves as a lexicon and its inherent relations are used for discourse linking purpose.

People with hearing impairment have difficulties in developing reading skills. They present a reduced lexicon and a lack of knowledge of syntactic structures. With the support of technology, support applications have been developed to help different aspects of communication for the hearing impaired, for example, sign language dictionaries and exercises to identify words, among others, used at different academic levels. With the use of natural language processing is intended to create new alternatives targeting specific needs of the user. Our proposal will focus on the analysis of text, using images and additional information with respect to the context. This will allow users visualize the information in a way that can gradually increase the breadth of vocabulary and improve reading comprehension.

It explored sexism/nonsexism in political communication on 20 female ministers from four different Italian governments (2006, 2008, 2011, and 2013). It was conducted by textual analysis of 1,244 press headlines with the Spad-t statistical package. Results showed an overutilization of sexist language and variations in the degree of linguistic sexism with respect to different periods (less sexism in the headlines of the last two governments). In this way, findings underlined the conservative role of newspapers that eclipses women's active contribution, maintains their secondary role, and preserves politics as essentially alien to the female universe. This trend appears sensitive to the cultural and political context showing an increase of linguistic nonsexism in the time paralleled to an increase in the number of women parliamentarians.

A corpus-driven critical discourse analysis of government work reports in Greater China	TEXT & TALK			English	Article						corpus linguistics; corpus-driven methodology; critical discourse analysis; political discourse; China's government work report; Hong Kong policy address	POLITICAL DISCOURSE; IDENTITY; PRESS	Critical discourse analysis (CDA) in conjunction with a corpus-driven analytical methodology has evolved into a powerful qualitative and quantitative tool for deconstructing and studying political discourse. This study utilizes a corpus-driven CDA approach to examine the dynamics of power distance and the ideological stance in the context of Greater China, as conveyed in the 2013 Report on the Work of the Government of Mainland China and the Policy Address in Hong Kong. Concordancing software was used to generate frequency lists, co-selection patterns, and concgrams for detailed analysis. In particular, study examines differences in usage of the first-person plural pronoun we collocated with modal verbs and related lexical items. Concgrams in discourse analysis offer insights into the discursive practice of political actors in this unique political discourse genre. The findings show that the distribution and utilization of first-person plural pronoun we, and its interplay with other modal verbs and lexical items, comprising a specific "concgram," have provided textual and intertextual evidence for the analytical results of conventional critical discourse analysis. The discussions support that a methodological synergy between corpus linguistics and critical discourse analysis can serve as a powerful tool to deconstruct and analyze political discourses.

In any politically motivated posting there are some dominant keywords. At first, we have prepared a dictionary consisting of unique words collected from political or nonpolitical posts or comments and then trained using Naive Bayes algorithm based on probability theory. To identify the sentiment expressed in a new post or comment, we have extracted each word of the posting and then matched those with the dictionary words for classification. Finally, we have tested our algorithm using 200 postings from facebook and our result shows that the method can classify posts or comments with good accuracy.

Initially, the method performs lexical analysis to process input transliterated Kannada sentence to recognize and classify tokens using newly constructed source language lexicon Kannada WordNet. Then, newly designed recursive descent parser for the domain validates the transliterated Kannada sentence with the syntactic constructs/grammar rules. Further, the phrase mapper and output generation mechanisms are employed to obtain translated English sentence. The proposed methodology is evaluated on a data set containing transliterated Kannada sentences of text written in low resolution images of display boards of Karnataka government offices in India. The method achieves an average translation accuracy of 97.56%. The proposed method is robust and efficient in dealing with various issues such as construction of source lexicon, syntactic/semantic representation of language constructs, design of efficient parser, resolving differences between syntactic/semantic constructs of source and target language, construction of bilingual dictionary. The method also resolves word sense ambiguity, translation ambiguity, and provides accurate translation without errors.	[Kodabagi, Mallikarjun M.] REVA Univ, Sch C&IT, Bengaluru, India; [Angadi, S.

J	Zhu, CS; Zhang, JF				Zhu, Chunshen; Zhang, Junfeng			Dancing with Ideology: Grammatical Metaphor and Identity Presentation in Translation	META			English	Article						transitivity; grammatical metaphor; political translation; textual accountability		This paper begins with an account of a high-profile political speech event centring on a Chinese slangy expression '[we] bu zheteng' when it was used by the then Chinese President Hu Jintao in a 2008 speech, of which the Chinese government preferred a zero translation despite the existing translations and various choices already available in Chinese-English dictionaries. The paper then discusses from the perspective of grammatical metaphor how and why an innocent-looking pragmatic usage has given rise to a series of ideologically charged debates over its translation. To that end, the paper conducts a critical review of grammatical metaphor, a key Systemic Functional Linguistic concept in describing congruence-to-metaphor evolution of language. Our cross lingual observation of this translation-related speech event enables us to argue that different textual means of presentation/concealment of human participation in transitivity are key to accounting for the discursive function of grammatical metaphors and to discerning the "chain" between congruent and metaphorical expressions. In the light of concealment of human participation in the transitivity process, the paper also observes that it is the association between the vague self -referencing 'we' and the adverse actions/situations, that is, (causing) commotions, alluded to by the term zheteng that has made a semantically explicit translation ideologically less desirable. As such, this operation of zero translation appears to be an instance of discursive manoeuvre rather than a sign of semantic impasse. To substantiate its theoretical claim, the paper relates the case to some similar political speech events in the world's political arena and demonstrates how, prompted by this functional awareness of grammatical metaphors, one may devise a translation with better informed sensitivity to identity presentation/concealment in discourse.

We develop a strategy for identifying meaningful categories in textual corpora that span long historic durees, where terms, concepts, and language use changes. Our approach is able to account for the fluidity of discursive categories over time, and to analyze their continuity by identifying the discursive stream as the object of interest.

Through this corpus approach both a skeleton picture of both periods as well as of the current notions, typical of these widely different times, could have been, hopefully, drawn and through that, main features of both periods and society living in them obtained. The research is an off-spin of a Dictionary of the Totalitarian Period published recently and is to be seen as a continuation of it. The Totalitarian vocabulary and the corpus have been based (each around half a million of words), mostly, on the Communist newspapers while a corresponding corpus of the same newspaper type of texts from the Czech National Corpus has been used as a counterweight. Thus, effectively, vocabulary of these two periods spanned over some 50 years. In two steps, the first probe has concentrated on a simple inventory of the most frequent words of both periods. The initial small probe offered 25 most frequent autosemantic words where a considerable difference, even in such small vocabulary, is already evident. The prevalence of political notions for the Communist period was to be expected with dominant adjectives such as Soviet and socialistic. On the other hand, contemporary vocabulary reveals, among other things, a remarkable presence of words related to private ownership already. The second step has tried to confirm and make more precise the first one, offering a semantic analysis of the most frequent 1000 words from both times. It became more clear to what degree the Communist have been bent on all sorts of fight, struggle or war which reflected their constant uncertainty, a feature not to be found today (if any, fighting is now related to sports). Another prominent feature, dominant today but strongly underrepresented in the Communist time, is one related to economics and business (words such as private, money, investment, shares, customer). A contrastive list of lexemes not to be found in one of the periods is offered by way of a summary. The research has subsequently moved on to typical collocations of some key notions and words, showing thus rudimental semantics of these notions and their associations with other, period-prone words. Four words have been chosen for the comparison of their collocations here, namely truth, goal, fight and win. A comparison of the use of these four words through their collocations in both periods is shown in a table (having some 50 up to 75 *most frequent collocations). Typically, Communist collocations offered for fight include words as against imperialism, fascism, for peace while modern times seem to prefer fighting with corruption, crisis or even, more personally, with fatigue, for sport medals. Similarly, Communists won their fights mostly politically or at war, cf. proletariat/revolution has won, win over capitalism, while today win refers to sport mostly, such as in their category/in tournament, etc. Admittedly, this has been just an attempt which could be easily improved, if more data were used, although it did show some aspects of the public life of both periods.

The predominance of English origin in the specialized terminology, and especially in IT technology fits into a broader phenomenon of English influences that materializes through a massive penetration of words and sentence structures in all Romanian economic and socio-political branches - economy, government, politics, science and arts, in general. The manifestation of this phenomenon proves that we are dealing with a fairly quick process in the evolution of language. It is about the fact that Romanian is a Romance language and English is a Germanic one, which means that the grammatical structure, as the phonetic or the lexical, moreover, are different. Modern loans came, most often, directly, from English, i.e. British English or American English through writing, speech, or to the various electronic sources. The channels of previous loans were often indirect: loans depended, mainly, by the written sources and were made by the predominant language in the most prestigious schools and society. Therefore, the French model had penetrated most of Europe, at least until 1930, and the German model was shown for a large part of northern and eastern Europe until the Second World War [2]. This mediation has left unmistakable traces in spelling, pronunciation, morphology, and the meaning of certain Anglicism. Thus, in some cases, all of English language characteristics, in form, faded. In addition, some English words are pronounced as if they came from French, even when the French language was not their intermediate input vocabulary. On the other hand, a major source of contact between the two languages, and perhaps the most important for the penetration of a large number of Anglicism, for their integration and adaptation was teaching and learning the foreign languages, in this case English language. Therefore, it would be very important for the correct analysis of loans to determine the status of English [2] as a subject in schools (compared to other languages taught, such as French, German or Russian), methods used, and the proportion of students, and the need for learning English language in higher education.

J	Lahdesmaki, T; Wagener, A				Lahdesmaki, Tuuli; Wagener, Albin			Discourses on governing diversity in Europe: Critical analysis of the White Paper on Intercultural Dialogue	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTERCULTURAL RELATIONS			English	Article						The Council of Europe; Europe; Dialogue; Intercultural; Policy; White Paper	MULTICULTURALISM; COMPETENCE; PRAGMATICS	The White Paper on Intercultural Dialogue, published in 2008 by the Council of Europe, is one of the first European level attempts to provide a common guideline for diversity politics in Europe. It introduces the idea of 'intercultural dialogue' as a new focus and a method of governing diversity. Our paper aims to investigate the explicit and implicit meanings included in the idea of 'intercultural dialogue' and how the idea is rhetorically operationalized as a policy in the White Paper. The investigation is conducted with a lexical and semantic analysis of the text in the White Paper and a discourse analysis of its rhetoric, in order to explore how the 'intercultural dialogue' as a policy relies on a mixture of ideas borrowed from different political discourses. The investigation revealed how the concept of intercultural dialogue and other related concepts, such as culture and diversity, embrace power hierarchies. The meanings of these concepts are produced from a hegemonic point of view which grants the 'intercultural dialogue' with the power positions of a dialoguer and a dialoguee. The policy rhetoric in the White Paper emphasizes social cohesion in Europe. Its policy discourse does not recognize the societal, cultural, historical, religious, or linguistic differences between European societies, but offers unified - and profoundly Western European - views for the governance of diversity. Formulating a common and generic diversity policy for Europe as a whole inevitably simplifies the idea of diversity in Europe and produces new hierarchies between the subjects and objects of these policies.

J	Chenier, NR				Chenier, Natasha Rose			"And words. They are not in my dictionary": A Lexicographical Study of James Joyce and the Oxford English Dictionary	JAMES JOYCE QUARTERLY			English	Article								James Joyce's Ulysses and the Oxford English Dictionary (OED) are unusual texts. Both are epic in scope; both make countless references to other works and explicitly absorb much of the preceding literature; both aim to set new creative and intellectual standards. Politically, the works are vastly different. While the OED aimed to document the (morally acceptable) established lexis, Joyce wished to challenge and redefine it. His liberalism with language and subject matter excluded references to his work from the OED for several decades. Ironically, while the first edition of the OED (in 1928) does not cite Joyce nor, to our knowledge, does its 1933 supplement, the OED 2 (1989) adds over 1,800 Joyce citations. Whereas the OED 3 (2000-) currently features 2,422 Joyce citations, many of those from the OED 2 have been removed for reasons that are unclear. Joyce is an example of the changeable place of modernist literature in the OED.										11	1	1	0	0	UNIV TULSA	TULSA	800 SOUTH TUCKER DR, TULSA, OK 74104 USA	0021-4183	1938-6036		JAMES JOYCE QUART	James Joyce Q.

The purpose of this paper is to analyse the construction of the actual/possible worlds and their representation from an imagological point of view, as both novels, and their filmic adaptations, bring together opposing worlds and world views. Thus, emphasis will be laid on the main trends of imagology and the techniques and principles that govern the analysis of imagotypical discourse. Being a research dedicated not only to image studies, but to the power relation brought forward by the representation of 'otherness', the present paper will touch upon those ideas that are of relevance to our comparative and contrastive study of Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness and the novel's adaptations on the screen: Coppola's Apocalypse Now Redux, and Roeg's Heart of Darkness.

J	Kemmer, K				Kemmer, Katharina			Elexiko as a Reference for Sociologists - Use of Language as a Reflection of socio-cultural and political Relations and Stereotypes in the Vocabulary	DEUTSCHE SPRACHE			German	Article								Language and extra-linguistic phenomena are closely intertwined. thus socio-cultural conditions and stereotypes are not only the subject of discussion, but are also indirectly displayed in many texts (e.g. from newspapers and magazines). In an online dictionary such as elexiko, which is being developed on the basis of a very large text corpus, a great deal of lexicographical information illustrates the mindsets and mentalities which are verbalised in these texts with reference to certain phenomena. This article is particularly interested in how changes in gender roles and a modified view of the family are reflected in the dictionary articles. It is clear that the conflict between family and career is the subject of discussion in many contexts in the corpus, and is therefore also to be found in the dictionary. The evaluation of elexiko articles makes clear that sociologists, too, will find it worth their while to take a look at the corpus-based dictionary when they cannot afford to undertake time-consuming searches themselves, or when they just need a quick insight into current usage.				katharinakemmer@gmx.de						32	0	0	0	0	ERICH SCHMIDT VERLAG	BERLIN-TIERGARTEN	GENTHINER STRASSE 30G, D-10785 BERLIN-TIERGARTEN, GERMANY	0340-9341			DEUT SPRACHE	Dtsch.

This is precisely the case of Vasile Voiculescu, who begun working on the Zahei Orbul novel ever since 1949, when he was frequently attending the cultural manifestations of the Antim monastery, and managed to complete it in 1954, shortly after the "Rugul aprins" movement was deemed illegal. Two parts of the novel are specifically designed as a warning on the social and political climate of the time: the second part (the salt mine episode) and the fourth part (the last chapter), the text acting as an anticipation of its author's sufferance as a future political prisoner, between 1958 and 1962. Voiculescu manages to outline the black universe of the mine's obscurity, a world trying to emulate the outside life through its own rules, a degraded and underdeveloped world, yet not an inhuman one. The last chapter may be regarded as a symbolic and religious narration, but is at the same time a reference to the period when the communist regime came to power. Through the Zahei Orbul novel, Voiculescu manages to capture the symbiosis of the actual social and political system and the fictional, symbolic one.

The victory was not simply a political one. Its spiritual influence was much greater. The Greek language became a common language for nearer Asia, and with the language went the culture, the art, and the thought. The influence thus exerted did not entirely drive out the local languages or the civilization. The Jewish community in this period was clearly bilingual and perhaps even trilingual. The texts from this period indicate that there were communities in which Greek was dominant and others in which Aramaic and Hebrew were more central. Numerous Greek words entered the Hebrew language. Both the Aramaic and the Hebrew of this period underwent transformation not only in the lexicon more than 3,000 Greco-Roman loanwords - but also in phonology, syntax, etc. The loanwords cover all aspects of life but are especially prominent in certain areas of material civilization (architecture, agriculture, fashion, commerce, and technology), public life (government, taxation, law, and warfare) and even indispensable terms of daily life. In the Rabbinical works. (Talmud, Midrash, and Targum), the Greek and Latin letters are transcribed according to purely phonetic principles. Thousands of other Greco-Roman terms in Modern Hebrew have been added in the modern technological era. It can be argued that in Hebrew, most learnt, scientific, or technical words are formed on a morphological basis of Latin or Greek, mostly not by direct borrowing but via Slavic languages (Russian, Polish and so on), or English. The present study deals with some words of Greek and Latin origin, which entered the Hebrew language twice, in different forms and meanings: once in Rabbinic Hebrew and second in Modern Hebrew, e.g., idiot, icon, campus, campaign, symphony, politics, diet, dilemma, itliz "butcher shop".

Within the multilingual and multicultural context of challenges and issues that characterize the European Union, the Romanian legal language is continuously evolving. During the 19th century, the French language and legal culture were still playing an important role in the creation of the Romanian society and the "best possible worldr was being built in the Romanian Principalities on a pattern brought to this Eastern part of Europe by the French diplomats, the Greek princes of the Istanbul neighborhood called Phanar and the Romanian political and cultural elites trained in France. In the 21st century, there has been an important shift in the field of linguistic, social and political influences, and the "American dream" has replaced the "French accent" in the perception of the ideas of modernization within the Romanian society. The globalization, but also the long-awaited English-speaking culture, penetrate the layers of today's modern Romanian society and democracy in the making. The question we analyze has to do with the evolution of the legal language and the legal discourse in Romanian, more specifically the language of human rights, as it is one of the most permeable branches of the legal terminology, due to the abundance of international legislation in this field, as well as to the presence of many foreign NGOs in Romania. Our inquiries were directed to the official texts, lexicons, NGO texts, dictionaries as well as the general language practice. We took into account the pragmatic coordinates of the discourse, namely the author, the addressee, the real or presumed intention of the speaker, as well as its locutionary, illocutionary and perlocutionary effects.

Functioning as political intermediaries between the Ottoman central government and local populations, the majority of the a'yan were effectively placed in an ambiguous position between the cosmopolitan demands of service as Ottoman officials and the cultural particularism of the local society in which they were or had become rooted. This study takes in hand the foundation document of a college (madrasa) built in mid-18th century Aleppo by a Muslim judge (qadi) and merchant, Tahazade Ahmad Efendi. Examining together the document's constituent elements, primarily the library inventory, personnel recruitment strategy, curriculum stipulations, and prayer supplications, this study discerns a calculated and fine-tuned effort on the part of the founder to fashion a distinct and autonomous social status and cultural identity. On the one hand, Ahmad Efendi identifies with the Ottoman legal and social establishment as through the prescribed teaching of Hanafi jurisprudence in the curriculum of the madrasa, the plurality of Hanafi texts in his library, and his cultivation of Turkish and Persian poetry in the Edeb-i Osmani tradition. On the other hand, Ahmad Efendi carves out a space within which he asserts his own cultural and intellectual orientation. This is seen most notably through promotion of his sharif lineage and pursuit of group leadership as naqib al-ashraf, which is reinforced by ownership of prestigious genealogical texts in his library; the cultivation of an pre-Ottoman awareness tied primarily to the Mamluk Sultanate as seen in his concentrated acquisition of chronicles and biographical dictionaries of that era and his affiliation with multiple pre-Ottoman Sufi orders with proud but temporally remote local histories; his extensive financial and technical support for the training of timekeepers (muwaqqits); and, perhaps most strikingly, his explicit and extensive patronage of Kurds, primarily from the area of Mosul, as teachers and students in his madrasa.

S	Fuertes-Olivera, PA; Velasco-Sacristan, M		HerreraSoler, H; White, M		Fuertes-Olivera, Pedro A.; Velasco-Sacristan, Marisol			Translating metaphor in business/economics dictionary articles: What the theory says and what lexicographers should do	METAPHOR AND MILLS: FIGURATIVE LANGUAGE IN BUSINESS AND ECONOMICS	Applications of Cognitive Linguistics		English	Article; Book Chapter							INTERNATIONAL-BUSINESS; ENGLISH	Metaphors have been extensively investigated since the publication of Metaphors We Live by. For example, the role metaphors play in framing political and economic discourse, the translatability of metaphors, and the different translation procedures have been the object of analysis of many researchers. This chapter adds to the current state of play by explaining some of the decisions made when translating the English Accounting Dictionary into Spanish (Fuertes-Olivera et al. 2010) and offers an explanation of the influence of English as lingua franca in the introduction of metaphorical terms into Spanish. For example, the term sunk cost should be rendered verbatim [Spanish: coste hundido] instead of paraphrastically 'costes en los que se ha incurrido en un proyecto, que no pueden cambiarse por acciones actuales o futuras', (Garcia Villalon and Martinez Barbeitio 2008) for two reasons. Firstly, as language planners, translators are always introducing novel metaphors in a target language (Fuertes-Olivera and Pizarro-Sanchez 2002). Secondly, the verbatim rendering facilitates the understanding of the metaphorical scenario in itself. Verbatim renderings of terminological metaphors assume that experts have previously come across the term, i.e., sunk cost in English and have understood it within the conceptual scenario where the term was created. The decisions taken can be explained within the agent models, i.e., approaches that analyze the people who produce the translated texts and engage in the translation processes (Dam and Zethsen 2009), proposed by scholars such as Chesterman (2009), who claim that Translator Studies consist of three branches: cultural, cognitive and sociological, and Fuertes-Olivera (2011), who has assumed a literal effect hypothesis in the translation of terms.

This growing interest in measuring sentiment coincides with a dramatic increase in the volume of digitized information. Computer automation has a great deal of potential in this new media environment. The objective here is to outline and validate a new automated measurement instrument for sentiment analysis in political texts. Our instrument uses a dictionary-based approach consisting of a simple word count of the frequency of keywords in a text from a predefined dictionary. The design of the freely available Lexicoder Sentiment Dictionary (LSD) is discussed in detail here. The dictionary is tested against a body of human-coded news content, and the resulting codes are also compared to results from nine existing content-analytic dictionaries. Analyses suggest that the LSD produces results that are more systematically related to human coding than are results based on the other available dictionaries. The LSD is thus a useful starting point for a revived discussion about dictionary construction and validation in sentiment analysis for political communication.

J	Kallas, J; Tuulik, M				Kallas, Jelena; Tuulik, Maria			THE BASIC DICTIONARY OF ESTONIAN: THE HISTORICAL CONTEXT AND THE PRINCIPLES OF COMPILATION	EESTI RAKENDUSLINGVISTIKA UHINGU AASTARAAMAT			Estonian	Article						learner's dictionary; morphology; word formation; syntagmatic relations; lexico-semantic relations; Estonian as a second language	ENCODING DICTIONARIES; COLLOCATION; COLLIGATION	The paper describes in an historical perspective what kind of information is presented in entries of Estonian-Russian learners' dictionaries on the level of morphology, word formation, syntagmatic relations and lexico-semantic relations. To achieve the aim of the study nine learners' dictionaries, which were published during the last 160 years, were investigated. The analysis of the Estonian-Russian learners' dictionaries indicated that dictionary compilers provide dictionary users mostly with information about inflectional formation and the Russian equivalent; meanwhile, information about word formation, syntagmatic and lexico-semantic relations is neglected or presented implicitly. For this reason, analyzed dictionaries can be classified mostly as passive dictionaries (i. e. for understanding of texts). On the other hand, learners' dictionaries meant for speakers of Estonian as a first language provide much more information concerning inflectional formation, word formation, synonyms, antonyms, paronyms-all of which is presented explicitly. The information on syntagmatic relations is presented mostly implicitly by means of examples at the level of phrases, clauses and sentences. The analysis revealed that there is a need to elaborate new format for explicit presentation of word formation, syntagmatic and lexico-semantic information in learners' dictionaries of Estonian Language as a Second Language. In order to achieve this goal and in view of positions taken by modern theoretical lexicography on what kind of information should explicitly be presented in a production dictionary, the authors elaborated the basic principles of compilation of the corpus-based productive Basic Dictionary of Estonian. This dictionary will supply users with pronunciation, emotional valence, inflectional, word formation information, government structures, lexical collocations, idioms, synonyms, antonyms and paronyms. The usage of government structures, lexical collocations and idioms will be illustrated by means of example sentences.

Classical Arab lexicography describes as "rank, station, or dignity, with, or in the estimation of, the ", but texts extracted from biographical literature show that is also linked to the possession of wealth, noble genealogical descent ( though this is not always a necessary requisite), and above all, the existence of a system of distribution and circulation of favours, both material and symbolic, between possessors of and persons close to them. A significant tradition is identified, through which the term gradually acquires a religious character, since it was considered by some to be subject to the payment of. Examples of the " misuse" of by Andalusi 'ulama' are also provided. In conclusion, it is proposed on the basis of numerous examples that the concept of belonged to a secular semantic field, and that its use in the biographies of 'ulama' reveals the growing involvement of such scholars in the sphere of political and economic power.

J	Peterson, D				Peterson, David			Neoliberal Homophobic Discourse: Heteronormative Human Capital and the Exclusion of Queer Citizens	JOURNAL OF HOMOSEXUALITY			English	Article						hate speech; homophobic discourse; homophobic language; neoliberalism		In this article, I examine the relationship between homophobic language use and its broader social context, focusing on how a U.S.-based, conservative Christian organization's institutionalized homophobic text-making practices seek to derive legitimacy from the broader political economic discourses associated with the neoliberal moment. Using the Family Research Council's statement on marriage and the family as the basis for analysis, I demonstrate how the organization seeks to represent lesbian and gay subjects and their kinship formations as a threat to human capital development because they are based on affectional relationships that neither reflect nor respond to the kinds of self-governance and marketization that neoliberalism requires of all citizen-subjects and their families. Linguistic strategies for creating such representations include lexical choices that avoid overtly identifying lesbian and gay subjects as the object of discussion, the creation of a taxonomy for what constitutes "proper" families-based on neoliberal principles-that implicitly excludes lesbian and gay kinship formations, and the use of neoliberal discourses of self-governance and marketization as the basis for that exclusion.

I examine how a US-based, conservative Christian organization deploys an order of discourse that, through a logic of deviancy, enables homophobic formation to unfold. Text-making strategies include hybridizing generic features derived from social science writing generally and deviancy studies particularly, allowing institutional writers to claim scientific legitimacy for their antigay representations. Stylistically, lexical choice promotes an objective tone, while assertion and modalization buttress antigay representations. Discursive strategies include calculated ascriptions and denials of gay/lesbian agency, and the harnessing of hyponymy, synonymy and antonymy to create a taxonomy of deviancies reinforcing antigay evaluations while avoiding overt homophobic references. My findings suggest that the institution's order of discourse enables homophobic understandings that appear grounded in scientific truth. These institutional practices are motivated by a desire to naturalize governance claims as part of a broader hegemonic struggle over the definition of the good (sexual) citizen and the political direction of the United States.

They aim to solve communicative problems in a number of specific Situations in which tourists wish to engage in conversation. However, they also have to deal with the absence of the necessary listening and speaking skills of their users. The lexicographic information is normally twofold, as it includes a selection of relevant words and sentences as well as a selection of the grammatical rules that govern the integration of these words and sentences into tourist conversation - from words to utterances so to speak. In this article, we will focus on the selection and presentation of the grammatical data in order to investigate how they contribute to the fulfilment of their primary functions. Our thesis is that the grammatical data have to deal with a dilemma: helping tourists understand and be understood during a conversation while also helping them acquire some basic knowledge of the grammatical system of the foreign language.

Although lexical recognition is successful for 75% to 90% of word forms (depending on the type of text), some categories of words remain unrecognized. In this paper we present two aspects of e-dictionary enhancement that provide for additional recognition of two important categories of words: named entities and words generally not recorded in traditional dictionaries. We first describe the structure and content of dictionaries of proper names, both personal and geographic, developed to recognize the corresponding classes of named entities. Then we present a set of lexical transducers expressing morphological rules governing word formation, developed for the recognition of unknown words. The resources presented significantly improve the lexical recognition process.

J	Oteiza, T				Oteiza, T			How contemporary history is presented in Chilean middle school textbooks	DISCOURSE & SOCIETY			English	Article						appraisal analysis; history textbooks; ideology; Systemic Functional Grammar; textual analysis; textual and interpersonal metafunctions		This article provides a textual analysis of the pedagogical discourse of history textbooks used in the education of Chilean students. In particular, I focus on how the impact of Salvador Allende's socialist government (1970-1973) and the military coup that led to the Augusto Pinochet's dictatorship (1973-1990) are constructed by and displayed in these texts. As a method of analysis, I apply the Systemic Functional Grammar theory to history textbooks used in the sixth and eighth grades. Two of the metafunctions proposed by Halliday-textual and interpersonal-are particularly relevant when combined with an appraisal analysis fundamentally based on the work of Martin because they provide a useful tool for interpreting and explaining the text from an ideological standpoint. The analysis reveals that the textbooks' authors strive to sound objective, but instead offer a large number of explicit and implicit judgements throughout the text. They purport to present two antithetical political positions-that of Allende's supporters and that of the supporters of the military coup-however, the texts do not actually offer two clear positions nor do they provide clear reasons for the events. Instead, the authors obscure content through grammatical and lexical choices-such as the use of 'and' as an expression of reason or cause; embedded mental and verbal projection (sixth grade only); the absence of logico-semantic relationship of elaboration; and modal adjuncts that signal judgement but not explanation. Appraisal analysis in conjunction with a more discrete grammatical analysis is useful for revealing the explicit, subjective choices made in constructing these supposedly objective texts.

J	Mohr, M				Mohr, M			Defining dirt: Three early modern views of obscenity	TEXTUAL PRACTICE			English	Article						obscenity; civility; dictionaries; Thomas Elyot; Desiderius Erasmus; George Puttenham		This essay examines the workings of bad language in the early modern period, along with its social and political contexts--why and under what circumstances some words were deemed inappropriate for polite or moral discourse and literature. In early modern English, words such as 'shit' or 'fuck' were not considered 'swearing', but rather occupied a separate category of 'wanton' or 'obscene' language. Thomas Elyot's The Boke Named the Governour, Desiderius Erasmus' De Copia and George Puttenham's The Arte of English Poesie pay particular attention to this category. They investigate it from different perspectives, but reach similar conclusions: obscene words have an offensive power in excess of their literal meaning, exposing body parts and actions that should be concealed to a greater degree than do their more decorous synonyms. These texts also agree that the rules of decorum which govern obscenity are extremely flexible, so much so that obscene words may be the most useful and even the most appropriate terms in certain circumstances.										26	2	2	0	7	ROUTLEDGE TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD	ABINGDON	4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND	0950-236X			TEXTUAL PRACT	Textual Pract.

Two different approaches have traditionally applied to syntactic analysis: constituent grammars and dependency grammars. We propose a model for syntactic analysis and disambiguation combining lexical dependencies and semantic proximity. Lexical dependencies are applied by means of a government pattern dictionary following the dependency approach. The semantic proximity is introduced by means of semantic closeness among constituents.

J	vonDornum, DD				vonDornum, DD			The straight and the crooked: Legal accountability in ancient Greece	COLUMBIA LAW REVIEW			English	Article								The question of how to ensure the accountability of governmental officials is one of the fundamental dilemmas of American democracy. Concern with accountability is hardly novel; indeed, the ancient Greeks were obsessed with keeping their officials legally accountable for their actions in office. Scholars have studied the complex legal mechanisms developed by fifth century B.C.E. Athenians for controlling official actions. A connection between concern with accountability and a democratic system of government has been presumed, because the vast majority of the extant historical evidence is from fifth century Athens. In fact, historians have seen accountability as a product of democracy. However, this Note shows that the systems and ideology of accountability existed in Greece long before democracy emerged: as early as the eighth century B.C.E. accountability is perceptible as a political and cultural value. This Note employs archaic poetic texts to trace the development of accountability from the eighth to the sixth centuries B.C.E. Concentrating on one accountability institution, the ''euthyna,'' the author traces the shifts in the ideology of ''straightness'' and ''crookedness'' of officials over three centuries through thematic and dictional links. The author shows the evolution of legal accountability from its pre-democratic archaic form, an informal aristocratic reckoning, to ifs democratic form, a stringently regulated mechanism in which the entire citizen body could participate.

J	Reveilhac, M; Morselli, D				Reveilhac, Maud; Morselli, Davide			Dictionary-based and machine learning classification approaches: a comparison for tonality and frame detection on Twitter data	POLITICAL RESEARCH EXCHANGE			English	Article						Text analysis; dictionary-based approach; machine learning; democracy frames; tonality detection	SOCIAL MEDIA; TEXT	Automated text analysis methods have made it possible to classify large corpora of text by measures such as frames and tonality, with a growing popularity in social, political and psychological science. These methods often demand a training dataset of sufficient size to generate accurate models that can be applied to unseen texts. In practice, however, there are no clear recommendations about how big the training samples should be. This issue becomes especially acute when dealing with texts skewed toward categories and when researchers cannot afford large samples of annotated texts. Leveraging on the case of support for democracy, we provide a guide to help researchers navigate decisions when producing measures of tonality and frames from a small sample of annotated social media posts. We find that supervised machine learning algorithms outperform dictionaries for tonality classification tasks. However, custom dictionaries are useful complements of these algorithms when identifying latent democracy dimensions in social media messages, especially as the method of elaborating these dictionaries is guided by word embedding techniques and human validation. Therefore, we provide easily implementable recommendations to increase estimation accuracy under non-optimal condition.

Lexical bundles in formulaic interpreting A corpus-based descriptive exploration	TRANSLATION AND INTERPRETING STUDIES			English	Article; Early Access						4-gram lexical bundles; consecutive interpreting corpus; frequency patterns; formulaicity	LANGUAGE; ENGLISH; SPOKEN; SPEAKERS	Inspired by Henriksen (2007), this article investigates some key characteristics of formulaic interpreting, understood as the recurrent use of linguistic formulae in interpreted texts. Using a Chinese-English corpus of consecutive interpreting in the political setting (CICPPC), the study quantitatively investigates some features of 4-gram lexical bundles in interpreted text, i.e., their discourse functions and relationships to the source text, and qualitatively studies characteristics of specific instances of lexical bundles. The patterns are described both in terms of equivalence, shifts, and additions, as well as 'constraints on formulaicity,' a generalization that captures the tension involved between frequency-driven selection and the need to establish a translational relationship. It is suggested that equivalence typical of form-based rendition and addition typical of meaning-based rendition are subject to lower constraints, while greater constraints pertain in the case of shifts.

J	Nguyen, D; Hekman, E				Nguyen, Dennis; Hekman, Erik			A 'New Arms Race'? Framing China and the U.S.A. in A.I. News Reporting: A Comparative Analysis of the Washington Post and South China Morning Post	GLOBAL MEDIA AND CHINA			English	Article						artificial intelligence; China-USA rivalry; digital transformation; news media; framing	RELIABILITY; FRAMES	This study explores the news framing of A.I., China, and the U.S.A. in two mainstream news outlets: The Washington Post and The South China Morning Post. The main objective is to analyse how both, as parts of different discourse cultures, portray the competition for leadership in A.I. innovation between China and the U.S.A. The study takes a critical look at the media discourse on the 'new arms race' and what role the news play in localising global technology trends. The empirical part makes use of a combination of manual and automated content analyses. To this end, a dictionary approach that utilises Names Entity Recognition was applied to a large volume of news texts (N = 3.055) to identify recurring news frames. The findings show similarities in the perception of A.I.'s potentials and versatility but also clear cultural differences in how risks and conflicts are portrayed in both outlets. Although the Washington Post appears more critical about A.I., the South China Morning Post frames the technology as a driver of economic growth and global influence. The discussion offers a starting point for theorising the relationship between mediatisation, tech trends, cultural differences, and international politics.

An Analysis of the Relationship between the Reading Skills of Low-SES Children, Their Oral Vocabulary and English Input in the Classroom in Government Schools in India	APPLIED LINGUISTICS			English	Article; Early Access							LEXICAL DIVERSITY; LEARNING ENGLISH; LANGUAGE; COMPREHENSION; L2; KNOWLEDGE; EDUCATION; LITERACY; TEXT; CHALLENGES	The aim of the study was to find out to what extent low socio-economic status (SES) children enrolled in government-run primary schools in Hyderabad are ready to receive instruction through the medium of English (English medium instruction [EMI]). To this end we investigated children's oral vocabulary skills, the lexical complexity of their textbooks, as well as the amount of English input they receive in class. A subsample of 90 children from primary school Grades 4 and 5 who opted to carry out a story retelling task in English rather than in Telugu took part in the study. Results reveal that the children's oral vocabulary levels are far below the levels required to read the textbook materials. The lexical diversity of the children's stories as analysed with the Index of Guiraud was also a significant predictor of their reading comprehension scores. We conclude that children from low-SES enrolled in government schools are not ready for EMI, and call for further investigation into the levels of English vocabulary knowledge that are needed for EMI.

J	Li, ZT; Jia, J; Chapple, LJ				Li, Zhongtian; Jia, Jing; Chapple, Larelle J.			Textual characteristics of corporate sustainability disclosure and corporate sustainability performance: evidence from Australia	MEDITARI ACCOUNTANCY RESEARCH			English	Article; Early Access						Asset4; Corporate sustainability; Corporate social responsibility; Diction 7; Linguistic analysis; Readability; Sustainability disclosure; Sustainability performance; Tone of language	ANNUAL-REPORT READABILITY; SOCIAL-RESPONSIBILITY; ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE; NONFINANCIAL DISCLOSURE; GOVERNANCE; CSR; ENDOGENEITY; LEGITIMACY; COMPLEXITY; TONE	Purpose This study aims to analyze whether various textual characteristics in corporate sustainability disclosure associate with corporate sustainability performance in Australia, pertaining to tones of language and readability. The voluntary disclosure theory and legitimacy theory are used to formulate the study hypothesis. Design/methodology/approach Using data from Australian listed firms (2002-2016), four textual characteristics are examined: tone of optimism, tone of certainty, tone of clarity and readability. Corporate sustainability performance is measured by Thomson Reuters Asset4 ratings. Different strategies are adopted to mitigate endogeneity concerns. Findings The authors found that there is a positive relationship between the textual characteristics of sustainability disclosure and sustainability performance. Specifically, firms with better performance communicate in an optimistic, certain, clear and more readable manner. Practical implications The results suggest that Australia's voluntary reporting status does not induce a combination of poor performance and positive disclosure. This paper should be of interest to investors and other stakeholders and also informs regulatory policy on sustainability disclosure in Australia. Originality/value The authors contribute to the sustainability disclosure literature using computer-based textual analysis to explore whether firms reveal their sustainability performance by "how things are said" (i.e. textual characteristics) in sustainability disclosure. As far as the authors could ascertain, they are the first to investigate textual characteristics of sustainability disclosure in Australia.

J	Li, ZL; Tang, J				Li, Zhenli; Tang, Jian			Analysis on the Influencing Factors and Countermeasures of Publicity Translation Communication Effect Based on Text Type Theory	WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS & MOBILE COMPUTING			English	Article							AQUEOUS-SOLUTION; DEGRADATION; MODEL	The impact of publicity translation and communication is a critical link in China's international public relations strategy. The primary goal of the critical task of "disseminating Chinese culture and transmitting China's image" is to improve Sino-foreign cooperation and ensure that the world understands and recognizes China. It entails the movement and spread of various cultural elements across countries, and it affects every aspect of human society. It is a necessary means of communication between people, nations, and countries. We should take into account many differences between the East and the West in terms of language, culture, ideology, and so on when translating. The tone of the text is determined, and the writing is concise, which aims to analyze ideas, clarify viewpoints, and achieve the purpose of publicity, among the factors affecting the communication effect of publicity translation. It possesses qualities, such as accuracy, politics, timeliness, monosemy, objectivity, and integrity, among others. This paper will investigate the characteristics of the factors affecting the communication effect of publicity translation and text types from the lexical and syntactic levels, as well as the specific application of text type theory in the communication effect of publicity translation.

J	Wang, YW; He, Z; Hu, J				Wang, Yiwen; He, Zhi; Hu, Jie			Traffic Information Mining From Social Media Based on the MC-LSTM-Conv Model	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Social network services; Feature extraction; Roads; Data mining; Machine learning; Dictionaries; Monitoring; Sina Weibo; convolution neural networks; long short-term memory; traffic jam	FACE	Social media (e.g., Sina Weibo) have the advantage of reflecting traffic information, including the reasons for jams, illegal behaviors, and emergency recourses on roads. However, there remains a challenging issue regarding how to sufficiently mine traffic information. In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based method that uses social media data for traffic jam management. The core ideas of the proposed method are twofold. First, a multichannel network with a Long Short-Term Memory layer (LSTM-layer) and a Convolution layer (Conv-layer) (termed as MC-LSTM-Conv) is proposed. This model consists of two information channels for extracting abstract features from input text. Each channel includes two Conv-layers, and an LSTM-layer is added to one of the four Conv-layers. The MC-LSTM-Conv model is used to extract check-in microblogs reflecting traffic jams from mass Sina Weibo data. Second, a series of matching rules are constructed based on the keywords that are related to traffic-jam scenes. These rules further classify the microblogs extracted by the first step into four classes, and each of the classes reflects a specific road condition (i.e., traffic accidents or large-scale activities, road construction, traffic lights, and the low efficiency of government agencies). Experiments on Sina Weibo data demonstrate that the proposed multichannel network has superior performance in extracting microblogs about traffic jams. The keyword fuzzy matching method can fetch detailed information about traffic jams efficiently.

J	Alotaibi, FL; Alhammad, MM				Alotaibi, Fatimah L.; Alhammad, Muna M.			Using a Rule-based Model to Detect Arabic Fake News Propagation during Covid-19	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED COMPUTER SCIENCE AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Fake news; Covid-19; text classification; rule-based system; trends		Since the emergence of the Covid-19, both factual and false information about the new virus has been disseminated. Fake news harms societies and must be combated. This research aims to identify Arabic fake news tweets and classify them into six categories: entertainment, health, politics, religious, social, and sports. The study also aims to uncover patterns in the spread of Arabic fake news associated with the Covid-19 pandemic. The researchers created an Arabic dictionary and used text classification based on a rule-based system to detect and categorize fake news. A dataset consisting of 5 million tweets was analyzed. The developed model achieves an overall accuracy of 78.1% with 70% precision and 98%recall. The model detected more than 26006 fake news tweets. Interestingly we found an association between the number of fake news tweets and dates. The result demonstrates that as more information and knowledge about Covid-19 become available over time, people's awareness increase, while the number of fake news tweets decreases. The categorization of false news indicates that the social category was highest in all Arab countries except Palestine, Qatar, Yemen, and Algeria. Conversely, fake news related to the entertainment category was the weakest dissemination in most Arab countries.

J	Basanta, A; Vangehuchten, L				Basanta, Almudena; Vangehuchten, Lieve			Sustainability reports of Chilean, Spanish and Mexican companies: a critical genre analysis	CIRCULO DE LINGUISTICA APLICADA A LA COMUNICACION			English	Article						Critical genre analysis; Genre hybridization; Sustainability report; Corporate Social Responsibility communication in the hispanic world	CORPORATE-SOCIAL-RESPONSIBILITY; GOVERNANCE ENVIRONMENT; FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE; CSR; INFORMATION; STRATEGIES; LEGITIMACY; INSIGHTS; LINK	This article presents a critical genre analysis of the sustainability report in three of the main dialectological variants of the Spanish language, namely Chilean, Mexican and peninsular Spanish, which also correspond to three areas with different levels of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) implementation. The corpus consists of the reports of six companies in the extractive and financial sectors, which are particularly sensitive to sustainability and face great challenges in achieving a balance between people, planet and profit. We assume that CSR discourse is a hybrid form of business communication which, in addition to its primary informational role, performs the communication functions of legitimising the company's actions, managing its reputation and establishing a sustainable dialogue with stakeholders. Through a lexical-semantic discursive analysis that makes use of topic modelling, the reports of the three sub-corpuses are compared and it is concluded that in the peninsular sub-corpus CSR communication is mainly of a strategic nature, while in the Chilean and Mexican sub-corpus it is also clearly responsive, which can be explained from a transcultural and institutional perspective. As for the interdiscourses that serve to reinforce the general CSR discourse, it is striking that the Chilean and Mexican reports make significantly more use of the communication strategies of legitimacy and reputation, so that they clearly want to exploit the report's promotional potential more than seems to be the case in the peninsular subcorpus. Finally, when taking into account the extra-textual factors, it can be seen that the strategy of omission also has an important influence on the discourse of this genre.

The aim of this article is to analyse the media impact in the Spanish press of both the news about the request for the report (2018) and the report itself (2020) and to demonstrate how the information focused by the headlines, the lexical selection, the elements of assessment and the people who interact in them can condition public opinion and further contribute to the polarisation of the existing debate between Academia and Feminism. For this purpose, we have analysed a corpus of 216 Spanish digital press texts obtained from the DISMUPREN database. The analysis shows that ideological biases exist not only in opinion journalism, but also in the news.

Sentiment Analysis in Hindi-A Survey on the State-of-the-art Techniques	ACM TRANSACTIONS ON ASIAN AND LOW-RESOURCE LANGUAGE INFORMATION PROCESSING			English	Article						Sentiment analysis; hindi language; opinion mining; lexicon technique; systematic review	INDIAN LANGUAGES; CLASSIFICATION; ARCHITECTURE	Sentiment Analysis (SA) has been a core interest in the field of text mining research, dealing with computational processing of sentiments, views, and subjective nature of the text. Due to the availability of extensive web-based data in Indian languages such as Hindi, Marathi, Kannada, Tamil, and so on. It has become extremely significant to analyze this data and recover valuable and relevant information. Hindi being the first language of themajority of the population in India, SA in Hindi has turned out to be a critical task particularly for companies and government organizations. This research portrays a systematic review specifically in the field of Hindi SA. The major contribution of this article includes the categorization of numerous articles based on techniques that have attracted researchers in performing SA tasks in Hindi language. This survey classifies these state-of-the-art computational intelligence techniques into four major categories namely lexicon-based techniques, machine learning techniques, deep learning techniques, and hybrid techniques. It discusses the importance of these techniques based on different aspects such as their impact on the issues of SA, levels of analysis, and performance evaluation measures. The research puts forward a comprehensive overview of the majority of the work done in Hindi SA. This study will help researchers in finding out resources such as annotated datasets, linguistic resources, and lexical resources. This survey delivers some significant findings and presents overall future research directions in the field of Hindi SA.

Social media is a platform for people to express their feelings, feedback, and opinions. To understand the sentiment context of the text, sentiment analysis plays the role to determine whether the sentiment of the text is positive, negative, neutral or any other personal feeling. Sentiment analysis is prominent from the perspective of business or politics where it highly impacts the strategic decision making. The challenges of sentiment analysis are attributable to the lexical diversity, imbalanced dataset and long-distance dependencies of the texts. In view of this, a data augmentation technique with GloVe word embedding is leveraged to synthesize more lexically diverse samples by similar word vector replacements. The data augmentation also focuses on the oversampling of the minority classes to mitigate the imbalanced dataset problems. Apart from that, the existing sentiment analysis mostly leverages sequence models to encode the long-distance dependencies. Nevertheless, the sequence models require a longer execution time as the processing is done sequentially. On the other hand, the Transformer models require less computation time with parallelized processing. To that end, this paper proposes a hybrid deep learning method that combines the strengths of sequence model and Transformer model while suppressing the limitations of sequence model. Specifically, the proposed model integrates Robustly optimized BERT approach and Long Short-Term Memory for sentiment analysis. The Robustly optimized BERT approach maps the words into a compact meaningful word embedding space while the Long Short-Term Memory model captures the long-distance contextual semantics effectively. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed hybrid model outshines the state-of-the-art methods by achieving F1-scores of 93%, 91%, and 90% on IMDb dataset, Twitter US Airline Sentiment dataset, and Sentiment140 dataset, respectively.

J	Feng, X; Wang, X; Zhang, Y				Feng, Xin; Wang, Xu; Zhang, Yue			Research on public emotional polarization and public opinion evolution of OTC and learning during the COVID-19 epidemic: taking the topic of OTC on Zhihu as an example	LIBRARY HI TECH			English	Article; Early Access						COVID-19; Online teaching and learning; Public emotional polarization; Public opinion evolution; Emotional analysis; Time series analysis		Purpose The outbreak and continuation of COVID-19 have spawned the transformation of traditional teaching models to a certain extent. The Chinese Ministry of Education's guidance on "keep learning and teaching during class suspension" has made OTC and learning (OTC) become routinized, and the public's emotional attitudes toward OTC have also evolved over time. The purpose of this study is to segment the emotional text data and introduce it into the topic model to reveal the evolution process and stage characteristics of public emotional polarity and public opinion of OTC topics during public health emergencies in the context of social media participation. The research has important guiding significance for the development of OTC and can influence and improve the efficiency and effect of OTC to a certain extent. The analysis of online public opinion can provide suggestions for the government and media to guide the trend of public opinion and optimize the OTC model. Design/methodology/approach This paper takes the topic of "OTC" on Zhihu during the COVID-19 epidemic as an example, combined with the characteristics of public opinion changes, chooses Boson emotional dictionary and time series analysis method to build an OTC network public opinion theme evolution analysis framework that integrates emotional analysis and topic mining. Finally, an empirical analysis of the dynamic evolution of the communication network for each stage of the life cycle of a specific topic is realized. Findings This paper draws the following conclusions: (1) Through the emotional value table and the change trend chart of the number of comments, the analysis found that the number of positive comments is greater than the number of negative comments, which can be inferred that the public gradually accepts "OTC" and presents a positive emotional state. (2) By observing the changing trend of the average daily emotional value of the public, it is found that the overall emotional value shows a stable development trend after a large fluctuation. From the actual emotional value and the fitted emotional value curve, it can be seen that the overall curve fit is good, so ARIMA (12, 1, 6) can accurately predict the dynamic trend of the daily average emotional value in this paper. Therefore, based on the above-mentioned public opinion, emotional analysis research, relevant countermeasures and suggestions are put forward, which is conducive to guiding the development direction of public opinion in a positive way. Originality/value Taking the topic of "OTC" in Zhihu as an example, this paper combines Boson emotional dictionary and time series to conduct a series of research analyses. Boson emotional dictionary can analyze the public's emotional tendency, and time series can well analyze the intrinsic structure and complex features of the data to predict the future values. The combination of the two research methods allows for an adequate and unique study of public emotional polarization and the evolution of public opinion.

J	Cabezas-Garcia, M; Chambo, S				Cabezas-Garcia, Melania; Chambo, Santiago			Multi-word term variation Prepositional and adjectival complex nominals in Spanish	REVISTA ESPANOLA DE LINGUISTICA APLICADA			English	Article						multi-word term; complex nominal; denominative variation; relational adjective; co-text; specialized language	LANGUAGE	Complex nominals (CNs) are frequently found in specialized discourse in all languages, since they are a productive method of creating terms by combining existing lexical units. In Spanish, a conceptual combination may often be rendered with a prepositional CN (PCN) or an equivalent adjectival CN (ACN), e.g., demanda de electricidad vs. demanda electrica [electricity demand]. Adjectives in ACNs - usually derived from nouns - are known as 'relational adjectives' because they encode semantic relations with other concepts. With recent exceptions, research has focused on the underlying semantic relations in CNs. In natural language processing, several works have dealt with the automatic detection of relation adjectives in Romance and Germanic languages. However, there is no discourse studies of these CNs, to our knowledge, for the goal of establishing writer recommendations. This study analyzed the co-text of equivalent PCNs and ACNs to identify factors governing the use of a certain form. EcoLexicon ES, a corpus of Spanish environmental specialized texts, was used to extract 6 relational adjectives and, subsequently, a set of 12 pairs of equivalent CNs. Their behavior in co-text was analyzed by querying EcoLexicon ES and a general language corpus with 20 expressions in CQP-syntax. Our results showed that immediate linguistic co-text determined the preference for a particular structure. Based on these findings, we provide writing guidelines to assist in the production of CNs.

Various policy comments on them have fully demonstrated the basic characteristics of big data. This paper introduces knowledge graphs into the sentiment analysis, analyses and sorts out the policy comments of China's mainstream social media platforms from 2016 to 2019, build a sentiment analysis dictionary, and then use the policy comments evaluation system to form sentiment knowledge graphs of policy comments that includes seven sentiments and five themes. The process of the sentiment knowledge graph constructed in this paper helps to more accurately understand the changes of online public opinion, and provides a theoretical basis for local governments to adjust the implementation of various policies. Apart from being the prototype of the automated sentiment knowledge graph system for policy comments, it can also be applied to other related hot topics.

J	Alqmase, M; Al-Muhtaseb, H; Rabaan, H				Alqmase, Mohammed; Al-Muhtaseb, Husni; Rabaan, Habib			Sports-fanaticism formalism for sentiment analysis in Arabic text	SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS AND MINING			English	Article						Sports-fanaticism; Opinion mining; Social networks; Text mining; Sentiment analysis; Natural language processing		Social media sites become a common means for sports fans to communicate. Understanding how social text contributes to increase or decrease sports-fanaticism is essential. The sports-fanaticism is a psychological emotion that carries a blind hatred (hatred for no reason) against the competitive teams combined with a blind love toward the favorite teams. It is one of the social problems that have negative impacts on the social fabric. Fanatic attitudes are controlled by sentiment where emotional attitudes overcome mental attitudes. This paper aims to formulate the sports Arabic text into fanatic and anti-fanatic contexts to build a classification model using sentiment analysis. Sentiment analysis is a field of artificial intelligence that uses natural language processing, computational linguistics, and text analysis to systematically identify, extract, and analyze people's sentiment. The proposed classification model is built to automatically classify Arabic social texts into a fanatic and anti-fanatic emotion. The methodology is sequentially described as follows: First, social text is formalized into twenty-one fanatic and anti-fanatic contexts. Second, fanatic lexicon with 1780 terms is developed. Third, 919 K domain-specific tweets are collected and labeled. Fourth, machine learning algorithms are applied to build a classification model. As a result, we have developed a classification tool that automatically evaluates, and classifies a given Arabic text against sports-fanaticism. Such a tool and model will help social sites to automatically filter messages posted by visitors to avoid sports-fanaticism. This research is a primary work to automatically detect religious fanaticism, political fanaticism, and other forms of fanaticism that have a negative impact on society.

In this paper, we propose a novel weakly supervised probabilistic topic model, Joint Issue-Sentiment-Stance Topic (JISST) model, for stance detection from political opinion in social media. The model automatically identifies the target issue and stance toward the target issue simultaneously from the text. Unlike other machine learning approaches to stance classification which require labelled data for training classifiers, JISST requires only a small number of seed words for each issue and stance and a sentiment lexicon. The model is evaluated on two datasets in the political domain: a Facebook dataset which contains posts of politically motivated Facebook groups in Australia and a Twitter dataset which was published for the SemEval 2016 competition. Experimental results demonstrate that JISST outperforms both weakly supervised and supervised baselines for stance and issue classification.

However, the proposition made here requires a summary and the assessment of different semantic concepts led by the idea of commonality.

In doing so, a historiography relating to the subject-matter of "semantics" will be suggested that assigns a semantic bridging function to Late Antiquity / Early Medieval Latin in relation to all languages of Latin Europe.

During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, social media sites play a crucial role in people communicating, sharing, and expressing their perceptions on various topics. Analyzing such textual data can improve the response time of governments and organizations to act on alarming issues. This study aims to perform sentiment analysis on the subject of COVID-19 vaccination, perform temporal and spatial analyses of the textual data, and find the most frequently discussed topics that may help organizations bring awareness to those topics. In this work, the sentiment analysis of tweets was performed using 14 different machine learning classifiers and natural language processing (NLP). Lexicon-based TextBlob and Vader are used for annotating the data. A natural language toolkit is used for preprocessing of textual data. Our analysis observed that unigram models outperform bigram and trigram models for all four datasets. Models using term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) have higher accuracy than models using count vectorizer. In the count vectorizer class, logistic regression has the best average accuracy with 91.925%. In the TF-IDF class, logistic regression has the best average accuracy of 92%; logistic regression has the highest average recall, F1-score, and ten cross-validation scores, and a ridge classifier has the highest average precision. The unigram models show a standard deviation (SD) of less than 1 for all classifiers except for the Gaussian Naive Bayes showing 1.18. The experimental results reveal the dates and times in which most positive, negative, and neutral tweets are posted.

This article focusses on legal translation, with its highly functional aims, by following the career of a pair of Indo-Persian legal forms known as tamassuk and fdrigh-khatti, used for recording obligation and requital respectively. Tracing their reincarnations from Persian into Marathi, Hindi and Bengali, this article reveals several forms of boundary-crossing: doctrinal, jurisdictional, political and linguistic. In doing so, it explores the legal mindscapes in the early modern Indo-Persian world, spilling from the late Mughal into the colonial, and shows how multilingualism functioned within specific parts of the Persianate cosmopolis.

Within a political ecology framework, our research questions the success story of water conservation. To do so, we conducted a quantitative textual analysis of 520 daily local press articles dealing with drought and water issues in Phoenix and Tucson (Arizona, USA). Using two open-access lexicometric software, our analysis traces the rise of the water conservation narrative in the press. Our results show how newspapers can become an instrument of public policies to work towards their social acceptance. Moreover, water conservation is framed as a consensual tool. It reassures that threats associated with water scarcity will be successfully managed to sustain urban growth in arid regions. In this sense, water conservation operates following a logic of fix, in line with the successive hydrosocial fixes that helped the development of arid lands and does not question inherited power structures in water management.

J	Kettunen, K; La Mela, M				Kettunen, Kimmo; La Mela, Matti			Semantic tagging and the Nordic tradition of everyman's rights	DIGITAL SCHOLARSHIP IN THE HUMANITIES			English	Article; Early Access								This article uses semantic tagging to analyse the Nordic concept of everyman's rights (a right of public access to nature) in protocols of the Finnish parliament. In the analysis, we use a novel tool, a lexical semantic tagger for Finnish (Finnish-language Semantic Tagger), which is used to tag key discussions about everyman's rights in the Finnish parliament. The article has two contributions as follows: first, it presents a method that combines semantic tagging and similarity analysis of corpora (keyness) for studying the formation of political concepts in large textual data. Secondly, it sheds light on the Nordic access rights and the underlying customary everyman's rights. Despite its central role in public debate, the history of the concept has not been well researched. Our analysis shows that the legislative context could be clearly detected with our approach, and that the method allowed us to describe shifts in the meaning of everyman's rights in the legislative discussion.

J	Banbhrani, SK; Xu, B; Liu, HF; Lin, HF				Banbhrani, Santosh Kumar; Xu, Bo; Liu, Haifeng; Lin, Hongfei			SC-Political ResNet: Hashtag Recommendation from Tweets Using Hybrid Optimization-Based Deep Residual Network	INFORMATION			English	Article						deep learning; hashtag recommendation; long short-term memory; natural language processing; sine cosine algorithm; text classification; tweet modeling; word embedding		Hashtags are considered important in various real-world applications, including tweet mining, query expansion, and sentiment analysis. Hence, recommending hashtags from tagged tweets has been considered significant by the research community. However, while many hashtag recommendation methods have been developed, finding the features from dictionary and thematic words has not yet been effectively achieved. Therefore, we developed an effective method to perform hashtag recommendations, using the proposed Sine Cosine Political Optimization-based Deep Residual Network (SC-Political ResNet) classifier. The developed SCPO is designed by integrating the Sine Cosine Algorithm (SCA) with the Political Optimizer (PO) algorithm. Employing the parametric features from both, optimization can enable the acquisition of the global best solution, by training the weights of classifier. The hybrid features acquired from the keyword set can effectively find the information of words associated with dictionary, thematic, and more relevant keywords. Extensive experiments are conducted on the Apple Twitter Sentiment and Twitter datasets. Our empirical results demonstrate that the proposed model can significantly outperform state-of-the-art methods in hashtag recommendation tasks.

J	O' Hagan, LA				O' Hagan, Lauren Alex			Commercialising public health during the 1918-1919 Spanish flu pandemic in Britain	JOURNAL OF HISTORICAL RESEARCH IN MARKETING			English	Article						Marketing history; Public health; Misinformation; Great Britain; Advertisements; Spanish flu	INFLUENZA; CONSUMER; POLITICS	Purpose This paper aims to use the advertisements of three major brands - Chymol, Formamint and Lifebuoy Soap - to examine how advertisers responded to the 1918-1919 influenza pandemic in Great Britain influenza pandemic. It looks particularly at the ways in which marketing strategies changed and how these strategies were enacted in the lexical and semiotic choices (e.g. language, image, colour, typography, texture, materiality, composition and layout) of advertisements. Design/methodology/approach A total of 120 advertisements for the three brands were collected from the British Newspaper Archive and analysed using the theory and analytical tools of multimodal critical discourse analysis. The general themes and semiotic structures of the advertisements were identified, with the aim of deconstructing the meaning potentials of verbal and visual resources used to convey ideas about the pandemic, and how they work to shape public understanding of the products and make them appear as effective and credible. Findings Each brand rapidly changed their marketing strategy in response to the influenza pandemic, using such techniques as testimonials, hyperbole, scaremongering and pseudoscientific claims to persuade consumers that their products offered protection. Whilst these strategies may appear manipulative, they also had the function of fostering reassurance and sympathy amongst the general public in a moment of turmoil, indicating the important role of brands in building consumer trust and promoting a sense of authority in early twentieth-century Britain. Originality/value Exploring the way in which advertisers responded to the 1918-1919 influenza pandemic reminds us of the challenges of distinguishing legitimate and illegitimate medical advice in a fast-moving pandemic and highlights the need to cast a critical eye to the public health information, particularly when it comes from unofficial sources with vested interests.

One illustrative example is the discussion that has taken place on introducing mandatory mask-wearing to contain the coronavirus. In this context, this study investigates how the communication of uncertainty regarding the effectiveness of mandatory mask-wearing affects the perceived trustworthiness of communicators. Participants (N = 398) read a fictitious but evidence-based text supporting mandatory mask-wearing. First, epistemic uncertainty was communicated by including a high (vs. low) amount of lexical hedges (LHs) to the text (e.g., "maybe"). Second, we varied whether the source of information was a scientist or a politician. Thereafter, participants rated the source's trustworthiness. Results show that the scientist was perceived as more competent and as having more integrity but not as more benevolent than the politician. The use of LHs did not impact trustworthiness ratings.

J	Zhao, YN; Xing, FG; Fan, MR; Li, H; Zhu, TS				Zhao, Yanan; Xing, Fugui; Fan, Miaorong; Li, Hua; Zhu, Tingshao			Psycho-Linguistic Changes Associated With Historical Celebrities in Henan Using Classical Chinese Big Data	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						psycho-linguistic changes; Henan historical celebrities; CC-LIWC; classical Chinese big data; classical Chinese words segmentation system	DECEPTION; WORDS	Chinese civilization has a long history, and the Central Plains, with Henan as the core, is one of its birthplaces. Understanding the psycho-linguistic changes in Henan is of great significance for understanding the evolution and formation of national cultural psychology. The traditional method is mainly qualitative or speculative, which makes the consistency among the research results low. Moreover, because most of the research are conducted in a specific period or on a specific figure, they are relatively scattered and unsystematic. To systematically and quantitatively study the psychological changes in the Central Plains represented by Henan Province, this article aimed to examine the self-reported discourses of historical celebrities in Henan in official history and their psycho-linguistic changes based on the classical Chinese Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (classical Chinese LIWC, CC-LIWC) psycholinguistic dictionary and the classical Chinese words segmentation system, using big data. The research found that the frequency of male words in Henan historical celebrities (F = 2.938, p < 0.05), of differ words (F = 4.767, p < 0.01), of motion words (F = 4.042, p < 0.01), and of time words (F = 5.412, p < 0.01) are significantly different among the five dynasties. The conclusion is that during the Spring and Autumn and the Warring States periods, 100 schools of thought contended, and the status of "scholars" in Henan rose. The frequency of male and differ words was at that point significantly higher than during the other dynasties. From "The Contention of a Hundred Schools of Thought" to "The Supremacy of Confucianism," the scholars in Henan were in decline, and differential cognitive tendencies had diminished since the Han dynasty. During the period of the Three Kingdoms and Jin and Southern and Northern Dynasties, political powers and territories changed, and the historical celebrities in Henan show a remarkable tendency that were related to time and space. The psycho-linguistic changes found in this study are highly consistent with the development of social history, which indicates that the guidance of the social, political, and cultural environment has an important influence on the psycho-linguistic changes of social class. This is the first time that the text analysis system has been applied in classical Chinese to carry out quantitative research on the psycho-linguistic changes of ancient Chinese people, which provides new ideas and new methods for humanistic research.

Based on psycholinguistic research, this paper analyzes the Chinese and American media's news reports and comments on the COVID-19. It aims to expose the hidden psychological messages and ideologies behind the words. The corpus in this paper is mainly from the official media of China Daily and Time from December 2019 to January 2021 in China and the United States. This paper uses Wang Zhenhua's Appraisal Theory and Halliday's Systemic Functional Grammar as tools to make a comparative analysis of the corpus. At the textual level, languages are classified and lexical choices are analyzed followed by the analysis of the reporter's ideology after reviewing the motivation of the reporters of two countries. On the level of social responsibility expression and discourse, the paper analyzes the news reports, which are characterized by the combination of the reporter's views on the news. In the aspect of social practice, the social and cultural factors and background of news reports are analyzed. China calls for strengthening cooperation and exchanges with other countries to jointly fight the epidemic. The Chinese government has actively shared its experience and made corresponding contributions to international economic recovery. However, the US government shirks its responsibility by claiming that the effective implementation of Chinese methods and experience in China does not mean that it can achieve corresponding results in Europe and the US. At the same time, the United States provides medical supplies to other countries. This study hopes to help awaken readers' critical thinking and increase their awareness of the anti-control of mass discourse. At the same time, it is hoped that readers can view the epidemic from a more scientific perspective, understand the facts and reject the unwarranted panic. It will also help reshape Chinese and American discourse.

We employ both the Word2Vec technique and the dictionary method to measure the aggregate textual tone in the media news. Based on a sample of publicly listed A-share firms in China, we document that media-based sentiment is positively (negatively) related to the cross-section of stock returns over a short (long) horizon. Further analysis shows that higher information quality, measured by more analyst coverage, better audit opinions and non-governmental ownership could mitigate the effects of sentiment. Overall, our findings imply that media news contains important information for measuring the overall investor sentiment that drives the future stock price up in the short term and then down in the long term.

The main research question was: How was the theme of unity conveyed in this particular speech through linguistic choices? The significance of this work lies in the fact that this specific speech has not been subjected to academic linguistic investigation to date. In addition, this speech is unique as it came to mark the beginning of the new presidency with a direct focus on unity as a recurring theme. The methodology adopted a qualitative analytical analysis of the concept of unity as referred to in this speech. The study followed a thematic analysis in approaching the speech text. The researchers scrutinized every utterance for clues on the possible linguistic features that portrayed the theme of unity conveyed by the speaker. They also examined the lexical items concerning the concept of unity in the speech. The results showed that the speaker used appropriate language in addressing the theme of unity. The speaker used religion and history as a source of rhetorical persuasive devices. The overall tone of the speech was confident, reconciliatory, and hopeful. The study concluded with some implications for pedagogy and academic research.

J	Janssen, DF				Janssen, Diederik F.			'On the different Species of Phobia' and 'On the different Species of Mania' (1786): from popular furies to mental disorders in America	MEDICAL HUMANITIES			English	Article								Benjamin Rush's twin 1786 letters on the different species of phobia and mania sit at an extended historical juncture at which an early modern quasi-medical troping of mental disorder in American social commentary sobered up to mental medicine. The letters' satirical drive hinged on a perennial problem still occupying George Beard almost a century onward: which idiosyncratic trepidation or ill-grounded idea warranted the nomination of national and epochal ill? Rush's mania letter exemplified an established genre identifying popular and especially political crazes; at the same time, it foreshadowed the early 19th-century rise and mid-century fall of monomania as forensic-nosological stopgap. The phobia text established the term's dictionary (OED) sense of specific morbid fears, but did so in the form of a mobilisation of nosological jargon for social diagnostics purposes: an ambivalent prelude to Rush's later formal engagement with unreasonable fears and follies. Both letters draw attention to a pervasive duality in early modern and Enlightenment conceptions of hydrophobia, aerophobia, syphilophobia and lyssophobia, between public-health and mental-hygienic follies.

The experiment, 200 respondents from Volgograd and Tyumen involved two stages: first, the degree of names recognition was determined, second, the level of reproducibility of these names in a figurative meaning was identified. Socio-political situation changes tend to lead to significant semantic shifts in the meaning of well-known connotative names. Of particular relevance is the postSoviet period, a new stage in the history of modern Russia, due to having affected both the economic and political processes in the country and the value priorities of Russian society reflected in the language of the last three decades. Psycholinguistic methods for studying lexical semantics, namely, the method of addition and synonymous replacement and the method of restoring incomplete utterance, were applied to establish the features of understanding and reproducibility of connotative names of the post-Soviet period by native speakers of the Russian language. The results allow ranking the names according to the degree of recognition (low, medium, or high) and marking the levels of reproducibility (names with stable or lost connotations). The regional and age peculiarities of understanding and reproducing the connotative names of the post-Soviet period are noted. The prospects and relevance of the lexicographic description of the connotative names are determined.	[Kryukova, I., V; Vrublevskaya, O.

The research of conceptual metaphor within the framework of translation studies is a relatively new and unexplored field in Lithuanian linguistics. Since SPORT metaphors are especially popular in political communication, the cases where sport in public discourse is considered as a visualization of policies and related areas are frequently investigated. The aim of the research was to reveal translation strategies used for the translation of SPORT metaphors from English to Lithuanian in audiovisual discourse related to SPORT. The research revealed that four translation strategies, namely: word for word translation, substitution, paraphrase, complete omission and retention were employed by the translators. The results of the research also demonstrated, that the most frequent source domain for the sport metaphors was WAR, which was the most frequently preserved using word for word translation strategy. In the case of other translation strategies, either the source domain was substituted in the translated text, or, in the majority of cases, the metaphorization was escaped. The target domain SPORT was represented similarly in both the source and the target languages, either implicitly by a larger context, or explicitly by lexical units containing a semantic element "related to SPORT". The research revealed that while choosing the translation strategy for the translation of conceptual metaphors, three key factors should be taken into consideration, such as cultural, cognitive and sociological factors. Conceptual metaphors are an inseparable part of SPORT and they reveal in what terms SPORT can be defined in a particular culture. In order to understand how conceptual metaphors are perceived and what ideas are conveyed it is necessary to analyse the way they are transferred from the source culture to the target one.

The digitization of legislative transcripts has increased the potential application of established tools for the automated analyses of emotion in text. Unlike in writing, however, expressing emotion in speech involves intonation, facial expressions, and body lan- guage. Drawing on a new dataset of annotated texts and videos from the Canadian House of Commons, this paper does three things. First, we examine whether transcripts capture the emotional content of speeches. We find that transcripts capture sentiment, but not emotional arousal. Second, we compare strategies for the automated analysis of sentiment in text. We find that leading approaches performed reasonably well, but sentiment dictionaries generated using word embeddings surpassed these other approaches. Finally, we test the robustness of the approach based on word embeddings. Although the methodology is reasonably robust to alternative specifications, we find that dictionaries created using word embeddings are sensitive to the choice of seed words and to training corpus size. We conclude by discussing the implications for analyses of political speech.

J	Smith, LT				Smith, Laura T.			Textuality in a Jazz Aesthetic: Textual Rituals for Transformation in Sharon Bridgforth's love conjure/blues	MELUS			English	Article								This article argues that Suzan-Lori Parks' Pulitzer-prize winning play Topdog/Underdog (1999) mobilizes a conspiracy theory concept of anti-black violence in America. The highly discursive play depicts a pair of black brothers named Lincoln and Booth as they banter, argue, and compete with each other over games of three-card monte. In the final scene of the play, the brothers fulfil the destiny inscribed in their names: Booth shoots and kills his brother Lincoln after a dispute over their meager inheritance. The play frames this final act of brutal fratricide as a form of political assassination in order to activate the rescaling that comes with a conspiracy theory lexicon: Topdog/Underdog formulates a generative and radically resistant conspiratorial conception of anti-black violence that ultimately enables a genuine confrontation with the origins and structures of racialized oppression. The play thus belongs to a lineage of works by black writers that have wielded a paranoid aesthetic in order to galvanize a revolutionary opposition to the structures of racial oppression. This tradition includes authors such as W. E. B. Du Bois, Richard Wright, and, most explicitly, John A. Williams, whose novel The Man Who Cried I Am (1967) emerges in the article as a precedent for the conspiratorial racial politics of Parks's play. In its own interpretation of paranoid anti-racist critique, Topdog/Underdog elaborates a concept of conspiracy without intentionality whose hierarchies, despite being beyond the parameters of any single individual or collective entity's agency, can nonetheless be undermined and, ultimately, toppled.

Political sentiment analysis is used when a data analyst wants to determine the opinion of different users on social media platforms regarding a politician or a political event. This paper presents Athena Political Popularity Analysis (AthPPA), a tool for identifying political popularity over Twitter. AthPPA is able to collect in-real-time tweets and for each tweet to extract metadata such as number of likes, retweets per tweet etc. Then it processes their text in order to calculate their overall sentiment. For the calculation of sentiment analysis, we have implemented a sentiment analyzer that is able to identify the grammatical issues of a sentence as well as a lexicon of negative and positive words designed specifically for political sentiment analysis. An analytic engine processes the collected data and provides different visualizations that provide additional insights on the collected data. We show how we applied our framework to the three most prominent Greek political leaders in Greece and present our findings there.

Using sentiment analysis, the implied emotion in the text can be mined effectively for different occasions. People are using social media to receive and communicate different types of information on a massive scale during COVID-19 outburst. Mining such content to evaluate people's sentiments can play a critical role in making decisions to keep the situation under control. The objective of this study is to mine the sentiments of Indian citizens regarding the nationwide lockdown enforced by the Indian government to reduce the rate of spreading of Coronavirus. In this work, the sentiment analysis of tweets posted by Indian citizens has been performed using NLP and machine learning classifiers. From April 5, 2020 to April 17, 2020, a total of 12 741 tweets having the keywords "Indialockdown" are extracted. Data have been extracted from Twitter using Tweepy API, annotated using TextBlob and VADER lexicons, and preprocessed using the natural language tool kit provided by the Python. Eight different classifiers have been used to classify the data. The experiment achieved the highest accuracy of 84.4% with LinearSVC classifier and unigrams. This study concludes that the majority of Indian citizens are supporting the decision of the lockdown implemented by the Indian government during corona outburst.

J	Mutinda, J; Mwangi, W; Okeyo, G				Mutinda, James; Mwangi, Waweru; Okeyo, George			Lexicon-pointed hybrid N-gram Features Extraction Model (LeNFEM) for sentence level sentiment analysis	ENGINEERING REPORTS			English	Article						feature selection; lexicon; minimum redundancy maximum relevance; N-gram2vec model; sentence level SA; sentiment classification; TF-IDF	CLASSIFICATION	Sentiment analysis of social media textual posts can provide information and knowledge that is applicable in social settings, business intelligence, evaluation of citizens' opinions in governance, and in mood triggered devices in the Internet of Things. Feature extraction and selection is a key determinant of accuracy and computational cost of machine learning models for such analysis. Most feature extraction and selection techniques utilize bag of words, N-grams, and frequency-based algorithms especially Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency. However, these approaches do not consider relationships between words, they ignore words' characteristics and they suffer high feature dimensionality. In this paper we propose and evaluate a feature extraction and selection approach that utilizes a fixed hybrid N-gram window for feature extraction and minimum redundancy maximum relevance feature selection algorithm for sentence level sentiment analysis. The approach improves the existing features extraction techniques, specifically the N-gram by generating a hybrid vector from words, Part of Speech (POS) tags, and word semantic orientation. The vector is extracted by using a static trigram window identified by a lexicon where a sentiment word appears in a sentence. A blend of the words, POS tags, and the sentiment orientations of the static trigram are used to build the feature vector. The optimal features from the vector are then selected using minimum redundancy maximum relevance (MRMR) algorithm. Experiments were carried out using the public Yelp dataset to compare the performance of the proposed model and existing feature extraction models (BOW, normal N-grams and lexicon-based bag of words semantic orientations). Using supervised machine learning classifiers the experimental results showed that the proposed model had the highest F-measure (88.64%) compared to the highest (83.55%) from baseline approaches. Wilcoxon test carried out ascertained that the proposed approach performed significantly better than the baseline approaches. Comparative performance analysis with other datasets further affirmed that the proposed approach is generalizable.

Linguistic tone of management discussion and analysis disclosures and the municipal debt market	JOURNAL OF PUBLIC BUDGETING ACCOUNTING & FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Municipal MD&A; Municipal bonds; GASB 34; Narrative disclosure	INFORMATION-CONTENT; TEXTUAL ANALYSIS; COST; RATINGS; IMPACT; PRESS	PurposeAs the management discussion and analysis (MD&A) section contains discretionary narrative disclosures regarding a government's yearly financial changes and status, the authors investigate several municipal debt market consequences of linguistic tone within these disclosures.Design/methodology/approachThe authors textually analyze municipal MD&As with Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) software and develop narrative tone measures based on existing financial-specific dictionaries. Using a final sample of 446 municipal bond issuances from 2012 to 2016, the authors modify the current bond regression models to examine the association between MD&A disclosure tone and future bond interest costs or rating disagreements.FindingsThis study's empirical analysis suggests that more negative MD&A tone is associated with higher future debt costs and greater future disagreements among bond rating agencies.Practical implicationsOverall, the evidence implies that municipal bond stakeholders use the information in narrative disclosures when evaluating risk, but that the qualitative nature can introduce differences in interpretation between users. Furthermore, additional training in MD&A writing and further standard guidance in MD&A disclosures could improve the MD&A's informativeness for bond market decision-making and state-level monitoring.Originality/valueThis study is first to incorporate narrative tone measures into bond models in a governmental context.

However, only a few studies have ever emphasized constructing financial domain sentiment lexicons, especially in a Chinese financial context. In light of this gap in research, the purpose of this study is to generate a Chinese financial domain sentiment lexicon (CFDSL). Then, that lexicon is applied to financial distress prediction (FDP). This study proposes a deep learning-based framework to construct a domain sentiment lexicon, employing words vector models and deep learning-based classifiers in the process. To evaluate the effectiveness of the CFDSL, this study applies the lexicon to analyzing annual reports; sentiment features are also regarded as predictive factors in FDP. The experiment results indicate that deep learning-based models can achieve satisfactory results in generating a CFDSL that mainly covers four aspects of sentiment words, including capital markets, stock markets, companies' internal business conditions and politics. This study also discovers that sentiment features that are calculated four years prior to the predicted benchmark year enable the optimum performance. In addition, CFDSL-based sentiment features show advantages in FDP, compared with other lexicons. This study makes a novel contribution to existing research, as it expands the method of constructing financial domain sentiment lexicons. This paper also provides new findings that can have significant implications for the provision of early warning signals of Chinese listed companies' financial risk.

J	Supicic, I				Supicic, Ivan			INITIATION OF THE DEPARTMENT OF MUSICOLOGY AT THE ACADEMY OF MUSIC IN ZAGREB - FROM PERSONAL MEMORIES TO GENERAL CONTEXT	ARTI MUSICES			Croatian	Article						Zagreb Academy of Music; Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences; musicology; 1970; Josip Andreis		This introductory speech on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the Department of Musicology at the Academy of Music in Zagreb presents the author's memories of the people who participated in the foundation of the Department. It also outlines the circumstances which prevailed at the time and the time preceding the foundation, the "prehistory" of the Department. The main and most meritorious initiators responsible for the Department's foundation were Josip Andreis, Milo Cipra, Marijan Koletic and Kresimir Kovacevic, with the active participation of the author of this text. Professor Andreis played an essential role in this event as the head of the then Department of History and Theory at the Academy, also being the most prominent music historian in Croatia at the time and, inter alia, being the author of several books on general and Croatian music history, as well as the editor-in-chief of the first edition of the Muzicka enciklopedija [Music Encyclopaedia] (1958-1963) published by the Lexicographic Institute in Zagreb. The launch of the Department, then called the Division, was immediately preceded by the foundation of a small research centre called the "Musicological Institute" at the Academy, which also provided professional and technical support to two important journals launched at the time: Arti musices (in Croatian), which dealt primarily with Croatian music, and the International Review of the Aesthetics and Sociology of Music / IRASM (in English, German and French), which dealt with pluridisciplinary questions regarding music in general. That was an important basis for the establishment of the Department, giving it added value and strength. The then atmosphere, a consequence of the emergence of the reformist political movement "Croatian Spring", was in favour of undertaking these research, publishing and teaching-educational projects. It happened in spite of the present threat of the ruling Yugoslav communist political regime, which at its discretion easily made ideological accusations in the field of art sciences, including education, for alleged nationalism and clericalism, formalism and non-Marxism. These jeopardies were successfully evaded during the inception of the Department of Musicology, naturally with some self-censorship. The initiative to start the Department was, after all, marked by an effort to achieve greater freedom in this area, but also in science in general. Moreover, musicology has proven itself not only as an independent and autonomous science of specific values, but also as an ancilla musicae, a scientific discipline in the service of learning and valuing music and the art of music, with special regard to their highest achievements and accomplishments.

J	Catanzaro, A				Catanzaro, Andrea			Widening the idea of profit in the Hobbesian eight bookes of the Peloponnesian Warre?	HISTORY OF EUROPEAN IDEAS			English	Article; Early Access						Hobbes; Thucydides; profit; justice; safety		Scholars have analysed in-depth the famous three greatest things linking Thomas Hobbes and Thucydides. As is well known, the ideas of fear, honour and profit - that is, time, deos (and phobos) and opheleia (or opheleia) - play a fundamental role in showing the latter's influences on the former. With particular regard to ophelia it has been suggested that it has to be conceived 'as economic advantage or interest' [Slomp Gabriella, 'Hobbes, Thucydides and the Three Greatest Things', History of Political Thought 11 (1990): 565-86]. Since Thucydides' lexicon uses several words in addition to opheleia to express the idea of profit, the essay, through a comparative lexical analysis of the original Greek text and its Hobbesian translation, will take these into consideration, in order to find out if they can provide us with elements capable of widening the above definition. All this to better clarify the notion of profit, a notion that is truly crucial in Hobbes' political thought.

J	Bartlomiejczyk, M				Bartlomiejczyk, Magdalena			Interpreting nonmainstream ideology (Euroscepticism) in the European Parliament	PERSPECTIVES-STUDIES IN TRANSLATION THEORY AND PRACTICE			English	Article; Early Access						Simultaneous interpreting; European Parliament; ideological shifts; CDA; interpreter agency	TRANSLATION	The paper investigates possible ideological shifts introduced by interpreters during plenary debates in the European Parliament when dealing with strongly Eurosceptic statements. The material undergoing this discourse analysis are Polish and English plenary contributions by a highly controversial politician, Janusz Korwin-Mikke, and the corresponding interpretations into the other language of this pair. The focus is on his Eurosceptic credo which appears at the end of many speeches and on a specific lexical label, i.e. explicit ideological elements that reoccur often in the corpus and, consequently, possess numerous interpreted versions. There is some evidence of strengthening, weakening, elimination and omission of Euroscepticism, while the trend towards reduction and suppression seems stronger than the reverse. The detected shifts are discussed against the backdrop of the constraints inherent in simultaneous interpreting and the strategies routinely used by interpreters to overcome difficulties in the source text.

Our dataset consisted of the introduction sections of 500 published research articles from Anthropology, Applied Linguistics, Political Science, Psychology, and Sociology. All texts in the dataset were manually annotated for rhetorical moves and steps by a team of seven researchers using an extensively adapted version of Swales' (2004) revised Create a Research Space (CARS) model. Our rhetorical and phraseological analysis of the corpus revealed substantial disciplinary variation in both the distribution of rhetorical move-steps and the associations between phrase-frames and rhetorical move-steps among the five social science disciplines. Our findings contribute to a better understanding of disciplinary variation in the rhetorical and linguistic features of research article writing and have useful implications for academic writing research and pedagogy.

J	Gjerstad, O; Flottum, K				Gjerstad, Oyvind; Flottum, Kjersti			Climate change lifestyle narratives among Norwegian citizens: A linguistic analysis of survey discourse	EUROPEAN POLICY ANALYSIS			English	Article						climate change; lifestyle; linguistics; narratives; polyphony		The present study proposes an analysis of climate change (CC) narratives in answers to an open-ended survey question, where we ask what a climate-friendly lifestyle may imply. The representative survey has been conducted online by the Norwegian Citizen Panel/DIGSSCORE, located at the University of Bergen. The survey provided 1,149 answers from respondents across Norway. The analysis combines a lexical and a text linguistic approach (Flottum & Gjerstad, 2017), based on Adam's (2008) analysis of the narrative text sequence (initial situation-complication-(re)action-resolution-final situation), and inspired by the Narrative Policy Framework's (NPF) notions of plot and narrative characters (Jones et al., 2014). Our analysis identified four main topics: consumption, transportation, politics, and energy, while the cast of characters is dominated by the first-person singular, frequently portrayed as hero, and the first-person plural in a predominantly villainous role. The frequent use of negation and argumentative connectives reflects the contentious nature of the issue.

This often requires filtering corpora for complex research concepts. The commonly used off-the-shelf filtering techniques are untested at this task. Dictionaries may not recognize language outside of investigators' expectations and thresholding on topic proportions from topic models may fail to identify brief references to concepts. We develop a typology of texts as they relate to a research concept and use this to structure a filtering procedure. We compare our procedure's performance with dictionary-only and topic-proportion-only approaches on two corpora-government speeches and academic articles-and two research concepts-housing crisis and inequality. Our procedure outperforms overall and on each type of relevant text in the typology. An open-source software package is available for implementing the procedure. This provides researchers with a more structured and tested approach for filtering text data. Additionally, the types-of-text typology analysis provides a unique examination of what constitutes a filtered dataset, allowing researchers to consider how conclusions may be affected.

This paper examines the lexical properties of IR following the introduction of the International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC) Framework. Using an international sample, we find that when adopted voluntarily, IR are lengthier, use more complex language, and contain more boilerplate statements. Our findings suggest that without regulation, firms may continue to produce long and difficult to understand reports in fear of being perceived as omitting "bad news." This fear might be justified as we find loss of analyst following and greater analyst uncertainty when voluntarily adopted IR is concise. In the regulated setting of South Africa, however, we find IR has become more concise, and firms that produce longer and more complex documents suffer from a deterioration of their information environment. Our findings suggest that regulators and practitioners need to be cognizant of the potential for an increased volume in reporting to obfuscate the message rather than inform stakeholders.

J	Weiss, M; Zoorob, M				Weiss, Max; Zoorob, Michael			Political frames of public health crises: Discussing the opioid epidemic in the US Congress	SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE			English	Article						Opioid; Addiction; US politics; Text analysis; Framing	OVERDOSE PREVENTION; LANGUAGE; WORDS	When and how do politicians talk about public health crises? Using evidence from the opioid crisis in the United States, this paper assembles and analyzes novel data on Congressional statements to explore the conditions under which politicians (1) issue public statements about opioids and (2) frame the opioid crisis as a predominantly public health or law enforcement problem. We examined 3.8 million Congressional floor speeches and 111,000 public statements to identify (1) floor speeches about drug crises in the 97th to 114th Congresses (1981-2017) and (2) public statements about the opioid crisis in the 116th Congress (2019-2020). Moderate ideology, women, greater overdose deaths, and larger white populations are associated with significantly higher frequencies of opioid statements. Using a dictionary-based text analysis approach, we find that ideologically liberal and African American legislators are more likely to use public health framing, while ideologically conservative members are more likely to use law enforcement framing and refer to national borders or foreign countries in opioid statements. Democrats/liberals more often referenced medication treatment for opioids. These findings imply two broader conclusions about the nature of political discourse in public health crises. First, that political extremists are least likely to talk about opioids suggests that increasing partisan polarization may result in less discussion, emphasis, and expertise in public health issues. Second, the tenor of discourse about opioids and other public health crises is likely to change with partisan electoral waves, potentially hindering long term planning of public health capacity.

Re-engaging master narratives: Re-encountering Shakespeare's The Tempest in Esiaba Irobi's Sycorax	JOURNAL OF COMMONWEALTH LITERATURE			English	Article						African drama and theatre; chromatism and genitalism; Esiaba Irobi; race; sexuality; Shakespeare; Sycorax; The Tempest	DISCOURSE; DRAMA	Just like Aime Cesaire's Une tempete, Esiaba Irobi's Sycorax is a parallel narrative of Prospero's encounter with characters of other skin colour and gender. Both plays, like many others, represent successful efforts in countering the hitherto master narrative, Shakespeare's The Tempest. They speak back to and destabilize it through different versions that, at once, query and mitigate Shakespeare's. Using the idea of counter-narrative and writing back, Sycorax is interrogated here through textual analysis and selective close reading with a view to examining its exhumation and foregrounding of the silences, elisions, and under- or misrepresentations of The Tempest. With a highly provocative diction - Irobi's language is sexually explicit, violent, abusive, and unsettling - and experimental, somewhat postmodernist, dramatic structure, Sycorax intertextually dramatizes the issues of race, enslavement, colonial domination, migration, and gender as well as sexuality. Its relocation of action from the Mediterranean to the Caribbean; resurrection of Sycorax; Caliban's able-bodiedness, revolutionary zeal, vociferousness and change of name to Caribbean; Ariel's piebald sexuality as a bisexual hermaphrodite with the liberty to jump from Prospero's bed to Sycorax's; and the questioning of Shakespeare himself to answer for his (mis)representations; all exemplify Irobi's redirection of action and the emergence of new protagonists out of the characters of The Tempest. This article sees Sycorax as part of the work of formerly-colonized writers and artists now engaged in the process of redefining their people, identity, and cultural realities in the face of the preponderant assault of more powerful cultures and narratives that often garble them. Irobi's politically incorrect, troubling, and highly charged play thus expresses the angst of finding oneself vilified simply on the basis of race, body, or sexuality.

The study focuses on the analysis of the construction in press reportage dealing with cultural, sports, financial, political and spot news in Present-Day English. On the basis of data retrieved from six different corpora, it is argued that the distribution of locative inversion in these texts is related to the degree of the writer's involvement in each text style. Results show that the more involved a text is, the more locative inversions may be expected. The study further demonstrates that the construction itself serves as a discourse marker through which the presence of the writer is encoded in these texts.

The Hongloumeng corpus is developed at the sentence level to facilitate co-occurrence of the source texts and the two corresponding translations. For this purpose, the three-word and four-word lexical bundles were first extracted and then analyzed with respect to the functional classification proposed by Biber et al. (2004). The results of the study show that Hawkes' translation is embedded with a greater number and variety of lexical bundles than the one by the Yang couple. The study also identified the differences between the two versions which can be traced back to the deployment of different translation strategies of the translators, appearing in turn to be influenced by the language backgrounds of the translators, the translation skopos and settings, and the social, political, and ideological milieu in which the translations were produced.

J	Milton, J; Hopwood, O				Milton, James; Hopwood, Oliver			Vocabulary loading in the Studio textbook series: a 40% decline in the vocabulary input for French GCSE	LANGUAGE LEARNING JOURNAL			English	Article; Early Access						Vocabulary; textbook vocabulary; GCSE French	LEARNERS; ENGLISH	The vocabulary content of the French MFL curriculum in England has received criticism (Hacker, M. 2008. Eleven pets and 20 ways to express one's opinion: the vocabulary learners of German acquire at English secondary schools. The Language Learning Journal 36, no. 2: 215-26; Tschichold, C. 2012. French vocabulary in Encore Tricolore: do learners have a chance? The Language Learning Journal 40, no. 1: 7-19) for its small size, lack of thematic variety, and poor pedagogical exploitation in textbooks. Studies also note the small vocabulary knowledge of learners in UK compared with other French learners, ostensibly at the same CEFR B1 level (David, A. 2008. Vocabulary breadth in French L2 learners. The Language Learning Journal 36, no. 2: 167-80; Milton, J. 2006b. Language lite: learning French vocabulary in school. Journal of French Language Studies 16, no. 2: 187-205). This study examines the vocabulary content of the Studio series of French textbooks, first published in 2010, to see whether this situation has improved. Analysis shows the vocabulary loading of the textbooks has fallen over 40% compared with the previous books analysed by Tschichold (2012. French vocabulary in Encore Tricolore: do learners have a chance? The Language Learning Journal 40, no. 1: 7-19). This indicates a significant decline in the standard of learning for GCSE French since the vocabulary size of learners is so closely associated with their overall language proficiency. There are problems too with the thematic variety of teaching, the regularity of input, and the recycling of the lexical content. We argue this results from the guidance of advisory bodies such as the National Centre for Excellence for Language Pedagogy (NCELP) and the latest curriculum design (Department for Education. 2015.

Further, the guidance of advisory bodies such as the National Centre for Excellence for Language Pedagogy (NCELP) and the latest curriculum design (Department for Education. 2021.

Several research branches have been developed to tackle the problem from different perspectives, including Natural Language Processing and Big Data analysis, with the goal of providing valuable resources to support decision-making in a wide variety of fields. In this paper, we propose a real-time domain-specific clustering-based event-detection approach that integrates textual information coming, on one hand, from traditional newswires and, on the other hand, from microblogging platforms. The goal of the implemented pipeline is twofold: (i) providing insights to the user about the relevant events that are reported in the press on a daily basis; (ii) alerting the user about potentially important and impactful events, referred to as hot events, for some specific tasks or domains of interest. The algorithm identifies clusters of related news stories published by globally renowned press sources, which guarantee authoritative, noise-free information about current affairs; subsequently, the content extracted from microblogs is associated to the clusters in order to gain an assessment of the relevance of the event in the public opinion. To identify the events of a day d we create the lexicon by looking at news articles and stock data of previous days up to d(-1) Although the approach can be extended to a variety of domains (e.g. politics, economy, sports), we hereby present a specific implementation in the financial sector. We validated our solution through a qualitative and quantitative evaluation, performed on the Dow Jones' Data, News and Analytics dataset, on a stream of messages extracted from the microblogging platform Stocktwits, and on the Standard & Poor's 500 index time-series. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposal in extracting meaningful information from real-world events and in spotting hot events in the financial sphere. An added value of the evaluation is given by the visual inspection of a selected number of significant real-world events, starting from the Brexit Referendum and reaching until the recent outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic in early 2020.

In particular, the economic content of such speeches affects the economy of countries and their financial markets. For this reason, we examine a novel dataset containing the economic content of 951 speeches stated by 45 US Presidents from George Washington (April 1789) to Donald Trump (February 2017). In doing so, we use an economic glossary carried out by means of text mining techniques. The goal of our study is to examine the structure of significant interconnections within a network obtained from the economic content of presidential speeches. In such a network, nodes are represented by talks and links by values of cosine similarity, the latter computed using the occurrences of the economic terms in the speeches. The resulting network displays a peculiar structure made up of a core (i.e. a set of highly central and densely connected nodes) and a periphery (i.e. a set of non-central and sparsely connected nodes). The presence of different economic dictionaries employed by the Presidents characterize the core-periphery structure. The Presidents' talks belonging to the network's core share the usage of generic (non-technical) economic locutions like "interest" or "trade". While the use of more technical and less frequent terms characterizes the periphery (e.g. "yield"). Furthermore, the speeches close in time share a common economic dictionary. These results together with the economics glossary usages during the US periods of boom and crisis provide unique insights on the economic content relationships among Presidents' speeches.

In the absence of vaccines and antivirals, several behavioral change and policy initiatives such as physical distancing have been implemented to control the spread of COVID-19. Social media data can reveal public perceptions toward how governments and health agencies worldwide are handling the pandemic, and the impact of the disease on people regardless of their geographic locations in line with various factors that hinder or facilitate the efforts to control the spread of the pandemic globally. Objective: This paper aims to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on people worldwide using social media data. Methods: We applied natural language processing (NLP) and thematic analysis to understand public opinions, experiences, and issues with respect to the COVID-19 pandemic using social media data. First, we collected over 47 million COVID-19-related comments from Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, and three online discussion forums. Second, we performed data preprocessing, which involved applying NLP techniques to clean and prepare the data for automated key phrase extraction. Third, we applied the NLP approach to extract meaningful key phrases from over 1 million randomly selected comments and computed sentiment score for each key phrase and assigned sentiment polarity (ie, positive, negative, or neutral) based on the score using a lexicon-based technique. Fourth, we grouped related negative and positive key phrases into categories or broad themes. Results: A total of 34 negative themes emerged, out of which 15 were health-related issues, psychosocial issues, and social issues related to the COVID-19 pandemic from the public perspective. Some of the health-related issues were increased mortality, health concerns, struggling health systems, and fitness issues; while some of the psychosocial issues were frustrations due to life disruptions, panic shopping, and expression of fear. Social issues were harassment, domestic violence, and wrong societal attitude. In addition, 20 positive themes emerged from our results. Some of the positive themes were public awareness, encouragement, gratitude, cleaner environment, online learning, charity, spiritual support, and innovative research. Conclusions: We uncovered various negative and positive themes representing public perceptions toward the COVID-19 pandemic and recommended interventions that can help address the health, psychosocial, and social issues based on the positive themes and other research evidence. These interventions will help governments, health professionals and agencies, institutions, and individuals in their efforts to curb the spread of COVID-19 and minimize its impact, and in reacting to any future pandemics.

National Planning Context as a Determining Factor for Local Discourse	PLANNING THEORY & PRACTICE			English	Article						National planning context; planning culture; comparative planning studies; planning institution; local planning discourse; discourse analysis		Local planning discourse is torn between three trends: the withdrawal of central governments from local issues, the rise of local expertise and powers, and the mobility of policies from one country to another. While these trends have an impact on local planning, their respective weight is left undiscussed. This paper analyses the textual discourse of 34 French and English local transport plans using textometry combined with the constitution of comparable lexical categories in two languages. Our results show that local discourses are shaped by the national context they belong to, and that no trace of transnational homogenisation is yet visible.

While the volume of studies conducted on sentiment analysis is rapidly expanding, these studies mostly address English language concerns. The primary goal of this study is to present state-of-art survey for identifying the progress and shortcomings saddling Urdu sentiment analysis and propose rectifications. Methods: We described the advancements made thus far in this area by categorising the studies along three dimensions, namely: text pre-processing lexical resources and sentiment classification. These pre-processing operations include word segmentation, text cleaning, spell checking and part-of-speech tagging. An evaluation of sophisticated lexical resources including corpuses and lexicons was carried out, and investigations were conducted on sentiment analysis constructs such as opinion words, modifiers, negations. Results and conclusions: Performance is reported for each of the reviewed study. Based on experimental results and proposals forwarded through this paper provides the groundwork for further studies on Urdu sentiment analysis. (C) 2020 THE AUTHORS.

Analyzing the relationship between text features and grants productivity	SCIENTOMETRICS			English	Article						Language analysis; Productivity; Grants productivity; Text analysis		Predicting the output of research grants is of considerable relevance to research funding bodies, scientific entities and government agencies. In this study, we investigate whether text features extracted from projects title and abstracts are able to identify productive grants. Our analysis was conducted in three distinct areas, namely Medicine, Dentistry and Veterinary Medicine. Topical and complexity text features were used to identify predictors of productivity. The results indicate that there is a statistically significant relationship between text features and grants productivity, however such a dependence is weak. A feature relevance analysis revealed that the abstract text length and metrics derived from lexical diversity are among the most discriminative features. We also found that the prediction accuracy has a dependence on the considered project language and that topical features are more discriminative than text complexity measurements. Our findings suggest that text features should be used in combination with other features to assist the identification of relevant research ideas.	[Tohalino, Jorge A. V.; Quispe, Laura V.

There is a mismatch between the request to demonstrate the impact and the current methodologies for impact assessment. This mismatch is particularly worrisome for the research in Social Sciences and Humanities. This paper gives a contribution by examining systematically a key element of impact, i.e. the social groups that are directly or indirectly affected by the results of research. We use a Text mining approach applied to the Research Excellence Framework (REF) collection of 6,637 impact case studies in order to identify social groups mentioned by researchers. Differently from previous studies, we employ a lexicon of user groups that includes 76,857 entries, which saturates the semantic field, permits the identification of all users and opens the way to normalization. We then develop three new metrics measuring Frequency, Diversity and Specificity of user expressions. We find that Social Sciences and Humanities exhibit a distinctive structure with respect to frequency and specificity of users.

This paper proposes a novel analytical framework to investigate the tourist sentiment changes between different attractions based on geotagged social media data. Our framework mainly focuses on visualizing the detailed sentiment changes of tourists and exploring the valuable spatiotemporal pattern of the sentiment changes in tourist flow. The tourists were first identified from social media users. Then, we accurately evaluated the tourist sentiment by constructing a Chinese sentiment dictionary, grammatical rule, and sentiment score. Based on the location information of social media data, we built and visualized the tourist flow network. Last, to further reveal the impact of attractions on the sentiment of tourist flow, the positive and negative sentiment profiles were generated by mining social media texts. We took Beijing, a famous tourist destination in China, as a case study. Our results revealed the following: (1) the temporal trend of tourist sentiment has seasonal characteristics and is significantly influenced by government control policies against COVID-19; (2) due to the impact of the attraction's historical background, some tourist flows with highly decreased sentiment strength are linked to attractions; (3) on the long journey to the attraction, the sentiment strength of tourists decreases; and (4) bad traffic conditions can significantly decrease tourist sentiment. This study highlights the methodological implications of visualizing sentiment changes during collective tourist movement and provides comprehensive insight into the spatiotemporal pattern of tourist sentiment.

J	Sopena, IG				Sopena, Inmaculada Gonzalez			Indications of lexical-semantic changes in the Arabisms of the Kingdom of Granada (1493-1612): the lexical competition between almadena and martillo	ONOMAZEIN			English	Article						lexical-semantic changes; Arabisms; Kingdom of Granada; history of Spanish lexicon; tools and construction		The objective of the present study is to analyze a couple of lexical items formed by an Arabism and a Romance voice (almadena and martillo) through a corpus of documents linked to the ancient Kingdom of Granada (i.e. the current provinces of Malaga, Almeria and Granada) in the late 15th century to 17th century. That documentation includes different types of texts as the correspondence of Hernando de Zafra or texts linked to the building construction at that time. Due to the historical, political, social and religious peculiarities of the Kingdom of Granada there is a persistence of lexicon of Arab origin over the above two centuries with regard to other Spanish-speaking territories. However, Arabic loanwords in Spanish lexicon are subjected to specialization processes or semantic restrictions, as exemplified in the case of almadena. This voice lexically competed with the Romance voice martillo, but, finally, the first one suffered a process of semantic restriction and it is actually cornered in some dialectal areas.

J	Thommen, HK; Swarbrick, K; Biedenweg, K				Thommen, Hailey Kehoe; Swarbrick, Karin; Biedenweg, Kelly			Mixed emotions associated with orca (Orcinus orca) conservation strategies	CONSERVATION SCIENCE AND PRACTICE			English	Article						emotion analysis; natural language processing; orca conservation		Orcas (Orcinus orca) are a charismatic species with multiple connections to local economies and culture in the Pacific Northwest. As such, emotions play a role in public perspectives and support for their conservation. This research presents the use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) emotion analysis to identify the basic emotions associated with written public responses to orca conservation proposals. We operationalized a multi-dimensional emotion lexicon using Python 3 programing to extract the frequency and density of each basic emotion in over 17,000 public comments specific to orca conservation submitted to the Washington state governor's office. We found that respondents held a mixture of emotions. Trust was most often associated with the belief that urgent actions by state government could help orca populations, joy was most associated with statements reflecting how healthy orcas are icons for healthy ecosystems upon which all depend, and sadness was associated with statements lamenting the death of individual orcas and population extinction. These results can help conservation managers understand why people might support or reject conservation actions and move past conservation social science that has prioritized the emotional domain of fear. Moreover, NLP provides descriptive emotion analyses of big text datasets within specific conservation contexts that can be further explored through qualitative analyses.

Specifically, this contribution's focus is on the exploration of shaping and sharing social representations about (im)migrants through communication via the social medium 'Twitter'. A total of 1,958 tweets (967 Italian and 991 English tweets) were analysed through Systeme Portable Pour L'Analyse Des Donnees Textuelles [Portable System for Textual Data Analysis]SPAD in two lexical correspondence analyses. The results show a dichotomous discourse organising a semantic space structured around five different factors for the two distinct Twitter corpora: both clearly show polarised social representations of 'immigrants-migrants', leading to exclusion-inclusion policies depending on the discursive agent's ideological affiliation in the Italian and the international political frame. Used as a propaganda tool, Twitter echoes the related pro- and anti-immigration polemical representations of opposite political leaders in posts that are positioned differently in relation to the progressive/conservative ideology.

One of the ways in which bias in news articles can be introduced is by altering word choice. Such a form of bias is very challenging to identify automatically due to the high context-dependence and the lack of a large-scale gold-standard data set. In this paper, we present a prototypical yet robust and diverse data set for media bias research. It consists of 1,700 statements representing various media bias instances and contains labels for media bias identification on the word and sentence level. In contrast to existing research, our data incorporate background information on the participants' demographics, political ideology, and their opinion about media in general. Based on our data, we also present a way to detect bias-inducing words in news articles automatically. Our approach is feature-oriented, which provides a strong descriptive and explanatory power compared to deep learning techniques. We identify and engineer various linguistic, lexical, and syntactic features that can potentially be media bias indicators. Our resource collection is the most complete within the media bias research area to the best of our knowledge. We evaluate all of our features in various combinations and retrieve their possible importance both for future research and for the task in general. We also evaluate various possible Machine Learning approaches with all of our features. XGBoost, a decision tree implementation, yields the best results. Our approach achieves an. F-1-score of 0.43, a precision of 0.29, a recall of 0.77, and a ROC AUC of 0.79, which outperforms current media bias detection methods based on features. We propose future improvements, discuss the perspectives of the feature-based approach and a combination of neural networks and deep learning with our current system.

In this study, we take a novel approach to understanding such panic buying during the pandemic using compensatory control theory (CCT), text analytics, and advanced data modelling. Using a big data set over 14 days from 24,153 Twitter users in Italy, we create dictionaries to capture CCT constructs and note the dates of two government announcements. We measure constructs in the longitudinal data and test the CCT model using generalized linear mixed models for both fixed effects and random variation across individuals and time. The results support CCT, with anxiety driving a lack of perceived control, moderated by effective government announcements, and a lack of perceived control leading to purchasing, negatively moderated by utilitarian qualities. The study demonstrates the benefit of the methods for studying social phenomena and for early warning of potential demand issues via social media.

J	Gasimov, Z				Gasimov, Zaur			Observing Iran from Baku: Iranian Studies in Soviet and Post-Soviet Azerbaijan	IRANIAN STUDIES			English	Article; Early Access						Azerbaijan; Soviet Union; Baku; Nizami; Iranian Azerbaijan; Nationalism		Azerbaijani national identity emerged in post-Persian Russian-ruled East Caucasia at the end of the nineteenth century, and was finally forged during the early Soviet period. After the fiasco of the short-lived independence period of 1918-20, Azerbaijan became Soviet. Soviet power then instrumentalized Azerbaijan for political and ideological penetration into Iran by galvanizing local separatist movements. Azerbaijani Iranology was shaped within Soviet oriental studies and put into service of Azerbaijani nation-building. Exiled Iranian communists found asylum in Baku, joined local research institutions, wrote the first Persian academic and school textbooks, and contributed to the translation of classic Persian poetry into Azerbaijani. Soviet Azerbaijani Iranologists were sent as translators to the Soviet missions to Iran and Afghanistan. After Azerbaijan regained independence in 1991, its Iranological infrastructure was represented by several departments at the National Academy of Sciences and the Iranian Studies Program at Baku State University. While the number of Persian classes at schools during the last three decades diminished, a new generation of post-Soviet Iranologists-those who studied in Iran-emerged. While Soviet Azerbaijani Iranologists never created a solid bilingual dictionary of Persian, several Persian-Azerbaijani and Azerbaijani-Persian dictionaries were published in the 2010s. Post-Soviet Azerbaijani Iranology is still trying to find its place within humanities in the transitional nation.

J	Mate, A; Sebok, M; Barczikay, T				Mate, Akos; Sebok, Miklos; Barczikay, Tamas			The effect of central bank communication on sovereign bond yields: The case of Hungary	PLOS ONE			English	Article							MONETARY-POLICY; MACROECONOMIC NEWS; TEXTUAL ANALYSIS; NATIONAL BANK; STOCK RETURNS; MARKETS; DETERMINANTS	In this article we investigate how the public communication of the Hungarian Central Bank's Monetary Council (MC) affects Hungarian sovereign bond yields. This research ties into the advances made in the financial and political economy literature which rely on extensive textual data and quantitative text analysis tools. While prior research demonstrated that forward guidance, in the form of council meeting minutes or press releases can be used as predictors of rate decisions, we are interested in whether they are able to directly influence asset returns as well. In order to capture the effect of central bank communication, we measure the latent hawkish or dovish sentiment of MC press releases from 2005 to 2019 by applying a sentiment dictionary, a staple in the text mining toolkit. Our results show that central bank forward guidance has an intra-year effect on bond yields. However, the hawkish or dovish sentiment of press releases has no impact on maturities of one year or longer where the policy rate proves to be the most important explanatory variable. Our research also contributes to the literature by applying a specialized dictionary to monetary policy as well as broadening the discussion by analyzing a case from the non-eurozone Central-Eastern region of the European Union.

J	Al-Laith, A; Alenezi, M				Al-Laith, Ali; Alenezi, Mamdouh			Monitoring People's Emotions and Symptoms from Arabic Tweets during the COVID-19 Pandemic	INFORMATION			English	Article						emotion detection; COVID-19; COVID-19 symptoms; text classification; arabic tweets		Coronavirus-19 (COVID-19) started fromWuhan, China, in late December 2019. It swept most of the world's countries with confirmed cases and deaths. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the virus a pandemic on 11 March 2020 due to its widespread transmission. A public health crisis was declared in specific regions and nation-wide by governments all around the world. Citizens have gone through a wide range of emotions, such as fear of shortage of food, anger at the performance of governments and health authorities in facing the virus, sadness over the deaths of friends or relatives, etc. We present a monitoring system of citizens' concerns using emotion detection in Twitter data. We also track public emotions and link these emotions with COVID-19 symptoms. We aim to show the effect of emotion monitoring on improving people's daily health behavior and reduce the spread of negative emotions that affect the mental health of citizens. We collected and annotated 5.5 million tweets in the period from January to August 2020. A hybrid approach combined rule-based and neural network techniques to annotate the collected tweets. The rule-based technique was used to classify 300,000 tweets relying on Arabic emotion and COVID-19 symptom lexicons while the neural network was used to expand the sample tweets that were annotated using the rule-based technique. We used long short-term memory (LSTM) deep learning to classify all of the tweets into six emotion classes and two types (symptom and non-symptom tweets). The monitoring system shows that most of the tweets were posted in March 2020. The anger and fear emotions have the highest number of tweets and user interactions after the joy emotion. The results of user interaction monitoring show that people use likes and replies to interact with non-symptom tweets while they use re-tweets to propagate tweets that mention any of COVID-19 symptoms. Our study should help governments and decision-makers to dispel people's fears and discover new symptoms associated with the symptoms that were declared by the WHO. It can also help in the understanding of people's mental and emotional issues to address them before the impact of disease anxiety becomes harmful in itself.

This study provides an exhaustive comparison of sentiment analysis methods, using a validation set of Dutch economic headlines to compare the performance of manual annotation, crowd coding, numerous dictionaries and machine learning using both traditional and deep learning algorithms. The three main conclusions of this article are that: (1) The best performance is still attained with trained human or crowd coding; (2) None of the used dictionaries come close to acceptable levels of validity; and (3) machine learning, especially deep learning, substantially outperforms dictionary-based methods but falls short of human performance. From these findings, we stress the importance of always validating automatic text analysis methods before usage. Moreover, we provide a recommended step-by-step approach for (automated) text analysis projects to ensure both efficiency and validity.	[van Atteveldt, Wouter; van der Velden, Mariken A. C.

Three groups emerged from the analysis: "spatial conditions for infection" (39.2% of the text segments); "disease outbreaks in prisons" (30,4%) and "public responsibility" (30,4%). Precarious conditions of prisons, high rate of infections and psychiatric illnesses, and lack of government assistance are issues that should be given special attention in order to formulate health promotion and prevention policies focusing on mental health in prison population.

However, until recently, it was primarily written in Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), which is the formal variant of Arabic. Social media platforms have changed the face of written Arabic where users converse freely in various dialects, thus offering a massive number of resources for the study of dialectal text. The Arabic dialects differ from MSA in morphology, syntax, and phonetics. Consequently, since the effectiveness of NLP tasks-like sentiment analysis-is dependent on the availability of representative resources, there is currently a great need for such resources in these dialects. In this paper, we present MARSA-the largest sentiment annotated corpus for Dialectal Arabic (DA) in the Gulf region, which consists of 61,353 manually labeled tweets that contain a total of 840 K tokens. The tweets were collected from trending hashtags in four domains: political, social, sports, and technology to create a multi-domain corpus. The importance of such a corpus is to facilitate the study of domain-dependent sentiment analysis in Arabic. In addition to this corpus, the annotators extracted indicator words to form affect lexicons for each domain. We draw insights from these lexicons regarding contextual polarity of certain words.

In political articles, it is difficult to understand and summarise the state or overall views due to the diversity and size of social media information. A number of studies were conducted in the area of sentiment analysis, especially using English texts, while Arabic language received less attention in the literature. In this study, we propose a detection model for political orientation articles in the Arabic language. We introduce the key assumptions of the model, present and discuss the obtained results, and highlight the issues that still need to be explored to further our understanding of subjective sentences. The main purpose of applying this new approach based on Rough Set (RS) theory is to increase the accuracy of the models in recognizing the orientation of the articles. We present extensive simulation results, which demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model over other algorithms. It is shown that the performance of the proposed approach significantly improves by adding discriminating features. To summarize, the proposed approach demonstrates an accuracy of 85.483%, when evaluating the orientation of political Arabic datasets, compared to 72.58% and 64.516% for the Support Vector Machines and Naive Bayes methods, respectively.

J	Antolicic, G				Antolicic, Gregor			p FROM OLYMPUS TO THE LANDFILL OF HISTORY AND BACK - SLOVENIAN VIEWS ON EMPEROR FRANCIS JOSEPH FROM THE END OF THE FIRST WORLD WAR TO THE BREAKUP OF YUGOSLAVIA	ACTA HISTRIAE			English	Article						Franz Joseph; imperial cult; Slovenes; textbook; oblivion; transformation; historical perception		During the life of Franz Joseph, the Slovenes were undoubtedly one of the most loyal nations to the emperor. Slovene devotion, having grown into a worship of the imperial cult, found expression at a great variety of festivities and commemorations marking the jubilees of the emperor's rule and his birthdays. However, their infinite allegiance began to crumble on the eve of the First World War, when in face of Franz Joseph's reluctance to pursue radical political reforms, it gradually gave way to national consciousness and the struggle for equality, especially among the younger generations of intellectuals and politicians. Nevertheless, the Slovenes would continue to consider Franz Joseph as the symbol of existence and the "Father of the Nation" until his death in 1916. General shortages and political crisis, which, combined with military defeats, culminated in the disintegration of Austria-Hungary at the end of the war, changed the perception of the former sovereign and above all his public image, now propagandized by the new authorities. In Hinko Smrekar's caricature, Franz Joseph was sent to hell and the visible symbols of the Habsburg rule were relegated to the dustbin of history. The onset of the Yugoslav period in Slovene history ushered in the use of textbooks with a view to indoctrinating the future generations, that is, the part of the population that did not have personal experience of living under the Habsburg scepter. In both royal and socialist Yugoslavia, the authors of textbooks sought to eliminate the image of Franz Joseph from learning contents and frame his rule in the diction "the emperor was," "the court was," etc. His name was systematically removed from practically all textbooks in the said period. Strikingly, however, the emperor was the subject of "forgetting" rather than demonization: in addressing the periods when Franz Joseph's role could have been denigrated in line with both royal and socialist Yugoslav ideologies, textbooks simply sidelined rather than demonized him. The perception of Franz Joseph's historical role began to change in the early 1980s, during the gradual disintegration of Yugoslavia, when literature rekindled the interest in the period of the monarchy and Franz Joseph, who returned to Slovene historical consciousness with his full name and reclaimed his symbolic role of the good old emperor.

This study collates information about the resources, institutional structures, and financial sources that support the research of Nigerian languages from published scientific articles. Relevant publications were systematically retrieved from Google, Web of Science, and Scopus. Information on research data availability, authors' institutional affiliation, and funding acknowledgement was collected from the full texts of the NLP publications fur analysis. Results reveal that only 14.28% of the published papers shared 18 different resources (speech and textual corpora, electronic dictionary, and source codes) online, and 27.95% of the articles were funded. Support for the NLP of Nigerian languages was significantly higher from outside Nigeria-for instance, most of the funding sources were from the United States, France, and the United Kingdom. Secondly, more papers were written by authors that were affiliated with institutions outside Nigeria than authors from within Nigeria. Thirdly, most of the available resources on online repositories were shared by authors that were affiliated with institutions outside Nigeria. The top five research hubs on the NLP of Nigerian languages are Obafemi Awolowo University, Nigeria; the University of Sheffield, United Kingdom; the University of Uyo, Nigeria; African Languages Technology Initiative, Nigeria; and the University of Ibadan, Nigeria. Instances of research collaboration between Nigerian and foreign universities for NLP capacity building were identified. This study provides an insight into the existing structure and resources for the NLP of Nigerian languages, which could be harnessed by stakeholders for the development of Nigerian languages.

J	Babelyuk, O; Koliasa, O; Smaglii, V				Babelyuk, Oksana; Koliasa, Olena; Smaglii, Valeriia			LANGUAGE MEANS OF REVEALING POSTMODERN LUDIC ABSURD IN ENGLISH LITERARY TEXT	WISDOM			English	Article						ludic absurd; language means; linguo-philosophical; cognitive; poetic aspects; language levels		The fiction politics of contemporaneity reflects diversified patterns of language forms and their functions. This has brought to life experimental (postmodernist) writing the key principles of intertextuality, fragmentation, destruction, play. Postmodernist aesthetics caused a blurring of traditional genre canons that led to contamination of syncretic genre compounds through a grotesque transformation of traditional genre models and created an ,,estrangement' effect. The phenomenon of ludic absurd is viewed in three aspects: 1) linguo-philosophical; 2) cognitive; 3) poetic. The present study focuses on the analysis of ludic absurd; the role of graphic, phonetic, morphemic, word-forming, syntactical, semantic mechanisms, based on the intentional deviation of language norm, play on words; cognitive mechanisms, generated by ad-hoc way of thinking. The conducted linguopoetic analysis of American postmodern short stories suggests that ludic absurd as a stylistic device of postmodern poetics manifests itself at all language levels (lexical, syntactic, semasiological, and textual) and is realized via the semantic asymmetry of lexical units, using illogical, but grammatically correct syntactic constructions, syntactic mismatch of sentences and whole text fragments. Prospects for further studies consist in clarifying the pragmatic role of ludic absurd in the postmodern literary text; expanding the taxonomy of lexico-semantic, stylistic, and syntactic and paragraphemic means of ludic absurd.

J	Bozdogan, S; Benek, S				Bozdogan, Selim; Benek, Sedat			An Evaluation on Theoretical Foundations of Space and Place Concepts in Modern Geographical	JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHY-COGRAFYA DERGISI			English	Article						Absolute Space; Place; Space-Place Relationship	POLITICS	The purpose of this study is to examine how the concepts of space and place are theorized in the history of thought and their effects on geographical thought. Place and space are occasionally used interchangeably and sometimes have completely different definitions in today's dictionaries, both in ordinary and discipline dictionaries. There are different ways of defining the concepts of space and place in the discipline of geography. Therefore, in order to understand the different definitions of space and place in geography, it is essential to analyze the epistemological traditions that feed on the ways of using both concepts. As it is a conceptual, historical, and theoretical study, "textual analysis" technique, which is a qualitative method, has been used. In conclusion, this research looks at how two different perspectives on space and place affect geographical thinking. The first is modern thought's evolving notion of "absolute space." The second concern is phenomenologists' challenges of the concept of absolute space. Space and location are treated independently in different philosophical systems. The critique of the phenomenological dimension of both absolute space and place approaches is put forward, in general terms, based on the concept of social space. In this context, David Harvey and Doreen Massey highlight the relational dimension of space and place based on the idea of social space. In this relation, space as a social product expresses the sum of places. It is a phenomenon that has been ignored for a long time that places make sense of space as a "difference/total."

J	Hernandez, EC				Calero Hernandez, Estela			The Spanish teaching methods published in Massachusetts, United States, in the 19th Century	REVISTA ARGENTINA DE HISTORIOGRAFIA LINGUISTICA			Spanish	Article						Spanish teaching; 19th Century; American historiography; Spanish dictionaries		The 19th Century entailed the rise of language teaching in the United States of America. After the nation had born barely a century ago, many linguists, politicians, merchants and teachers saw a niche market of Spanish teaching to those Americans of Anglo-Saxon or Germanic heritage, originating from Europe, and to their descendants. Spanish was especially relevant in the country due to their presence in North America since the 16th Century, and to its category of dominant or official language in most of the countries of Central and South America. Therefore, the most important places of universities and publishing houses, such as Boston and Cambridge in Massachusetts, witnessed the fervent publishing activity of authors who distributed many texts to the teaching of the Spanish language: bilingual vocabularies, grammars, dictionaries and manuals. The Biblioteca Virtual de la Filologia Espariola, which constitutes the basis of this work, not only has allowed us to reunite the publications of Spanish language teaching in Massachusetts, but also has permitted us to reconstruct many of the lives of its authors, which sometimes had been unnoticed to the history.

Attention is focused on the distinguishing features of Lenin's texts on a lexical, syntactical, rhetorical, and functional and pragmatic levels, which his contemporaries perceived and described as deviations against the background of the standard political and linguistic forms of the era. The imperative character, purposefulness, pragmatism, and neat endless elasticity of the linguistic structures are traced in the example of a palette from the fifteen different meanings of Lenin's idiom of partiinost', which arose in numerous contexts of the political and intellectual polemics led by the founder of the USSR.

J	Chiang, TH				Chiang, Tien-Hui			What Freirean Critical Pedagogy Says and Overlooks from a Durkheimian Perspective	SOCIAL INCLUSION			English	Article						academic curriculum; educational inequity; emancipatory function; Freirean critical pedagogy; power relations; social mobility	EDUCATION	"Critical pedagogy" has become a prevalent grammar furthering the necessity of a change in pedagogy from a bankingstyle to problem-posing approach, which it argues will facilitate students' development of independent values and equip them to lead the liberation of society from authoritarianism into democracy. To achieve this, classrooms need to serve as cultural forums, through which either engaged pedagogy or negotiated authority empowers teachers and students to engage in free dialogues that problematize school textbooks as "cultural politics." This empowerment demands that teachers perform as transformative intellectuals, dedicating themselves to the amelioration of inequity in educational results by reconstructing new texts, making them more accessible to working-class students. While these theoretical lexicons envision a new perspective for the "educational function," alleviation of the phenomenon of cultural reproduction can only occur if critical pedagogists pay more attention to academic curricula. Student achievements in such curricula, which respond to the demands of the social division of labor, have a profound influence on their potential social mobility.

Connections of this type can sometimes also be found in scientific publications, e.g. in articles in Polish describing the Russian language (lexical or grammatical issues, etc.) or Russian cultural and political realities. The study analyses this phenomenon on the basis of selected examples. In sentences quoting foreign language material in this way, the boundary between two languages (e.g. Ukrainian and Polish, Belarusian and Russian, etc.) and their respective syntactic systems is blurred.

What previously seemed an almost impossible undertaking has given way to a significant production, thanks to multiple renewals and to openness towards sources considered unusual for historians. However, if this enterprise is more or less simple for contemporary history and the history of the present, it is far from being obvious as far as the medieval period, in which this article focuses, is concerned (from the end of the Xth century to the end of the XIVth century AD). Texts of jurisconsults, hagiographic sources, biographical dictionaries as well as the accounts of travellers and chroniclers allow us to gather information on the position of women in medieval Morocco. These sources made women's contribution in a certain number of fields visible: in the political and cultural fields but also through the professions they were allowed to exercise. More specifically, this article focuses on the contribution of women to different domains like notably the political and cultural as well as on the different professions women were allowed to exercise in order to take account of the various female activities that have long remained ignored. This article sheds light on the characteristics of these women who "escaped" omission by their strength of character, their proximity to sites of power, their knowledge, or by their so-called "productive" contribution, whom traces are not easy to detect.

J	Hankinson, J				Hankinson, Joseph			the terror of sheer bigness" Microplotting Immensity in Frank Norris's The Octopus	STYLE			English	Article						Frank Norris; globalisation; style; technology; cognitive mapping		This article traces the stylistic consequences of the attempt to map seemingly infinitely expanding networks of trade and value in Frank Norris's The Octopus (1901). It focuses on the rehearsal at the level of the sentence of characters' grappling with the "terror of sheer bigness," and the complex interrelation of public and private, political and personal, local and global inaugurated by the railroad's management of the distribution of wheat. The textures of Norris's style-his grammar, syntax, and diction-are implicated in the novel's interrogation and negotiation of these dislocations. From the failures of mimetic phrasing spiralling across lengthy cumulative sentences to patterns of phrasal repetition, the various microplots at work within the novel's verbal landscapes represent an essential and often overlooked facet of the force of The Octopus.

J	Kovbasko, Y; Ikalyuk, L				Kovbasko, Yurii; Ikalyuk, Lesya			Socio-Psycholinguistic Features of 'till'/`until' Functioning in Present-Day English (Corpus-Based and Corpus-Driven Research)	PSYCHOLINGUISTICS			English	Article						socio-psycholinguistic factors; discourse type; text domain; age; gender; social class		The aim of the research. The paper is to clarify the role of socio-psycholinguistic factors of lexical units 'till'/'until' functioning in present-day English. The research is focused on the lexical units 'till'/'until', which are the objects of functional transposition, as a result of which both units are determined and function as prepositions and conjunctions, are defined by the identical vocabulary definitions, derive from the same part of speech - preposition and undergo functional transposition into the category of conjunction. Nevertheless, they are characterized by a diverse level of institutionalization in the language, what is proved by the statistical data. Therefore we put forward the hypothesis that the divergences in applying the units depend on the socio-psycholinguistic factors, which characterize the speech at the present stage of the language development and determine the institutionalization level of any transpositional process. Methods. The analysis is represented by the corpus-based and corpus-driven research and is grounded on the data, retrieved from the British National Corpus (BNC) as the most balanced and representative source of written and oral extracts of the English language. Under the research, socio-psycholinguistic factors are divided into linguistic, viz. discourse type, text type, derived text type, text domain, context-governed text domain and type of interaction, the level of difficulty, and socio-psychological factors, viz. age and gender of an author (for written discourse), age, gender, and social class of a speaker and respondent (for spoken discourse). Results and conclusion. The obtained data testify that there are almost no difference between the preposition and conjunction `till', except for the authors' and speakers' age. The figures of the categories prove the further expansion of the preposition `till'. The preposition and conjunction `until' are characterized by more profound divergences, in particular, on the side of linguistic factors. Taking into account the fact that sociopsychological factors determine the linguistic peculiarities of the language units in discourse, it is worth stating that the preposition `until' is characterized by the lowest number of points of intersection with other units under study, which predetermines its potential for further analysis from the perspective of modern psycholinguistics.

METAPHORIC INTERPRETATION OF COMMUNICATIVE VALUES IN TODAY'S FLASH FICTION	IZVESTIYA URALSKOGO FEDERALNOGO UNIVERSITETA-SERIYA 2-GUMANITARNYE NAUKI			Russian	Article						communicative values; linguo-axiological construction; linguaculture; mass culture; metaphor; word-centrism; fiction text		Referring to literary texts, this article considers the possibilities of systematisation and interpretation of the values of Russian culture. For specialised analysis, the author chooses flash fiction by Denis Dragunsky, Mikhail Shishkin, and novel prose by Pavel Krusanov, Alexey Slapovsky, Alexey Salnikov, and Maria Stepanova. The purpose of the research, which is carried out within the field of axiological stylistics, is to identify relevant communicative values with the help of the latest Russian prose. A brief outline of the politicisation and depoliticisation of the Russian language and basic values of culture provides a general idea about the basic values on the time scale of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. The coordination of stylistic and linguacultural methods of analysis identified a strategy of word-centrism, which is common for the authors chosen and finds its expression in the formation of an open supra-textual lexical paradigm. Each component of the paradigmatic row nominates a communicative value and at the same time acts as an object of the author's metaphorical interpretation. The verdict on the "dead" language of the totalitarian era and the "stillborn" language of modern mass literature, full of viruses of vulgarity, profit, and consumerism, is accompanied by the construction of a detailed metaphor of the road, which makes it possible to put forward a socially significant task of linguoaxiological construction. Based on metaphorical diagnostics of speech existence, there are distinguished numerous axiological constants, i.e. a living language and a living word. Not "the only true" word, but a word charged with emotional energy should become an instrument of linguo-axiological construction, which is to be carried out on the basis of creative use of language as a system of possibilities. The ethnotype of a real Russian writer is formed. which is contrasted with the linguacultural type of a successful word seller. The Russian writer, who selflessly serves the Russian language, is to pave the way to a living language by creating texts, which would continue the traditions of classical Russian literature as an imperishable national value.

J	Lelicanin, MK; Sosic, BR				Lelicanin, Marija Koprivica; Sosic, Bojana Radenkovic			Metamodernism and Language: Pandemic Era Advertising	ETNOANTROPOLOSKI PROBLEMI-ISSUES IN ETHNOLOGY AND ANTHROPOLOGY			Ukrainian	Article						metamodernism; Italian language; advertising; semiotics; pandemic	POSTMODERN	In cultural theory, metamodernism becomes a new cultural paradigm of the twenty-first century, epistemologically with (post) modernism, ontologically between (post) modernism, and historically beyond (post) modernism. It appears in the context of political changes following the fall of the Berlin Wall and the environment of digital progress, but also in periods of financial and ecological crises. Rather than simple "zeitgeist", metamodernism as an arriving cultural paradigm is to be understood more as a "structure of feelings" or sentiment so pervasive that it becomes structural. Metamodernism is symbolically presented by the dual nature of God's messenger Eros, who operates between the worlds of mortals and immortals. Another metaphor to illustrate metamodernism is a pendulum that constantly fluctuates between opposites such as modern hope and postmodern melancholy, empathy and apathy or enthusiasm and irony. This paper examines Italian advertisements during the largest contemporary health crisis, the SARS-CoV-2 virus outbreak. The semiotic textual analysis is performed on the audio-visual commercials of well known companies, such as Vodafone and Barilla. In addition to this, several print advertisements of a local company for funeral services Taffo are considered. Different metamodern characteristics are recognised in all examined texts. In already confirmed pandemic narratives (such as "the celebration of being Italian and patriotic solidarity", "the juxtapositioning of the "inside" and the "outside", and the "humanization of technology at the service of human affections and emotions"), now the metamodem characteristics, as a new structure of feeling that brings hope, continuous oscillations between contrasted polls and a certain quirkiness, are being identified. The most relevant morphosyntactic, lexical and semantic traits of the Italian language in pandemic advertising are being compared with the same language tools in postmodern Italian advertising. Finally, different stylistic and pragmatic, rhetorical and semiotic tools are being interpreted and analysed, defining more closely the unique characteristics of "metamodern" pandemic advertising.

Twitter sentiment analysis aims at automatic identification and extraction of such opinionated data, gaining the attention of many researchers. Twitter gives a good opportunity to explore mass data, and it opens challenges of processing big data, and automatic identification and extraction of subjective information from short texts. Many methods and resources have been proposed in literature for automatic identification of subjective information from natural language texts. In this paper, we have proposed a fast mode of polarity detection using multi-lexicon features. The binary-valued multi-lexicon features save time and space for handling them for large data. Furthermore, we have used the modified-SMO with Apache Spark to process large datasets effectively. The experiments show that the method supports high scalability, and it improves the efficiency of the polarity detection.	[Lijo, V.

J	Liu, SJ; Teng, J; Gong, Y				Liu, Shaojie; Teng, Jing; Gong, Yue			Extraction Method and Integration Framework for Perception Features of Public Opinion in Transportation	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						smart traffic management; transportation public opinion; emotional analysis; features extraction; integrated application; social media analytics	SOCIAL MEDIA; POLICY	To better facilitate government management and planning based on public opinion, it is essential to propose a method for extracting public opinion perception features in consideration of an integrated framework, which aims at industry monitoring and decision-making. Based on fundamental characteristics of ordinary traffic incidents, this paper develops a perception features system of public opinion consisting of four modules, where the construction methods have been elaborated. First, mining thematic features is realized via the similarity calculation of text vector. Second, based on summarized Chinese expression patterns, time extraction rules, and a five-layer tree-like spatial feature thesaurus are established to extract spatiotemporal features. Third, the modeling of the emotional features is achieved by a dictionary-based analysis model. Fourth, the evolutional features are extracted by the Exponential Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity (EGARCH). In view of the attributes of each module, an integrated framework is built to determine the collaboration relationship of feature indicators. Finally, a case study of Shenzhen public transport has been performed to illustrate the application of proposed methods. Results show that the strong odor in electric buses and a rumor that electric buses have great radiation are two main causes of the decrease in passenger satisfaction in the first quarter of 2017. In contrast, adding new bus lines, increasing service frequency, and guaranteeing the bus-lane right will improve passenger satisfaction, which is basically consistent with the official report. It should be noticed that the developed framework has been validated in the case study of passenger satisfaction analysis, while it can be extensively replicated in other fields. Furthermore, it is important for stakeholders to grasp the public perception of transportation services, in order to enhance public participation in transportation management and decision-making.

COVID-19 PANDEMIC IN POLITICAL CARTOONS OF THE AMERICAN PRESS: AN EXPERIENCE OF MULTIMODAL ANALYSIS	NAUCHNYI DIALOG			Russian	Article						cartoons; coronavirus; media discourse; multimodal text; pandemic; Covid-19		An attempt is made to analyze the place of political cartoons in the current socio-political media discourse in the United States. The material was the cartoons published in the spring of 2020 from USA Today and Philadelphia Inquirer, the informational occasion for the creation of which was the Covid-19 pandemic. The definitions of political cartoons as a multimodal text with a complex coding system is considered in the article. It is noted that in this type of text, phenomenological cognitive structures are actualized both through linguistic projection and through visual-spatial images. Attention is paid to intertextuality as the basis of political cartoon: the authors proceed from the position that the decoding of meaning by the recipient depends on whether he and the author have common background knowledge. It is shown that the Covid-19 pandemic is thematically embedded in the broader socio-political agenda, whereby a successful interpretation requires the recipient to have background knowledge of the current sociopolitical challenges facing the United States, namely the domestic political agenda. It is stated that the studied cartoons are distinguished by their reliance on precedent, and the actualization of background knowledge occurs through a combination of the visual and verbal components of the text. It is concluded that among the linguistic means of creating a satirical effect, a play on words is distinguished based on the literal and figurative meaning of individual lexical units.

Automated dictionary generation for political eventcoding	POLITICAL SCIENCE RESEARCH AND METHODS			English	Article						Mathematical modeling; measurement; text and content analysis	CONFLICT	Event data provide high-resolution and high-volume information about political events and have supported a variety of research efforts across fields within and beyond political science. While these datasets are machine coded from vast amounts of raw text input, the necessary dictionaries require substantial prior knowledge and human effort to produce and update, effectively limiting the application of automated event-coding solutions to those domains for which dictionaries already exist. I introduce a novel method for generating dictionaries appropriate for event coding given only a small sample dictionary. This technique leverages recent advances in natural language processing and machine learning to reduce the prior knowledge and researcher-hours required to go from defining a new domain-of-interest to producing structured event data that describe that domain. I evaluate the method with the production of a novel event dataset on cybersecurity incidents.

J	Rudnev, DV; Pushkareva, NV				Rudnev, Dmitriy, V; Pushkareva, Natalia, V			REGULATIONS OF PETER THE GREAT IN THE ASPECT OF IMPERATIVENESS	VESTNIK VOLGOGRADSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA-SERIYA 2-YAZYKOZNANIE			Russian	Article						business language; history of business Russian; 18th century; Petrine epoch; regulations; imperativeness; modal modifier; intensifier		In the era of Peter the Great, a new genre of regulations appeared in the Russian official language, with the help of which the authorities tried to introduce new, European principles of governing the country in Russia. The authors of the regulations were faced with the difficult task of finding speech means adequate to the new genre, corresponding both to the communicative tasks and to the addressee of the regulations. The performed analysis demonstrates a significant update of the means of the official language used in the Peter's regulations. In particular, the ways of expressing imperative have undergone a significant transformation. Along with the independent infinitive, which was inherited from pre-Petrine official speech, imperativeness begins to be expressed by various lexical means - both Russian and borrowed in origin (Polonisms, Germanisms, Latinisms): modifiers dolzhen 'must' , imet "have to', nadlezhit 'should' , prinuzhden 'be forced', etc. in combination with the infinitive, a particle da 'let' in combination with a verb in the present or future tense, etc. The models differed not only in origin and stylistic coloring, but also in their compatibility. Changes in the system of imperative means were due to various reasons - semantic (the need to more accurately express the imperative meaning), stylistic (the desire to make a business text more bookish, to tear it away from the colloquial basis), socio-cultural (the influence of European text patterns and socio-cultural models).

Further, a topic modeling approach was employed to gain insights about the most discussed topic by the US community during pandemic. A total number of 1,385,469 tweets were collected for the purpose of the study over the period of early February to late April. In addition, unsupervised approaches were employed in the analysis including VADER lexicon for sentiment analysis and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for topic modelling. The main findings of the research showed that the largest share of the collected tweets is of positive sentiment followed by negative and neutral. Further, temporal sentiment analysis on monthly basis in comparison with COVID-19 cases showed how the tweets polarity changed over time from early February to late April. In total, the polarity of the tweets was negative before the virus outbreak and positive during the outbreak. In addition, LDA analysis showed that the overall discussed topics tend are oriented toward economy, politics, and the spread of the virus outside the US in February while March and April topics are oriented toward discussing the prevention from the virus as well as spread of the virus inside USA.

Online Hate Speech in the 2016 US Election Campaign and its Aftermath	QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE			English	Article						Hate speech; social media; Donald Trump; Twitter; text-as-data	DISCURSIVE OPPORTUNITIES; SILENCE	To what extent did online hate speech and white nationalist rhetoric on Twitter increase over the course of Donald Trump's 2016 presidential election campaign and its immediate aftermath? The prevailing narrative suggests that Trump's political rise - and his unexpected victory - lent legitimacy to and popularized bigoted rhetoric that was once relegated to the dark corners of the Internet. However, our analysis of over 750 million tweets related to the election, in addition to almost 400 million tweets from a random sample of American Twitter users, provides systematic evidence that hate speech did not increase on Twitter over this period. Using both machine-learning-augmented dictionary-based methods and a novel classification approach leveraging data from Reddit communities associated with the alt-right movement, we observe no persistent increase in hate speech or white nationalist language either over the course of the campaign or in the six months following Trump's election. While key campaign events and policy announcements produced brief spikes in hateful language, these bursts quickly dissipated. Overall we find no empirical support for the proposition that Trump's divisive campaign or election increased hate speech on Twitter.

J	Sokolova, O				Sokolova, Olga			THE IMPERATIVE DAESH' AS A MARKER OF INTENSIFICATION OF ILLOCUTIONARY FORCE IN SOVIET POLITICAL DISCOURSE	ZBORNIK MATICE SRPSKE ZA SLAVISTIKU-MATICA SRPSKA JOURNAL OF SLAVIC STUDIES			Serbian	Article						Soviet political discourse; imperatives; grammaticalization; illocutionary forces; language and discourse creativity; avant-garde poetry; political agitation		The article deals with semantic changes and discourse transfers of the imperative daesh' in a case study of the late 1910s - early 1930s text corpus. In the process of the grammaticalization (also known as "grammaticization"), lexical word (the imperative day(te) 'give') is transformed into a grammar word, or function word, changing its distribution and function in the process (the imperatives day/davay 'let us' and daesh'). This imperative daesh' is the subject matter of our analysis because it overcame descriptive functions and increased the intensity of illocutionary force in the further process of grammaticalization. Numerous slogans of the late 1910s - early 1930s formed with the imperative daesh' highlighted the significant role of this unit in the creating of the Soviet language. The transfer of this unit from the "sailor", proletarian language to the sphere of wide common usage determines the "slogan-forming" role of the imperative. The avant-garde authors, which included the unit in their agitation and poetic texts, played an important role in this discourse transfer. The avant-garde artistic discourse allowed revealing linguistic and creative potential of the imperative daesh' and developed it as the key imperative of the Soviet political discourse. The analysis made it possible to identify the mechanisms of linguistic and discursive creativity that formed the basis for the creation of the "language of revolution" in the 1920s, as well as to trace the subsequent reverse tendency of the Soviet political discourse towards stereotyping and seriality.

Considering the name-calling and obscene and abusive phrases as communication practice, we rely on computational linguistics to investigate incivility in comments posted on online news stories and news portals' social media sites across time, platforms, and topics. The results of the dictionary-based quantitative content analysis show that incivility's frequency is steady in the examined three-year period. The topic and platform make the real difference: Politics attract more uncivil comments than business news, and less incivility is detected on Facebook than on the news sites. Contrary to popular perceptions, we find that incivility has not become significantly intensive in election campaign periods. Incivility, however, correlates to the dynamics of interaction. The comment-level analysis suggests that uncivil messages are likely to be surrounded by the same communication feature.

J	Velicu, AM				Velicu, Anca-Marina			The Anglicization of Romance Languages in the Discourse of What is still Called "National" Education: the Case for French and Romanian	PHILOLOGICA JASSYENSIA			Italian	Article						linguistic borrowings; anglicization; Neo-Latin languages; academic marketing; academic governance; national education		The Anglicization of French and Romanian academic marketing discourse (official discourse of stakeholders in national education systems herby included) is a natural consequence of the global domination of English as vehicular language in science and technology, as well as in economics and in media: primary neology, especially in emergent domains (such as Internet, social networking, digital marketing etc.) takes place in English. English has become the global language of scientific research and several university programs are directly taught in English (in Romance language speaking countries) - hence a certain loss of domains for the latter. French and Romanian cultures are not equally equipped for defending their respective linguistic territories, with French institutions far more structured and efficient, even if language planning is quite present in our country also. Romanian linguists are not of one mind about Anglicization. And the loss of domains doesn't seem to bother too much either the Romanian Academy nor the stakeholders in Romanian Education. This paper will only tackle the topics of specific patterns in French and Romanian academic marketing discourse and in the discourse of institutional decision makers in the university education system. After a short overview aiming at the contrastive approach to the notions of Anglicism and Anglicization (beyond the problem of national education's linguistic governance, one should distinguish between Anglicization as anthropological process and Anglicisms as linguistic borrowings from English - loan words, semantic borrowings or syntactic borrowings), we will provide some results of an illustrative corpus research (a manually compiled comparable corpus of 50 French and 50 Romanian text samples in academic marketing, including samples of written discourse by university and national education decision makers). Pertaining to lexical/ (terminological) borrowings, we shall insist on their pervasive effects on native polysemy and synonymy, based on the analysis of the French family of synonyms management/administration/gestion (and their Romanian counterparts).

Senti-COVID19: An Interactive Visual Analytics System for Detecting Public Sentiment and Insights Regarding COVID-19 From Social Media	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						COVID-19; Social networking (online); Sentiment analysis; Data visualization; Visual analytics; Market research; Regulation; Coronavirus; COVID-19; information visualization; sentiment analysis; visual analytic	KEYWORD EXTRACTION	As governments take measures against COVID-19, the epidemic situation is expected to improve, but public sentiment is likely to fluctuate during this process, potentially influencing the best course of action. Social media has become a prevalent way for the public to express emotions and opinions in recent times. So that, the sentiment analysis on top of it may detect and provide valuable evidence of public attitude and help governments subsequent formulation of measures and policies. We present Senti-COVID19, an interactive visual analytic system for reflecting and analyzing public sentiment and detecting sentiment fluctuation triggers on social media. Senti-COVID19 adopts lexicon-based sentiment analysis to divulge the public opinion to COVID-19 events, employing libraries to extract keywords and statistics for providing detailed information. In addition, it offers visualizations for presenting the analysis, allowing users to quickly discover relevant information. Our results show that Senti-COVID19 can be used effectively to analyze sentiment from social media text, allowing users to explore derived data and identify insights from the collected tweets.

J	Dahlberg, S; Axelsson, S; Holmberg, S				Dahlberg, Stefan; Axelsson, Sofia; Holmberg, Soren			Democracy in context: using a distributional semantic model to study differences in the usage of democracy across languages and countries	ZEITSCHRIFT FUR VERGLEICHENDE POLITIKWISSENSCHAFT			English	Article						Cross-cultural surveys; Distributional semantics; Meaning of democracy; Online text data; Translation discrepancies; Word embeddings	SATISFACTION; SUPPORT	Cross-cultural survey research rests upon the assumption that if survey features are kept constant, data will remain comparable across languages, cultures and countries. Yet translating concepts across languages, cultures and political contexts is complicated by linguistic, cultural, normative or institutional discrepancies. Such discrepancies are particularly relevant for complex political concepts such as democracy, where the literature on political support has revealed significant cross-cultural differences in people's attitudes toward democracy. Recognizing that language, culture and other socio-political variables affect survey results has often been equated with giving up on comparative research and many survey researchers have consequently chosen to simply ignore the issue of comparability and measurement equivalence across languages, cultures and countries. This paper contributes to the debate, using a distributional semantic lexicon, which is a statistical model measuring co-occurrence statistics in large text data. The method is motivated by structuralist meaning theory, stating that words with similar meanings tend to occur in similar contexts, and that contexts shape and define the meanings of words. Compared to other methodological approaches aimed at identifying and measuring cross-cultural discrepancies, this approach enables us to systematically analyze how the concept of democracy is used in its natural habitat. Collecting geo-tagged language data from news and social online source documents this paper descriptively explores varieties in meanings of democracy across a substantial number of languages and countries, and maps ways in which democracy is used among online populations and regions worldwide.

Using Loughran and McDonald's (2011) dictionary, we create four categories of word lists that define the positive/negative tone and degree of certainty/uncertainty of news. We document three relevant findings. First, negative news significantly affects bank stock returns. Second, media coverage and the degree of certainty of the news are associated with more severe stock market losses. Third, bank capital and risk-adjusted performance mitigate the effect of negative news on stock prices. Overall, our study suggests that media talk on bank corporate governance events is an important determinant of abnormal stock returns. (c) 2020 Published by Elsevier B.V.

An Exploratory Study on the Readability of Frequently-used Nutrition Terms	JOURNAL OF LIBRARY AND INFORMATION STUDIES			English	Article						Readability; Content Analysis; Online Nutrition Information; Women of First Pregnancy	INFORMATION-SEEKING; CHILD HEALTH; EDUCATION; LITERACY; IMPACT; WEB	People easily access nutrition information just by typing the keywords into the search engine. However, past studies have shown that popular health information websites that are addressed to everyday users tend to be easy to use, while the information quality is questionable. Researchers attempt to increase the readability of nutrition education materials. This study analyzed the nutrition terminology used in government nutrition websites by n-gram cutter and nutrition dictionary. The results of the generated nutrition terminology list were presented to 58 women of first pregnancy, who has the highest demand of nutrition information. This study was designed in two stages. The first stage was content analysis of online nutrition information, which attempted to identify the nutrition terms that have been used. The second stage was the glossary comprehension test on the 58 research participants toward 104 nutrition terms used in the texts. The purpose of this study is to understand the comprehension of first pregnancy women towards nutrition terms and categorize terms by the result. Outcome of the comprehension test shown that self-cognition was highly related to real-cognition, but there are still some exceptions. According to the relations between self-reported-cognition and actual-cognition, terms can be categorized as "familiarized words," "incomprehensible words," "overrated vocabulary" and "low confidence word." In the future professionals are advised to use these terms accordingly based on the different level of comprehension. This study constructs a method of analyzing terms and identifying a list of nutrition terminologies that is accurate and appropriate, which can be applied to different field of professions.

Based on the concepts of capabilities, student experience and life events, the study, conducted by questionnaire, mainly sought to better understand the guidance path lived, of 110 students enrolled in the second year of a degree in psychology in France (objective 1). Mobilizing, in order to compare (objective 2), two methods of textual analysis carried out in double blind, one automatic, other manual, the results show that the enunciation of the events having marked their trajectory and their current questioning in orientation testify of a reflexive activity in link with their capabilities. By mentioning rich past experiences, painful episodes of life, various influences and frequent readjustments, the events mentioned show a certain distance to oneself and a propensity to think about the future in relation to the past. Marked by speeches of uncertainty and fear concerning the capability and identity aspects, the academic choices to be made and the future vocational integration to be carried out, the student questions are mainly part of a short temporality. Capacitive devices in vocational guidance are discussed and extensions of analysis and research outlined. (C) 2020 Published by Elsevier Masson SAS on behalf of Societe Francaise de Psychologie.

Distilling the abundant textual information is helpful for a better understanding of the character during this public event. Methods: We collected the texts of 2211 news reports from 83 mainstream media outlets in China between 15 July and 25 August 2018, and used a structural topic model (STM) to identify the major topics and features that emerged. We also used dictionary-based sentiment analysis to uncover the sentiments expressed by the topics as well as their temporal variations. Results: The main topics of the news report fell into six major categories, including: (1) Media Investigation, (2) Response from the Top Authority, (3) Government Action, (4) Knowledge Dissemination, (5) Finance Related and (6) Commentary. The topic prevalence shifted during different stages of the events, illustrating the actions by the government. Sentiments generally spanned from negative to positive, but varied according to different topics. Conclusion: The characteristics of news reports on vaccines are shaped by various topics at different stages. The inner dynamics of the topic and its alterations are driven by the interaction between social sentiment and governmental intervention.

The Representation of the Concept "Road" in Oral Stories of Siberians	TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL			Russian	Article						road; concept; Siberia; cross-border region; oral speech of Siberians; linguistic worldview		The article describes the concept "road" as represented in oral stories of Siberians. This investigation is part of a comprehensive, interdisciplinary study of Siberia as a cross-border area. The research materials are: texts of the Tomsk Dialect Corpus, which were recorded during dialectological expeditions from the 1940s to 2019 in the areas where old-timer Middle Ob region dialects are spoken; information from dialect dictionaries, memoirs and oral stories of eyewitnesses and witnesses of dekulakization and exile to the Narym region; materials of the project "Free and Non-Free Siberians" published on the website of the Tomsk Regional Museum of Local Lore. A concept is a unit of consciousness that is represented by means of a language. The article uses a modeling method that is implemented through the description of the nominative field of the concept "road", which includes both direct nominations of the concept itself and nominations of its individual cognitive features. Among the units that represent the concept "road", there are: the word road and its synonym way, their derivatives, as well as words that name roads in accordance with their various characteristics, words of different parts of speech and phrases that contain the seme "road": traffic, taxi, taxi driver, turnpike, country road, to go, to swim, to get lost, and many others. The contextual analysis of the material revealed that the following cognitive features receive language objectification: 1) the size of the road and its importance, 2) the use of roads depending on the time of year, 3) place of laying the road, 4) the kind of transport and method of travel, 5) the material from which the road is made, 5) the quality of the road 6) the direction of the road, 7) the road as an integral part of migration processes, 8) construction, laying and maintenance of roads, 9) the road as a factor in the formation of different social ties, communities and an additional reason for economic activity (crafts, entrepreneurship, etc.), 10) the road as an indicator of the development of Siberia, civilization and improvement, 11) the road as a dangerous place, 12) the road as a way of localization, 13) the road as an attribute of superstitions, rituals. Siberians' autobiographical stories and memoirs contain fragments that reflect the importance and significance of the road in human life. Facts from people's life connected with the road are: birth on the road, road to school/university/institute, wedding, work, moving, death. The road is a significant fragment of the Siberians' worldview; it reflects the spatial and temporal characteristics of people's lives, representing the "friend/foe" opposition. Formal (changes in road categories, obsolescence of expressions, new stable combinations and lexemes) and substantive (new roads, reinterpretation, de-ideologization of road spaces associated with the repressive policy of the state, etc.) transformations in the structure of the concept are due to time (change of epochs) and to political and economic factors.

The Production of a Water Conservation Discourse Through Twitter: The Water use it Wisely Campaign in Arizona	ENVIRONMENTAL COMMUNICATION-A JOURNAL OF NATURE AND CULTURE			English	Article						Water conservation; public campaign; Twitter; lexicometry; Arizona	CLIMATE-CHANGE; SOCIAL MEDIA; SUSTAINABILITY; POLITICS; DROUGHT; COMMUNICATION; URBANIZATION; CONSUMPTION; MANAGEMENT; FUKUSHIMA	In the context of global environmental changes, water scarcity has become a challenge, especially for rapidly urbanizing regions. Water conservation-demand management-has therefore become an important tool for managing water resources. Since communication is at the core of water conservation strategies, we use Twitter data to trace the construction process of a widespread discourse at the global scale. We conduct a quantitative textual analysis of the Water-Use It Wisely Twitter timeline dedicated to promoting water conservation in Arizona. Based on the text of 3500 tweets and profile descriptions of 15,204 related Twitter accounts, our results show that Twitter is used to convey a standardized water conservation message that finds an audience worldwide, even though some countries block the use of Twitter or use other technical tools. This communication aspect on social media, where a network of water professionals and a community of water activists can interact, works as a cornerstone in the construction of an institutional consensus around this new paradigm of water management.

Automatic extraction of urban outdoor perception from geolocated free texts	SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS AND MINING			English	Review						Perception extraction; Social media; Text mining; Urban outdoor areas; Dictionary creation		The automatic extraction of urban perception shared by people on location-based social networks (LBSNs) is an important multidisciplinary research goal. One of the reasons is it facilitates the understanding of the intrinsic characteristics of urban areas in a scalable way, helping to leverage new services. However, content shared on LBSNs is diverse, encompassing several topics, such as politics, sports, culture, religion, and urban perceptions, making the task of content extraction regarding a particular topic very challenging. Considering free-text messages shared on LBSNs, we propose an automatic and generic approach to extract people's perceptions. For that, our approach explores opinions that are spatiotemporal and semantically similar. We exemplify our approach in the context of urban outdoor areas in Chicago, New York City and London. Studying those areas, we found evidence that LBSN data bring valuable information about urban regions. To analyze and validate our outcomes, we conducted a temporal analysis to measure the results' robustness over time. We show that our approach can be helpful to better understand urban areas considering different perspectives. We also conducted a comparative analysis based on a public dataset, which contains volunteers' perceptions regarding urban areas expressed in a controlled experiment. We observe that both results yield a very similar level of agreement.

J	Chakraborty, B; Bhattacharjee, T				Chakraborty, Bijitaswa; Bhattacharjee, Titas			A review on textual analysis of corporate disclosure according to the evolution of different automated methods	JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND ACCOUNTING			English	Review						Textual analysis; Corporate disclosure; Automated method; Disclosure tone; Market performance	FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS; INFORMATION-CONTENT; VOLUNTARY; SENTIMENT; GOVERNANCE; RISK; DETERMINANTS; VOLATILITY; RETURNS; FINANCE	Purpose The purpose of this paper is to give a comprehensive review and synthesis of automated textual analysis of corporate disclosure to show how the accuracy of disclosure tone has been incremented with the evolution of developed automated methods that have been used to calculate tone in prior studies. Design/methodology/approach This study have conducted the survey on "automated textual analysis of corporate disclosure and its impact" by searching at Google Scholar and Scopus research database after the year 2000 to prepare the list of papers. After classifying the prior literature into a dictionary-based and machine learning-based approach, this study have again sub-classified those papers according to two other dimensions, namely, information sources of disclosure and the impact of tone on the market. Findings This study found literature on how value relevance of tone is varied with the use of different automated methods and using different information sources. This study also found literature on the impact of such tone on market. These are contributing to help investor's decision-making and earnings and returns prediction by researchers. The literature survey shows that the research gap lies in the development of methodologies toward the calculation of tone more accurately. This study also mention how different information sources and methodologies can influence the change in disclosure tone for the same firm, which, in turn, may change market performance. The research gap also lies in finding the determinants of disclosure tone with large scale data. Originality/value After reviewing some papers based on automated textual analysis of corporate disclosure, this study shows how the accuracy of the result is incrementing according to the evolution of automated methodology. Apart from the methodological research gaps, this study also identify some other research gaps related to determinants (corporate governance, firm-level, macroeconomic factors, etc.) and transparency or credibility of disclosure which could stimulate new research agendas in the areas of automated textual analysis of corporate disclosure.

Although the extraction of structured data from texts, known as natural language processing (NLP), has been researched at least for the English language extensively, it is not enough to get a structured output in any format. NLP techniques need to be used together with clinical information standards such as openEHR to be able to reuse and exchange still unstructured data sensibly. Objectives The aim of the study is to automatically extract crucial information from medical free texts and to transform this unstructured clinical data into a standardized and structured representation by designing and implementing an exemplary pipeline for the processing of pediatric medical histories. Methods We constructed a pipeline that allows reusing medical free texts such as pediatric medical histories in a structured and standardized way by (1) selecting and modeling appropriate openEHR archetypes as standard clinical information models, (2) defining a German dictionary with crucial text markers serving as expert knowledge base for a NLP pipeline, and (3) creating mapping rules between the NLP output and the archetypes. The approach was evaluated in a first pilot study by using 50 manually annotated medical histories from the pediatric intensive care unit of the Hannover Medical School. Results We successfully reused 24 existing international archetypes to represent the most crucial elements of unstructured pediatric medical histories in a standardized form. The self-developed NLP pipeline was constructed by defining 3.055 text marker entries, 132 text events, 66 regular expressions, and a text corpus consisting of 776 entries for automatic correction of spelling mistakes. A total of 123 mapping rules were implemented to transform the extracted snippets to an openEHR-based representation to be able to store them together with other structured data in an existing openEHR-based data repository. In the first evaluation, the NLP pipeline yielded 97% precision and 94% recall. Conclusion The use of NLP and openEHR archetypes was demonstrated as a viable approach for extracting and representing important information from pediatric medical histories in a structured and semantically enriched format. We designed a promising approach with potential to be generalized, and implemented a prototype that is extensible and reusable for other use cases concerning German medical free texts. In a long term, this will harness unstructured clinical data for further research purposes such as the design of clinical decision support systems. Together with structured data already integrated in openEHR-based representations, we aim at developing an interoperable openEHR-based application that is capable of automatically assessing a patient's risk status based on the patient's medical history at time of admission.

We find that corporate failure-related narrative disclosures significantly predict firms' failure up to two years ahead of actual failure. Additionally, we find that a financially distressed firm would become more vulnerable when financial constraints befall, which in turn would precipitate corporate failure. Various robustness tests assure the credibility of the explanatory ability of corporate failure-related narrative disclosures to predict corporate failure. Collectively, our results show the feasibility of these narrative-related disclosures in improving the explanatory power of models that predict corporate failure.

ANALYSIS OF WAYS TO IMPROVE CONSTITUTIONAL REGULATION IN THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION	REVISTA INCLUSIONES			English	Article						Constitutional regulation; Norms; Normative legal acts; Legal technique; Regulation		The factor that has led to the analysis of various problems of constitutional regulation is the lack of systematic scientific knowledge about the existing theoretical and legal problems of the phenomenon in focus and the ways of its improvement. This has posed a task of specifying the existing technical, legal, logical, grammatical inconsistencies, gaps and defects of the Constitution of the Russian Federation and working out effective ways to overcome them. Among such problems is the presence in the text of the Russian Constitution of a large number of hidden terms that implying a different content, the non-observance of the logical sequence of the use of terms, the inaccurate use of verbal moods. The purpose of the present article is to analyze the ways to improve the constitutional regulation of the Russian Federation as a political and legal phenomenon. The leading method of research is the comparative legal method that makes it possible to identify the urgent theoretical and legal problems of constitutional regulation. The result of the study consists in the description of effective ways to overcome problems of constitutional regulation in the Russian Federation. In particular, it is proposed to organize on a continuing basis activities aimed at including in the legal dictionaries and doctrinal comments the terminology that reveals the content of constitutional regulation, and to work on the diversification of its methodology. The materials of the article can be useful for the representatives of the legal science of the countries of the Romano-Germanic legal family, scholars in the field of constitutional comparative law, and students of law schools.

J	Perez-Gonzalez, L				Perez-Gonzalez, Luis			'Is climate science taking over the science?': A corpus-based study of competing stances on bias, dogma and expertise in the blogosphere	HUMANITIES & SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							3RD WAVE; PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT; POLITICS; COMMUNICATION	Climate change science has become an increasingly polarized site of controversy, where discussions on epistemological rigour are difficult to separate from debates on the impact that economic and political interests have on the production of evidence and the construction of knowledge. Little research has been conducted so far on the antagonistic discursive processes through which climate knowledge is being contested and traditional forms of expertise are being (de-)legitimized-whether by members of the scientific community or non-scientist actors. This corpus-based study contributes to previous scholarship on the climate science controversy in a number of respects. Unlike earlier studies based on the analysis of mainstream media articles, this paper interrogates a corpus of climate change blog posts published by scientists, journalists, researchers and lobbyists laying claim to core, contributory and interactional forms of expertise-as conceptualized within the third wave of science studies. Further, the corpus informing this study has been designed to reflect the complex and multivoiced nature of the climate knowledge production process. Drawn from five different blogs, the views represented are not confined to the two poles between which the entrenched dialectic of 'alarmists' versus 'deniers' is typically played out in the climate science debate. Following a systemic functional conceptualization of dialogic engagement as a means of positioning authorial voices vis-a-vis competing perspectives construed and referenced in a text, this paper reports on bloggers' use of three lexical items (bias, dogma and peer review) to expose their reliance on (non-)epistemic values. Concordances and a range of visualization tools are used to gain systematic insights into the network of lexical choices that obtain around these items, and to gauge whether/how bloggers construct coherent authorial subjectivities in a bid to claim expert status and/or question the recognition of other players in the debate.

First ladies are highly visible presidential surrogates. We argue that first ladies make direct appeals to selectively advance presidents' policy initiatives, and do so without being overly partisan. To support these claims, we present evidence from the public remarks of the last three first ladies whose husbands have completed their terms: Hillary Clinton, Laura Bush, and Michelle Obama. We use topic models to show that the remarks of first ladies are primarily concerned with policy, rather than ceremonial topics. We measure the partisanship of public remarks using a dictionary-based approach with Bayesian shrinkage and regularization to illustrate how the remarks of first ladies are not overly partisan. Our findings on the strategic communication of first ladies advance our understanding of the first ladyship and of the presidency.

Thus, based on texts of various documentary types, four lexical units were selected, linked to the semantic sphere of slavery, namely, slavery, slave, mulatto and pillory, considering the description and analysis of their contextual, lexicographic and historiographic meanings, as well as its discursive reverberations. In this bias, research with the lexicon takes us to an immaterial place of strong historical and political nuances, which are strengthened by the memories of resistance of the enslaved, updating and feeding this scenario and these scenes of other socio-cultural, ideological and political meanings.

J	Sopena, IG				Gonzalez Sopena, Inmaculada			Arabismos vinculados a la industria textil del reino de Granada a traves de sus documentos:aceituni,almaizar,alquicel,anafaya	NEOPHILOLOGUS			English	Article						Historical lexicography; History of the lexicon; Arabisms; Kingdom of Granada; Corpus linguistics		The objective of this article focuses on the historical-linguistics analysis of four lexical Arabisms attached to the lexical-semantic field of the textile industry of the Kingdom of Granada during the stage immediately after the Christian conquest (16th and 17th centuries):aceituni,almaizar,alquicelandanafaya. In order to do that, a corpus of municipal and administrative documents from the said territory have been elaborated (which corresponds to the current provinces of Malaga, Granada and Almeria). The variety of Spanish developed in that territory during the said period is characterized by the maintenance, even incorporation, of lexical loanwords taken from Arabic language against the general tendency of loss which it is observed in other Spanish-speaking areas due to the particular historical, political and social context developed there. Specifically, the factor that stands as a key to the maintenance of this specific type of lexicon is due to the enormous prestige and fame achieved by the textile industry of Granada.

J	Lavaert, S				Lavaert, Sonja			Adriaan Koerbagh, "An Excellent Mathematician but a Wicked Fellow"	CHURCH HISTORY AND RELIGIOUS CULTURE			English	Article						Adriaan Koerbagh; Baruch Spinoza; naturalism; freethought; metaphysics; religion critique; libertas philosophandi; philology; dictionary		In the spirit of the new naturalism, Adriaan Koerbagh defends in Een Ligt schijnende in duystere plaatsen (1668) the freedom to philosophize with a fundamental critique of religion and metaphysics. He links this criticism to the politically radical, anti-hierarchical idea of universal equality and freedom. Moreover, by writing in Dutch, he addresses a broad audience with this explosive mixture of ideas. At the very center of his naturalism is the idea of an indifferent God or nature. He criticizes, unmasks, and translates improper language that is aimed at deception and oppression, and leads to violence. His loanword dictionary Een Bloemhof van allerley lieflijkheyd sonder verdriet (1668) can be seen as the preparatory handwork to this critical project. Koerbagh thereby places himself in the line of the clandestine freethinkers such as Vanini, the anonymous authors of Theophrastus redivivus and De jure ecclesiasticorum, Spinoza, and the clandestine text written 'in the spirit of Spinoza,' Traite des trois imposteurs. I will illustrate this genealogical line and thus illuminate the significance of this (politically) subversive thinker for the radical Enlightenment.

J	LeRud, L				LeRud, Lizzy			Radical Revision: Rewriting Feminism with This Bridge Called My Back and Kate Rushin's "The Bridge Poem"	TULSA STUDIES IN WOMENS LITERATURE			English	Article								This essay argues that self-revision and republication are political as well as aesthetic strategies for feminist women of color, especially poets, writing after the white feminist and Black separatist movements of the 1960s and 1970s. To trace these strategies and uncover their effects, this essay maps the publishing history of "The Bridge Poem" by Kate Rushin, the title poem to This Bridge Called My Back (1981), alongside the poetics and political theories of This Bridge Called My Back editors Cherrie Moraga and Gloria Anzaldua, as well as others including Toni Cade Bambara, Audre Lorde, Adrienne Rich, Rita Dove, and Melissa Harris-Perry. With its exhortation to "Stretch or drown / Evolve or die," Rushin's poem epitomizes practices of radical self-revision, which are underscored by the fact that the poem takes its own injunction quite literally, changing in structure and diction throughout its publishing history. Attending to the revision practices of Rushin and her cohort reveals that feminist theories of revisionism are themselves the result of these theorists rewriting specific sections of critical texts over time, a practice grounded in their commitment to persistent social justice activism. Ultimately, these women's writings become creative spaces where authors and others demand and act out political transformations by first transforming texts.

J	Van der Walt, A; Van Rooy, B				Van der Walt, Amanda; Van Rooy, Bertus			Taboo language use as a key element in the construction of a zef identity	TYDSKRIF VIR GEESTESWETENSKAPPE			Afrikaans	Article						zef identity; masculinity; zef; hegemonic masculinity; language use; lexicon; corpus; taboo words; taboo domains; sexual metaphors; vulgar language	DIE-ANTWOORD; MASCULINITIES; POLITICS; GENDER	Masculinity (Benwell 2004; Connell 2016; Connell & Messerschmidt 2005; Kiesling 1996; Messerschmidt 2019), including Afrikaner masculinity (Du Pisani 2001, 2004, 2013; Swart 1998) has been thoroughly researched across the social sciences. Male identity, as it manifests itself in the South African zef subculture, has also come under investigation (Du Preez 2011; Krueger 2012), however, the role of language use in the creation of such a zef identity has not yet been researched. This article investigates how protest masculinity is projected and maintained on the WatKykJy?-blog, a satiric online environment, through language use, and more pointedly, the use of taboo words. This projected masculinity also relates closely to what is perceived as important in the identity of a zefmale, which in itself is a reaction to traditional Afrikaner identity and the negative associations it acquired in the post-apartheid years. The WKJ?-corpus is used to conduct the analysis. The corpus consists of 1,4 million words and has been divided into one-year periods, starting at the year 2000 and ending in 2017. A total of 50 texts have been selected randomly and analysed by hand in order to find and expand the taboo domains set out by Stapleton (2010) and van Huyssteen (1996). Apart from the scatological, blasphemous and sexual domains identified in previous research, two more domains (weather and plant domains) have been identified from the corpus. The weather domain is mainly employed to refer to violent behaviour, although it is occasionally used to express surprise. The plant domain is more frequently associated with the use of sexual metaphors. The analysis indicates that WKJ?-readers and -authors frequently use taboo language A on the blog. total of 29 389 taboo words are identified, which translates into a relative frequency of 20 taboo words per 1 000 words. Individual lexical items with the highest frequency are fok fuck' (1 709) and its derived form fokken fucking' (5631), as well as kak 'shit' (3162), poes 'pussy' (1249) and moerse 'huge' (literally 'mothers) (1128). The semantic domain that is the most productive taboo domain is the sexual domain, where taboo words with a strong sexual connotation are used quite liberally, alongside words that are metaphorically invoked to convey sexual meanings as well, such as names of animals, e.g. haas 'hare teef 'bitch', kat 'cat', and goose for females and slang 'snake', bastard or vol 'bird 'for males. Women andior their genitals are also portrayed as edible objects, such as vy fig', cherry or koek 'cake', while men are represented as the active eaters thereof. Sexual acts are metaphorically represented as if they inflict pain on women, e.g. brand 'burn or saag 'saw'. The second most frequent domain is the scatological, where euphemisms and dysphemisms are encountered, such as the euphemism modderotter uhrol (literally "rolling out the mud beaver") for bowel movement, and the dysphemism kakhuis (literally "shit house")Ar toilet. The third domain of taboo words draws on weather, especially stormy weather, and is often used to refer to people (die dom donner, "the stupid thunder") or to fighting (ek fokken bliksem julle almal "I flicking thunder (verb) you all"). These words have moderate taboo value in Afrikaans, but form a template for extension to sexual terms with a meaning in the fighting domain, with much higher taboo value, such as voordat ek iemand gaan poes "before I go and pussy (verb) somebody". The fourth domain, the final one with non-negligible frequency, is the domain of blasphemous word use, including the plain forms Jesus and Here 'Lord', but also euphemistic spelling variants such as Jissis 'Jesus' and Jim 'Lord', which are typically employed as interjections at clause boundaries. Taboo language is used purposefully and deliberately to undermine the puritan values that are part of the traditional hegemonic Afrikaner masculinity, and also expose the duplicity and contradictions thereof The protest masculinity that is offered instead emphasises physicality, but shares the homophobic and hierarchical gender role components of hegemonic masculinity. The male participants on the website are constructing and projecting a zef identity, for the purpose of creating a post-apartheid identity that denounces any political alliances but rejects the hegemonic masculinity of the traditional Afrikaner male associated with the apartheid era. Yet, the persistent use of irony makes it ambiguous whether the alternative zef masculinity is really held up as new model.

Research on the Big Five has produced methods to reliably assess personality traits from text, but the development of comparable tools for personal values is still in the early stages. Based on the Schwartz theory of basic human values, we developed a dictionary for the automatic assessment of references to personal values in text. To refine and validate the dictionary, we used Facebook updates, blog posts, essays, and book chapters authored by over 180 000 individuals. The results show high reliability for the dictionary and a pattern of correlations between the value types in line with the circumplex structure. We found small to moderate (r(s) = .1-.4) but consistent correlations between dictionary scores and self-reported scores for 7 out of 10 values. Correlations between the dictionary scores and age, gender, and political orientation of the author and scores for other established dictionaries mostly followed theoretical predictions. The Personal Values Dictionary can be used to assess references to value orientations in textual data, such as tweets, blog posts, or status updates, and will stimulate further research in methods to assess human basic values from text.

Rededication of an Arabic Panegyric by Judah al-Harizi	JOURNAL OF ARABIC LITERATURE			English	Article						panegyric; Judeo-Arabic; Jews; Arabic poetry; Jewish-Muslim relations; Ayyubid		This article studies two versions of an Arabic panegyric by the Jewish poet Judah al-Harizi, one preserved in Hebrew (Judeo-Arabic) script and the other in Arabic script in a biographical dictionary by al-Mubarak ibn A.mad al-Mawsili (1197-1256). The Judeo-Arabic version was dedicated to a Jewish physician. While the version transmitted by al-Mawsili does not have a named addressee, it was likely dedicated to a Muslim. By reading the two versions as iterations of the same basic text accommodated to specific circumstances, this article demonstrates the ways in which the author modulated rhetoric to fit the social positions of the respective addressees. The article studies the dynamics of inter-religious praise and the Jewish internalization of Islamic concepts of political legitimacy.

However, current research is concerned with one-time experiments and can not elucidate long-term effects of iterated consultations. Our argument is that consultations have learning effects over time. We test our argument using the German procedure for electricity grid demand planning as a case. Using dictionary coding and a quantitative analysis, supplemented by a qualitative text analysis, we show that participants get better in framing their contributions by using the "right" keywords. Hence, consultations evolve over time and improve in terms of the output legitimacy they generate.

J	Karjus, A; Blythe, RA; Kirby, S; Smith, K				Karjus, Andres; Blythe, Richard A.; Kirby, Simon; Smith, Kenny			Quantifying the dynamics of topical fluctuations in language	LANGUAGE DYNAMICS AND CHANGE			English	Article						advection; lexical dynamics; language change; language evolution; frequency; topic modeling; corpus-based	EVOLUTION; FREQUENCY; SELECTION; WORDS	The availability of large diachronic corpora has provided the impetus for a growing body of quantitative research on language evolution and meaning change. The central quantities in this research are token frequencies of linguistic elements in texts, with changes in frequency taken to reflect the popularity or selective fitness of an element. However, corpus frequencies may change for a wide variety of reasons, including purely random sampling effects, or because corpora are composed of contemporary media and fiction texts within which the underlying topics ebb and flow with cultural and socio-political trends. In this work, we introduce a simple model for controlling for topical fluctuations in corpora-the topical-cultural advection model-and demonstrate how it provides a robust baseline of variability in word frequency changes over time. We validate the model on a diachronic corpus spanning two centuries, and a carefully-controlled artificial language change scenario, and then use it to correct for topical fluctuations in historical time series. Finally, we use the model to show that the emergence of new words typically corresponds with the rise of a trending topic. This suggests that some lexical innovations occur due to growing communicative need in a subspace of the lexicon, and that the topical-cultural advection model can be used to quantify this.

J	Khemka, AK				Khemka, Anand Kumar			The Speech Genre of the Movie Announcement (On the Material of Movie Announcements of Indian Films)	TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL			Russian	Article						speech genre; virtual genre studies; movie announcement; Indian films; cinema; India		The aim of the work is to describe the speech genre of the movie announcement functioning in the Internet environment: to identify its main genre-forming and linguistic embodiment features. The material of the work consists of 200 movie announcements of Indian films written in Russian and posted on the website Indiankino net. The material was collected through a continuous sampling method. The speech genre is described on the basis of the model proposed by Tatyana Shmeleva. The model consists of 7 constitutive parameters (communicative goal, image of the author and image of the addressee, image of the past and image of the future, parameters of dictum content and linguistic embodiment); some other additional parameters are also included (composition and account of non-verbal means) due to the characteristics of the analyzed material. The movie announcement is a secondary, informative, advertising virtual speech genre with elements of an imperative speech genre, the purpose of which is not only to transmit brief information about the film, but also to influence the addressee. In the analyzed texts of film descriptions (actually announcements), four main compositional elements are distinguished: (1) title of the film; (2) exposition; (3) brief plot of the film; (4) denouement. In contrary to the studies of other researchers on movie announcements, the author's material does not contain such a structural element as the slogan. The analysis of the material shows that the main theme of Indian films and, respectively, their announcements is love. Other topics, such as crimes, blood feuds, social conflicts, murders, politics, etc. are also found to some extent in movie announcements of Indian films along with the theme of love. Movie announcements represent how events develop in the film, how the fate of the characters unfolds; thus, the dictum content of all the analyzed texts is based on event-based and logical propositions. The characteristic means of the linguistic embodiment of the speech genre of the movie announcement are revealed at the lexical, morphological and syntactic levels. The studied creolized texts of movie announcements have their own stable composition, content, and language means. The analysis of the movie announcements of Indian films shows that movie announcements of films in different countries may be constructed in different ways. There are no subtitles and slogans in the movie announcements for Indian films. Unlike other types of announcements (news announcements), movie announcements do not possess the feature of aggressiveness. The most specific means of the linguistic embodiment of movie announcements of Indian films are units of the lexical-semantic field "love", the words life, fate, words of nationally specific nature, as well as an almost complete absence of exclamatory sentences.

Published by People's Education Press, the textbooks serve as the core teaching material for literacy education of primary school children. Informed by language socialisation and literacy studies, this paper examines what texts and topics are included in textbooks that introduce child-readers to environmental literacy, how child readers are positioned as (ir)responsible environmental actors, and what text-types and features are used to socialise children to become environmentally conscious individuals. To understand the ideological constructs of environmental literacy,intertextualityis employed to analyse how meaning is derived by revealing the interconnectedness of text production with the broader socio-political issues. Through content analysis, the article examines particularly how text features such as texttypes, lexical choices, grammatical elements and generic structures are used in the textbooks to reflect environmental issues and develop children's awareness. The ideological orientations serve as a framework for socialising children into environmentally conscious individuals. The article enhances our understanding of the role textbooks play in literacy education, as they not only provide materials for literacy learning and teaching, but also entail a socialisation process that shapes individuals' environmental perception of the world.

I use a small corpus of well-documented German Federal Constitutional Court opinions on European integration to compare the machine-generated scores to scholarly accounts of the case law and legal expert ratings. Naive Bayes, Word2Vec, Correspondence Analysis and Latent Semantic Analysis appear to perform well. Less convincing are the performance of Wordscores, ML Affinity and lexicon-based sentiment analysis. While both the high-dimensionality of judicial texts and the validation of computer-based jurisprudential estimates pose major methodological challenges, I conclude that automated text-scaling methods hold out great promise for legal research.

We apply techniques from natural language processing (lexicons, word embeddings, topic models) to 15 U.S. history textbooks widely used in Texas between 2015 and 2017, studying their depiction of historically marginalized groups. We find that Latinx people are rarely discussed, and the most common famous figures are nearly all White men. Lexicon-based approaches show that Black people are described as performing actions associated with low agency and power. Word embeddings reveal that women tend to be discussed in the contexts of work and the home. Topic modeling highlights the higher prominence of political topics compared with social ones. We also find that more conservative counties tend to purchase textbooks with less representation of women and Black people. Building on a rich tradition of textbook analysis, we release our computational toolkit to support new research directions.

D-BullyRumbler: a safety rumble strip to resolve online denigration bullying using a hybrid filter-wrapper approach	MULTIMEDIA SYSTEMS			English	Article; Early Access						Cyberbullying; Denigration; Machine learning; Filter-wrapper; Rumor; Social media	CYBERBULLYING DETECTION	Denigration is a specialized form of cyberbullying which describes a recurrent, sustained and intentional attempt to damage the victim's reputation or ruin the friendships that he or she has by spreading unfounded gossip or rumors online. It is the most common bullying tactic involving character assassination of public figures like celebrities and politicians. As a comprehensive approach to match to the scale of social media this research put forwards a D-BullyRumbler model for automatic detection and resolution of denigration cyberbullying in online textual content using a hybrid of lexicon-based and machine learning-based techniques. The model processes textual, content-based and user-based features to uncover denigration from two perspectives. Firstly, a direct explicit content analysis is done to look for denigration markers as features for model training and testing. Concurrently, potentially harmful messages, rumors, are identified as candidates and examined for target profile type to reveal the case of denigration. An additional OR operation is done to maintain the holistic framework. Another novelty of the work includes the use of hybrid filter-wrapper method, Chi-square filter and cuckoo search wrapper algorithm to improve the performance of reputation rumor classification module. Experimental results on social media datasets show the superior classification performance. The results validate the effectiveness of the proposed model which facilitates timely intervention by buzzing an alarm to the moderators and further forming a rumble safety strip to inhibit the production and dissemination of inappropriate content to protect the victims.

In recent years, sentiment analysis has not only emerged under knowledge fusion in the big data era, but has also become a popular research topic in the area of artificial intelligence and machine learning. This study used the Militarylife PTT board of Taiwan's largest online forum as the source of its experimental data. The purpose of this study was to construct a sentiment analysis framework and processes for social media in order to propose a self-developed military sentiment dictionary for improving sentiment classification and analyze the performance of different deep learning models with various parameter calibration combinations. The experimental results show that the accuracy and F1-measure of the model that combines existing sentiment dictionaries and the self-developed military sentiment dictionary are better than the results from using existing sentiment dictionaries only. Furthermore, the prediction model trained using the activation function, Tanh, and when the number of Bi-LSTM network layers is two, the accuracy and F1-measure have an even better performance for sentiment classification.

LessLex: Linking Multilingual Embeddings to SenSe Representations of LEXical Items	COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS			English	Article							WORD; SIMILARITY; CORPUS	We present LESSLEX, a novel multilingual lexical resource. Different from the vast majority of existing approaches, we ground our embeddings on a sense inventory made available from the BabelNet semantic network. In this setting, multilingual access is governed by the mapping of terms onto their underlying sense descriptions, such that all vectors co-exist in the same semantic space. As a result, for each term we have thus the "blended" terminological vector along with those describing all senses associated to that term. LESSLEX has been tested on three tasks relevant to lexical semantics: conceptual similarity, contextual similarity, and semantic text similarity. We experimented over the principal data sets for such tasks in their multilingual and crosslingual variants, improving on or closely approaching state-of-the-art results. We conclude by arguing that LESSLEX vectors may be relevant for practical applications and for research on conceptual and lexical access and competence.

J	Denisova, GL				Denisova, Galina L.			Precedent Phenomena in the Great Patriotic War Political Cartoon as a Creolized Text	VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA FILOLOGIYA-TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF PHILOLOGY			Russian	Article						political cartoon; creolized text; text categories; precedent phenomenon; precedent text; precedent situation; precedent name; source spheres of precedent phenomena		The article deals with precedent phenomena in the Great Patriotic War political cartoons as a creolized text. The author determines source domains and functions of the precedent phenomena in the messages of the cartoons in connection with the period of the Great Patriotic War. Considering political cartoons as a creolized text, the author makes use of methods which linguists apply to verbal texts during the analysis of messages in the form of a political cartoon. First of all, it is L.A. Nozdrina's method for text structure analysis, which is complemented by definitional, semantic, and contextual analyses when lexical meanings of words are studied. As a result of the analysis, it has been revealed that precedent phenomena from the following source domains are used in the cartoons: the history of the Homeland, the Russian song fund, and literature. The latter source domain is represented by subgroups: fairy tales, fables, and the artistic prose. The analysis of the functions of precedent phenomena in the messages has shown that the precedent phenomena are elements of referential, temporal, local, and modal text structures, and they participate in the expression of the textual categories of the message. As an element of the reference structure, the precedent phenomenon contributes to the characterization of text referents and to the disclosure of the main idea of the message. Precedent phenomena, projected on certain points of the time axis in the history of Russia, can be used as temporal indicators, as indirect retrospective links to reconstruct the direction to the past, i.e. they participate in temporal text organization. Precedent phenomena as elements of the local structure make it possible to create a specific space of the political cartoon, a visible picture filled with details. In the modal structure of the message, precedent phenomena are used for introducing the author's position into the message. The multiplicity of associative fields of the precedent phenomena as a property that forms the basis for interpretation (which presupposes certain knowledge on the part of the addressee), and the specific character of these phenomena's insertion into the message (semiotically) give the authors of political cartoons an opportunity to deliver the main idea of the message to the addressee in a capacious and laconic form and to express its emotional and evaluative component.

Human rights attitudes have been shown to be related to political ideology, but there have been few studies investigating their relationship with morality. Using moral foundations theory, we examine whether morals can predict human rights attitudes across two studies. The first study used questionnaires to show that human rights are based exclusively on individualizing moral foundations; however, increases in individualizing and decreases in binding foundations predict increases in human rights endorsement. Moral foundations also mediated the relationship between political identification and human rights. Both individualizing and binding foundations performed a role in explaining the lower endorsement of human rights by conservatives as compared to liberals. The second study used textual analysis of newspaper articles to show that human-rights-related articles contained more moral language than other articles, in particular for the individualizing foundations. Conservative newspapers had a greater use of binding foundations in human rights articles than liberal newspapers.

Although, English is the most common language used to share views on social media, however, other vicinity based languages are also used by locals. Thus, it is also required to incorporate the views in such languages along with widely used languages for revealing better insights from data. This research focuses on the sentimental analysis of social media multilingual textual data to discover the intensity of the sentiments of extremism. Our study classifies the incorporated textual views into any of four categories, including high extreme, low extreme, moderate, and neutral, based on their level of extremism. Initially, a multilingual lexicon with the intensity weights is created. This lexicon is validated from domain experts and it attains 88% accuracy for validation. Subsequently, Multinomial Naive Bayes and Linear Support Vector Classifier algorithms are employed for classification purposes. Overall, on the underlying multilingual dataset, Linear Support Vector Classifier outperforms with an accuracy of 82%.

An Efficient Model for Mining Outlier Opinions	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED COMPUTER SCIENCE AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Opinion mining; sentiment analysis; anomaly detection; outliers; reviews; text analysis; natural language processing; rapidminer		In the internet era, opinion mining became a critical technique used in many applications. The internet offers a featured chance for users to express and share their views and experiences anywhere and at any time through various methods as online reviews, personal blogs, Facebook, Twitter and companies' websites. Such treasure of online data generated by users play an essential role in decision-making process and have the ability to make radical changes in several fields. Although the opinionated text can provide significantly invaluable information for the wide community either are individuals, business, or government, the outlier or anomaly opinions could have the same impact but in opposite manner which harm these fields. Consequently, there is an urge to develop techniques to detect the outlier opinions and avoid their negative impacts on several application domains which rely on opinion mining. In this paper, an efficient model for mining outlier opinions has been proposed. The proposed MOoM model, stands for Mining Outlier Opinion Model, offers for the first time the ability to mine outlier opinions from product's free-text reviews. Accordingly, it can help the decision makers to improve the overall sentiment analysis process and perform further analysis on the outlier opinions to get better understanding for them and avoid their negative impact. The proposed model consists of three modules; Data preprocessing module, Opinion mining module and outlier opinions detection module. The proposed model utilizes the lexicon-based approach to extract sentiment polarity from each review in the dataset. Also, it uses the Distance-based outlier detection algorithm to produce a graded list of review holders with outlier opinions. Experimental study is presented to evaluate the proposed model and the results proved the model's ability to detect outlier opinions in the product reviews effectively. The model is adaptable to be used in other fields rather than product's reviews by customizing its modules' layers.

J	Negron, NV				Negron, Ninel Valderrama			(Hi)Story in the Margins: Jose Rizal's Footnotes to Antonio Morga's Chronicle	LABORHISTORICO			English	Article						Counterhistory; Footnotes; Marginalia; Jose Rizal; Antonio Morga		A milestone in the Philippines has been the facsimile of Morga's chronicle Sucesos de las Islas Filipinas annotated by Jose Rizal in 1890. Scholars have analyzed how Rizal's use of footnotes told a counterhistory of the Spanish conquest. His project is semantic in nature and sought to destabilize, at least momentarily, the key concepts of the Hispanic theological-political monarchy. However, I argue that his criticism not only focused on the lexicon but went further, Rizal's use of footnotes sought to disrupt Western academic structures by appropriating them. His innovation was to do so with a colonial text in the 19th century Philippines. The footnotes of Rizal add the Filipino version, that is, two different versions engaged in visual rivalry on the same page. This paper analyzes the Rizal edition based on the materiality of the text, namely the how it operates in the format and its medium. The body of text is marginalized, whereas the story at the margins becomes visually relevant. This effort represents an epistemological rupture of the unit of the metropolitan narrative with the conversion of the Filipino from an object of study to a subject that gain agency.

J	Gulnerman, AG; Karaman, H				Gulnerman, Ayse Giz; Karaman, Himmet			Spatial Reliability Assessment of Social Media Mining Techniques with Regard to Disaster Domain-Based Filtering	ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION			English	Article						volunteered geographic information; spatial assessment; spatial similarity index; sentiment analysis	SENTIMENT ANALYSIS; ASSOCIATION; TWITTER; COEFFICIENTS; SIMILARITY; CITIZENS; USERS	The data generated by social media such as Twitter are classified as big data and the usability of those data can provide a wide range of resources to various study areas including disaster management, tourism, political science, and health. However, apart from the acquisition of the data, the reliability and accuracy when it comes to using it concern scientists in terms of whether or not the use of social media data (SMD) can lead to incorrect and unreliable inferences. There have been many studies on the analyses of SMD in order to investigate their reliability, accuracy, or credibility, but that have not dealt with the filtering techniques applied to with the data before creating the results or after their acquisition. This study provides a methodology for detecting the accuracy and reliability of the filtering techniques for SMD and then a spatial similarity index that analyzes spatial intersections, proximity, and size, and compares them. Finally, we offer a comparison that shows the best combination of filtering techniques and similarity indices to create event maps of SMD by using the Getis-Ord Gi* technique. The steps of this study can be summarized as follows: an investigation of domain-based text filtering techniques for dealing with sentiment lexicons, machine learning -based sentiment analyses on reliability, and developing intermediate codes specific to domain-based studies; then, by using various similarity indices, the determination of the spatial reliability and accuracy of maps of the filtered social media data. The study offers the best combination of filtering, mapping, and spatial accuracy investigation methods for social media data, especially in the case of emergencies, where urgent spatial information is required. As a result, a new similarity index based on the spatial intersection, spatial size, and proximity relationships is introduced to determine the spatial accuracy of the fine-filtered SMD. The motivation for this research is to develop the ability to create an incidence map shortly after a disaster event such as a bombing.

J	Li, L				Li, Long			Shifts of agency in translation: a case study of the Chinese translation of Wild Swans	META			English	Article						transitivity; agency; theme; voice; ideology		This paper calls for a reconsideration of transitivity as a useful analytical tool in descriptive translation studies, especially for the investigation of the translation of agency. Transitivity is the ensemble of lexico-grammatical resources that "represent reality in language" (Eggins 2001/2005: 206). Such choices in translation have been usefully explored by a number of translation scholars with a strong orientation towards Systemic Functional Linguistics (SFL), although there has not been much recent scholarly interest within the wider community of translation studies (TS), perhaps due to the perceived complexity of SFL's analytical framework. This paper returns to transitivity analysis for its continued relevance to TS, especially for those interested in uncovering the way agency, ideology, characterization and narrative are manifested in text. This paper incorporates new linguistic methodologies of analysing transitivity in combination with additional linguistic systems of VOICE, THEME, and MODALITY because this combination allows for a more holistic view of transitivity. Focusing on the translation of Mao's agency at the beginning of the Cultural Revolution in Chang's politically volatile autobiography, Wild Swans, it has found dramatic shifts in the characterization of Mao in the Chinese translation by Pu Zhang, published in Taiwan, which alters the overall narrative. This paper proposes a categorization of equivalences and shifts of linguistic agency based on a text-based analysis, thus contributing to a more systematic categorisation of the translation of agency.

However, this should start from the earliest stages of education, promoting an effective teaching/learning process of key concepts for sustainable development. Accordingly, the general objective of this research was to analyze the concepts of water, energy and waste in the primary education curriculum (6-12 years) in Spain. A qualitative research approach was followed, with an exploratory and descriptive design. A system of categories was established for each of the concepts under study, with the aim of classifying the references found, analyzing their integration into the different subjects, academic courses, curricular elements and levels of cognitive demand required of the students. The results of the lexicographical analysis of the content reveal that the regulations governing primary education in Spain mainly focus on the concept of energy and, to a lesser extent, on the concepts of water and waste. In addition, cognitive levels of knowledge and comprehension predominate based on the taxonomy used. The results suggest the need to develop initiatives for the educational framework that promote not only learning, but also attitudes and behaviors that contribute to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

Much progress has been made, but-as in other areas of research-this work has been criticized for relying on small and statistically unrepresentative samples and the use of reactive, self-report measures that lack ecological validity. In an effort to overcome these limitations, we employed automated text analytic methods to investigate the spontaneous, naturally occurring use of language in nearly 25,000 Twitter users. We derived 27 hypotheses from the literature on political psychology and tested them using 32 individual dictionaries. In 23 cases, we observed significant differences in the linguistic styles of liberals and conservatives. For instance, liberals used more language that conveyed benevolence, whereas conservatives used more language pertaining to threat, power, tradition, resistance to change, certainty, security, anger, anxiety, and negative emotion in general. In 17 cases, there were also significant effects of ideological extremity. For instance, moderates used more benevolent language, whereas extremists used more language pertaining to inhibition, tentativeness, affiliation, resistance to change, certainty, security, anger, anxiety, negative affect, swear words, and death-related language. These research methods, which are easily adaptable, open up new and unprecedented opportunities for conducting unobtrusive research in psycholinguistics and political psychology with large and diverse samples.

AMAZONIA INVESTIGA			English	Article						public administration; innovations; sociolectic neologisms; professional derivatives; communication; communicative barriers	DISCOURSE	This article is devoted to the study of the formation and functioning of professional innovations in the language of Russian public administration, reflecting the manifestation of tendencies toward standardization and informality in the choice of lexical items and syntactic constructions. To conduct a research, we used methods of linguistic observation and description, methods of component, comparative and lexicographic analysis, as well as the methodology of complex cognitively oriented synchronous diachronic analysis of language subsystems and their units. Printed text versions of speeches by people in the Government and the Federal Assembly of the Russian Federation were the materials for the study. A language analysis of the new public administration made it possible to single out a whole series of lexical-semantic, word-formative, morphological and syntactic innovations, which are identification marks of the studied subsystem and necessary elements of the thesaurus of a civil servant personality. A special group of language innovations of the new public administration is formed by the so-called thematically reoriented semantic neologisms. It is established that the language development of the new public administration is on the way to expand the field of functioning and strengthening its influence on the linguistic taste formation of Russian society. It is noted that the written form of communication in the field of public administration is significantly influenced by the oral colloquial element, and the results of this effect are manifested in all aspects: from lexical to communicative-pragmatic. Researchers are particularly worried about the consolidation in the professional language of the studied sphere of linguistic items violating linguistic and ethical-moral standards that create barriers for effective communication. In conclusion, it is unacceptable to actualize reduced professional language elements that contribute to the inefficiency of communication between representatives of authority and the community.

J	Ulanov, AV				Ulanov, A., V			Elements of political discourse in the Russian military discourse of the early 20th century (based on the analysis of regional texts)	SIBIRSKII FILOLOGICHESKII ZHURNAL			Russian	Article						military discourse; political discourse; regional Russian language		Military and political discourses refer to institutional varieties of discourse and have similar features that indicate the interdiscursive interaction of linguistic means used within these discourses. The work aims to see how the signs and means of expression coincide in the two types of institutional discourse. The presence of linguistic units of the nomenclature subject suggests that the political discourse permeates the military one during the 19th and early 20th centuries. The interaction of military and political discourses is found in the regional Russian language of Siberia at this stage of the Russian language development. Political discourse includes linguistic means of nomenclature and official character, which are the means of regulation of the official power. Considering the availability of such means in the military discourse of Siberia at the end of the 19th - the beginning of the 20th century, the presence of military-administrative terms in the Russian language testifies to the expansion of political, and in particular, political discourse in the military discourse. In the linguistic reality, the interconnection between military and political discourses is revealed in the fact that nominations are correlated simultaneously with both military and political discourse. The paper identifies the main thematic groups of nominations, revealing the strongest influence of the administrative language. The interaction of military and administrative discourse in the regional Russian language of Siberia is reflected in the framework of interpenetration of lexical units, creation of interdiscursive models of semantic wordformation, the presence of speech complexes with the semantics of imperativeness - verbs with semantics "management" in the grammatical structure of military discourse.

Understanding the patients experience of care-received is key for providing better health care. With prevailing usage of social media applications, patients are expressing their experience over social media. This patient authored text is a free-unstructured data which is available over social media in large chunks. To extract the sentiments from this huge data, a domain-specific dictionary is required to get better accuracy. The proposed approach defines a new domain-specific dictionary and uses this in sentiment scoring to enhance the overall sentiment classification on patient authored text. We conducted experiments on the proposed approach using NHS Choices dataset and compared it with popular classifiers like linear regression, stochastic gradient descent, dictionary-based approaches: VADER and AFINN. The results prove that the proposed approach is an effective strategy for sentiment analysis over patient authored text which helps in improving the classification accuracy.

J	Araujo, M; Pereira, A; Benevenuto, F				Araujo, Matheus; Pereira, Adriano; Benevenuto, Fabricio			A comparative study of machine translation for multilingual sentence-level sentiment analysis	INFORMATION SCIENCES			English	Article						Sentiment analysis; Multilingual; Machine translation; Online social networks; Opinion mining		Sentiment analysis has become a key tool for several social media applications, including, analysis of user's opinions about products and services, support for politics during campaigns and even identification of market trending. Multiple existing sentiment analysis methods explore different techniques, usually relying on lexical resources or learning approaches. Despite the significant interest in this theme and amount of research efforts in the field, almost all existing methods are designed to work with only English content. Most current strategies in other languages consist of adapting existing lexical resources, without presenting proper validations and basic baseline comparisons. In this work, we take a different step into this field. We focus on evaluating existing efforts proposed to do language specific sentiment analysis with a simple yet effective baseline approach. To do it, we evaluated sixteen methods for sentence-level sentiment analysis proposed for English, and compared them with three language-specific methods. Based on fourteen human labeled language-specific datasets, we provide an extensive quantitative analysis of existing multilingual approaches. Our results suggest that simply translating the input text in a specific language to English and then using one of the existing best methods developed for English can be better than the existing language-specific approach evaluated. We also rank methods according to their prediction performance and identify those that acquired the best results using machine translation across different languages. As a final contribution to the research community, we release our codes, datasets, and the iFeel 3.0 system, a Web framework and tool for multilingual sentence-level sentiment analysis'. We hope our system sets up a new baseline for future sentence-level methods developed in a wide set of languages. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

A lexicon has consolidated, and key sets of debates have been identified. Chief among these are questions of kinship, the intersection of technologies and local moral worlds, and the circulation of gametes and technological know-how. The recent publication of five books in the Berghahn series on Fertility, Reproduction and Sexuality offers an opportunity to think about new affordances and futures for research. We review the texts and suggest several strands for research, concluding that anthropological objects do not become saturated by our knowledge of them and that ARTs will remain fertile ground for thought.

J	Baker, M				Baker, Mona			Rehumanizing the migrant: the translated past as a resource for refashioning the contemporary discourse of the (radical) left	PALGRAVE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article								This study examines conceptions of outsiders to the polity, focusing on the lexical items migrant(s), refugee(s), and exile(s) in both internet- and print-based sources. Drawing primarily on a subsection of the Genealogies Internet Corpus consisting of left-wing sources, I argue that left-wing politics is currently caught up in the rhetoric of the right and of mainstream institutions in society, largely reproducing the same discursive patterns even as it sets out to challenge them. Dominant patterns in left-wing Internet sources reveal, for example, that the economic migrant vs. political refugee distinction enforced by mainstream institutions remains largely intact, that the assumption of a "refugee crisis" unfolding in Europe is accepted at face value, and that the left is entangled in the same politics of labeling imposed by the right, reproducing designations such as "undocumented migrants" uncritically. Refugees and migrants, moreover, are represented as victims with no agency, are discussed in legal terms that serve to dehumanize them, and are repeatedly "quantified" as a homogenous and potentially problematic category. Acknowledging the contagious nature of dominant discourses and the difficulty of finding an alternative language with which to argue against established institutional rhetoric, the study further explores historical models that appear more consistent with the values espoused by left-wing politics today. It examines a subcorpus of modern English translations of ancient Greek texts such as Thucydides' The Peloponnesian War and Herodotus's Histories to demonstrate the viability of adopting a different conceptualization of refugees and other outsiders to the polity that may be drawn from classical antiquity-and/or from nineteenth- and early twentieth-century receptions of texts originating in classical antiquity-and the possibility of developing an alternative discourse with which to speak about migrants in the present.

J	Karimullah, KI				Karimullah, Kamran, I			Editions, translations, transformations: refashioning the Arabic Aristotle in Egypt and metropolitan Europe, 1940-1980	PALGRAVE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article								Like translations, critical editions can play an important role in the language-mediated evolution of political concepts. This paper offers a case-study of a modern edition of Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics by the famous twentieth-century Egyptian philosopher and father of 'Arab existentialism' Abd al-Rahman Badawi (d. 2002). It draws on ancient Greek and medieval Arabic corpora developed by the Genealogies of Knowledge project and a modern Arabic corpus accessible through Sketch Engine to examine the lexical patterning of key political items relating to the concept of citizen in the Arabic and Greek versions of Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics. This corpus-based analysis of lexical patterns is contextualised against discursive and disciplinary parameters that shaped Badawi's edition. Supplementing this collocational analysis of relevant lexical items with a more traditional analysis of Badawi's paratexts, I argue that the editing process produces a hybrid 'third text' that is neither a transcription of the original manuscript nor a reconstruction of the manuscript's archetype. The paper concludes that, like translations, editions transform the texts they are based on.

Hybrid Approach for Sentiment Analysis of Twitter Posts Using a Dictionary-based Approach and Fuzzy Logic Methods: Study Case on Cloud Service Providers	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL ON SEMANTIC WEB AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Cloud Service; Dictionary; Fuzzy-Logic; Hashtag; Sentiment Analysis; Tweet; Twitter; Word Polarity		Recently, sentiment analysis of social media has become a hot topic because of the huge amount of information that is provided in these networks. Twitter is a popular social media application offers businesses and government the opportunities to share and acquire information. This article proposes a technique that aims at measuring customers' satisfaction with cloud service providers, based on their tweets. Existing techniques focused on classifying sentimental text as either positive or negative, while the proposed technique classifies the tweets into five categories to provide better information. A hybrid approach of dictionary-based and Fuzzy Inference Process (FIP) is developed for this purpose. This direction was selected for its advantages and flexibility in addressing complex problems, using terms that reflect on human behaviors and experiences. The proposed hybrid-based technique used fuzzy systems in order to accurately identify the sentiment of the input text while addressing the challenges that are facing sentiment analysis using various fuzzy parameters.

THE SONGS OF THE SHENEHEN BURYATS	TOMSKII ZHURNAL LINGVISTICHESKIKH I ANTROPOLOGICHESKIKH ISSLEDOVANII-TOMSK JOURNAL OF LINGUISTICS AND ANTHROPOLOGY			Russian	Article						songs of Shenehen Buryats; emigration of the Buryats; hymn songs; written culture of the Buryats		For the first time, the article discusses the subject matter, features of the language of the songs of the Shenehen Buryats in the author's translation into Russian. The uniqueness of the Shenehen Buryats, who have been living in China for about 100 years, is that they have preserved their authentic culture: language, traditional Old Mongolian script, national costume, traditions, customs and folk songs. For a long time, the topic about Buryat emigration was banned. The article also highlights the reasons and history of the emigration of the Aga Buryats to the Shenehen locality of the China, based on the work of Bodongut Abida (1983), written in Old Mongolian script. The migration of the Buryat diaspora to Bargu was ethnically protective in nature and was associated with political events in Russia at the beginning of the 20th century. The presence of the genre of odic songs (magtaal) in the song tradition testifies to their developed system of written culture, the distinction between written and oral texts, and the stylistic differentiation of the language of the lyrics. It has been revealed that the vocabulary of the Magtaals is sustained in a high style with an orientation towards the norms of the Old Mongolian language. An analysis of the field materials testifies to the mastery of versification of nameless poets, strictly observing the initial alliteration in strophes, using various figures of speech, the entire arsenal of grammatical forms to convey shades of semantics of the lexical unit. This allows us to argue that the lyrics are created and transmitted not only verbally, but also in writing long before the 1917 revolution.	[Badmaeva, L.

Specifics of Finnish web news texts: structure and language exposure mechanism	VESTNIK UGROVEDENIYA-BULLETIN OF UGRIC STUDIES			Russian	Article						Finno-Ugric languages; web text; lexical means of expression; referent situation; precedent phenomenon		Introduction: the article explores the structural features and language means of expression of web news texts of the Finnish online publication website YLE. For the first time Finnish web texts are studied. The need to research the linguistic mechanism of influence of Finnish-language web texts on the readership explains the urgency of the article. Objective: to identify design features and nationally specific vocabulary of Finnish web news texts. Research materials: 30 news web texts of social and political content in the Finnish language from the information program Yle Uutiset. The total volume of the texts is 145 567 print characters, also each article contains about 600-700 words, i.e. on average 5-6 thousand print characters. The chronological framework of the material under study dates from January to April 2020. Results and novelty of the research: the scientific novelty is that it is the first time web texts on the material in Finnish language are studied to identify the peculiarities of the language mechanism and means of influence on the addressee. The set of media topics is characterized by their stable character. Ecocentrism is a nationally specific topic for the Finnish media. The referent situation includes specific referents that allow value reinterpretation of the situation. The specificity of web texts consists of the combination of several genres: news and analytical text and historical narrative. Functional and genre specificity of web news texts is the hybridity of technical methods of their creation. The structural features of web texts are the use of questions to an imaginary interlocutor (dubitation), presence of hyperlinks, photo and video materials. Media reconstructions and interpretation of the events of the surrounding world are culturally specific. There is widespread use of indefinite-personal, general-personal and impersonal constructions at the language level. The most common language means and methods of influence on the addressee in Finnish web texts are introduction of evaluative situation in the factual one, use of evaluative adjectives and nouns, metaphors and allusions.

Nine judges divided into three groups rated the words in two parameters (pertinence and relevance of each word with the emotion) and the scores were complemented with an incomplete random block methodology, to estimate the qualification of the remaining words. Acceptable consistency was found among the judges, as well as adjustment of their scores in the Rasch model, which allowed accepting the obtained results. From these ratings, 9 % of the root words associated with 38 emotions (18 negative, 17 positive, and 3 neutral), subsequently supplemented with their respective endings, were cleared.

The procedure of intentional vocabulary learning involved pre-teaching of lexical items and explicitly informing the students they would have to use the vocabulary in a following productive activity (writing an essay), while the incidental uptake took place in the course of self-study where the students had to watch an authentic audiovisual recording and then write an essay on the subject discussed in the video. The case study employed a quantitative research method to calculate the amount of the target words and collocations used in the written output, and a qualitative method to assess the accuracy of their usage. Two months later a delayed posttest was done to check the students' productive knowledge of the target lexis form. The experiment correlated with output- and involvement load hypotheses, and had to assess the effect of a text-based output on learning outcomes, as well as observe how applicable is the involvement load hypothesis to analysing the students' self-study strategies. The study showed that the intentional mode of learning outperformed the incidental acquisition by over 20% and suggested what factors may have enhanced the scope of the ESP vocabulary retention. Further studies could concentrate on evaluating ESP learners' both productive and receptive target vocabulary competence over a longer-term perspective.

As the number exponentially increases, it becomes difficult for the government authorities to redress the grievances timely, efficiently, and effectively. In this paper, the authors are proposing different text mining and sentimental analysis techniques, on the content of the grievance, to prioritize the grievances submitted to the Chief Minister (CM) grievance cell, Odisha Province. Using these techniques, the grievances are prioritized as high priority, medium priority, and low priority. It helps the concerned government authorities to redress the top priority grievances within a stipulated time period, in comparison to medium and low priority grievances. This helps the needy and common citizen to get timely public services and government support, and their faith and confidence increases on the government machinery.

It selected a sample as a source of nonfinancial information containing Annual reports, Sustainable development reports, ESG reports (environmental, social, governance) and Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) reports of public firms listed in the Russian stock market (MOEX) from 2010 to 2018. To evaluate the role of information disclosure there were applied Bloomberg ESG disclosure indexes. The methodology of text analysis was based on latent semantic analysis (LSA) technique. Latent semantic analysis is a method of textual associative patterns recognition and themes of text formalization with rich mathematical background. Besides, we applied classical text mining procedure - bag of words with corporate social performance dictionary. The results demonstrate both significant influence of some themes or information disclosure importance for stakeholders and independent market agents. Firstly, this study serves top-management purposes and expands understanding of non-financial information influence. Second, the results may be used by external agents to detect the core idea vanishing in text massive.	[Fedorova, E. A.] Financial Univ Govt Russian Federat, Moscow, Russia; [Afanasev, D.

The article discusses how the depth of environmental information disclosure in Russian companies' reports estimated using the authors' dictionary (taxonomy) affects their investment attractiveness. Methodologically, the study rests on the concepts of green economy, behavioral finance and corporate social responsibility. The main research methods are textual and cluster analysis. Annual reports of 60 Russian listed companies for 10 years constitute the empirical base of the present work. The authors divide the period under examination (2015-2018) into two clusters. The first one is comprised companies with a high level of environmental information disclosure and relatively low investment attractiveness; the second cluster embraces companies with a low level of information disclosure, but high investment attractiveness. Despite the fact that the composition of the first cluster changes every year, it inalterably includes organizations engaged in chemical, metallurgical, energy and mining sectors. In each cluster, there is a constant increase in the level of environmental information disclosure, which may be caused by the tightening of legal requirements. However, no statistically significant relationship between the level of environmental information disclosure and the investment attractiveness of a company was found, which might be due to the absence of significant changes in investment attractiveness of companies in each cluster over time.

Few initiatives have been launched to achieve this goal and for this reason we will create a resource that will give the deaf community to have greater access to textual information of the listener-speaking community. Our goal is to build a tool that translates general texts and also academic content such as encyclopedias into Peruvian sign language which will be represented by a 3D avatar. This translation will feature different lexical-syntactic processing modules as well as the disambiguation of terms using a small lexicon, similar to Wordnet synsets.

Remizov's "Explanatory Dictionary," published under the pseudonym "Vasily Ilmenev" is a review of the first volume of the Explanatory Dictionary of the Russian Language edited by D.N. Ushakov (Moscow, 1935). The attribution and analysis of the "Explanatory Dictionary" have allowed me to qualify it as a work with artistic value that may be thematically and stylistically included in a series of Remizov's prose miniatures in the two volumes of Remizov's book Russia in Letters. As his sources, Remizov used a number of dictionary articles that recorded and explained words that were relevant in the USSR before 1937 ("to brand," "to slander," "denunciation," etc.). The inclusion of the miniature "Explanatory Dictionary" in the writer's legacy better understanding of the writer's attitude to the Stalin regime. It is an unusual work for Remizov as it openly expresses the author's political views.

Political actors are also working to increase their access to the electoral masses and to participate in politics on these platforms as the target groups are included in these channels. Younger generations' use of social media rather than traditional media such as television and newspapers make social networks more important for political actors. Using text mining, it is possible to analyze and make sense of a large amount of data in different formats in these environments. In this study, their leadership characteristics of two political candidates, Binali Yildirim and Ekrem Imamoglu, who were the leaders of the Istanbul Metropolitan 23 June 2019 elections, were determined by examining their discourses on Twitter. The leadership features of the discourse strategy followed by the successful leader and their political supporters were analyzed. The study deployed a descriptive research model (Yildirim & Simsek, 2018, p. 239) and a comparative method. A mixed research design was used which included both qualitative and quantitative methods. At the same time, discourse and emotion analyzes were conducted using text mining methods on the tweets of both candidates. The result of the "assertiveness-sensitivity measurement" indicated that Binali Yildirim demonstrated "success-oriented leadership" features, and Ekrem Imamoglu demonstrated "supportive leadership" features. The result of the "assertiveness-sensitivity measurement" made based on the leaders' Twitter feed indicated that Ekrem Imamoglu was both more assertive and sensitive than Binali Yildirim.

EVERYONE HAS THEIR OWN SIBERIA: INTERVIEW WITH OLEG MANDZHIEV	SIBERIAN HISTORICAL RESEARCH-SIBIRSKIE ISTORICHESKIE ISSLEDOVANIYA			Russian	Article						deportation; Kalmyks; oral story; narrative; repressions; identity; Siberia; politics of memory		The article deals with an understudied issue, that of the daily life of Kalmyks deported to Siberia (1943-1956), and includes an introduction, an interview with the famous Kalmyk writer and screenwriter Oleg Mandzhiev, and an analysis of the discursive strategies he uses in his narrative. The text constructs an autobiographical story more than half a century after the actual events, making the daily life of Mandzhiev's family all the more interesting and important, particularly given that the narrator's father had received the title of 'Hero of the Soviet Union' and his view of the twentieth-century military history is of special value. In an unplanned biographical interview focused on the years of the deportation of Kalmyks, important aspects are not only the mentioned facts and the growing boy's feelings and thoughts, but also the narrative forms, such as plot, images, judgements, lexical composition, and grammatical structures. Oleg Mandzhiev belongs to the generation of Kalmyk children born in Siberia after World War II. In the interview, he talks about his childhood in Novosibirsk, highlighting topics such as practices of exclusion in school, personal resistance strategies, experiencing stigmatized ethnicity, and accepting Kalmykia as an attributed homeland. Particular attention is paid to the language of trauma, through which traumatic memory manifests itself in a spontaneous narrative: these are stories about feces, festering wounds, and diseases, with parallels drawn with deprived, historical social groups. The article will be of interest to all researchers of the Kalmyk deportation, to historians of the region and urbanists alike.

It is one of the cores and well-researched areas in NLP. However, for low-resource languages, like Bangla, one of the prominent challenge is the lack of resources. Another important limitation, in the current literature for Bangla, is the absence of comparable results due to the lack of a well-defined train/test split. In this study, we explore several publicly available sentiment labeled datasets and designed classifiers using both classical and deep learning algorithms. In our study, the classical algorithms include SVM and Random Forest, and deep learning algorithms include CNN, FastText, and transformer-based models. We compare these models in terms of model performance and time-resource complexity. Our finding suggests transformer-based models, which have not been explored earlier for Bangla, outperform all other models. Furthermore, we created a weighted list of lexicon content based on the valence score per class. We then analyzed the content for high significance entries per class, in the datasets. For reproducibility, we make publicly available data splits and the ranked lexicon list. The presented results can be used for future studies as a benchmark.

The concept of gender is considered as a conventional social construct, comprising the ideas about culturally conditioned model of masculinity or femininity, which are currently accepted by Russian society. The corpus of more than 1 000 written texts of mainly political discourse, written by people with different gender affiliations, serves as the material that enables to justify the possibility of application quantitative analysis method, based on frequency characteristics of semantically independent words, belonging to lexical-and-grammatical classes of words: pronouns, particles, prepositions, conjunctions and parenthesis. The method under consideration is aimed at identification and analyzing unevident implied signs, which can't be revealed whilst superficial analysis. Frequent, persistent occurrence of these signs in the texts of political discourse enables to regard them as highly informative quantitative characteristics of written speech of the authors belonging to different gender groups. It is stated, the results of application the quantitative model of author's gender identification, represented in the paper, are more reliable if they are used in combination with traditional linguistic model, which presupposes the analysis of linguistic, speech, textual, semantic, psycholinguistic and social characteristics of texts. The article outlines the prospects of speech diagnostics of a person on the basis of gender for the development of author's forensic examination.

Even though the traditional literary norm is being destroyed, these linguistic innovations fulfil a language compensatory function. Internet communication and the new speech processes found in it provoke a keen research interest and are extensively explored by linguists. Major global changes in our life (cloud-based technologies, ecology, post-truth, the problem of generations, Big Data, etc.) were bound to transform communication itself. Therefore, we see changes in genres, functional styles, texts and our traditional ideas of various forms of the Russian national language usage. The Russian Internet (Runet) reveals language potential, fulfils the compensatory function of the language filling in all the elements missing so far and language shortcomings (neologisms denoting feminine gender-specific job titles, deviant verbal forms, new structures in comparative forms of adverbs and adjectives, etc.). The speech system of the Internet communication should be considered not as a double-sided one (oral and written) but as a conceptually new digital form of language use. In the democratic environment of pluralism, tolerance and the freedom of language use, lexical and lexical-grammatical innovations, "the new vernacular", irregular grammar and lexical collocability, as well as the direct and conscious intention to break the norm of the literary language, should be justified and deemed a manifestation of the compensatory language function. Special attention is given to the acute problem of fundamental transformations in teaching practice. (C) 2020 Published by European Publisher.

It considers new visual imaginings of city and urbanity in view of three issues that resonate with the history of early modern Istanbul: modalities and the lexicon of vision as they took shape parallel to changing spatial practices; the making of a new urban public, and polyphonic forms of representation concomitant to the emergence of new publicities; the conflicted political environment that turned the city's public spaces into arenas of contestation in the later decades of the 1500s. To this end, the article focuses on narrative paintings and texts of a set of manuscripts created between the late 1580s and the turn of the seventeenth century, and with particular attention to the Surname-i Humayun (Book of Festivities, 1588), explores the notions and connections that shaped them.

Information pollution has become a serious threat to the online digital world and has posed several challenges to social media platforms and governments around the world. In this article, we propose Propaganda Spotting in Online Urdu Language (ProSOUL) - a framework to identify content and sources of propaganda spread in the Urdu language. First, we develop a labelled dataset of 11,574 Urdu news to train the machine learning classifiers. Next, we develop the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) dictionary to extract psycho-linguistic features of Urdu text. We evaluate the performance of different classifiers by varying n-gram, News Landscape (NELA), Word2Vec, and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) features. Our results show that the combination of NELA, word n-gram, and character n-gram features outperform with 0.91 accuracy for Urdu text classification. In addition, Word2Vec embedding outperforms BERT features in classification of the Urdu text with 0.87 accuracy. Moreover, we develop and classify large scale Urdu content repositories to identify web sources spreading propaganda. Our results show that ProSOUL framework performs best for propaganda detection in the online Urdu news content compared to the general web content. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study on the detection of propaganda content in the Urdu language.

J	LeRoy, A				LeRoy, Alyssa			THE CHEESE STANDS ALONE: WISCONSIN'S "QUIRKY" PARTIAL VETO IN ITS NEW CONSTITUTIONAL ERA	WISCONSIN LAW REVIEW			English	Editorial Material								Wisconsin occupies a unique position on the national stage as having one of the most powerful and expansive partial veto powers of any state. While the governors of most states use a pen to veto budget bills, the Wisconsin Governor holds a "pair of scissors," allowing him to slash legislative enactments and piece together new law, subject only to the rarely successful two-thirds veto override. While constitutional amendments in 1990 and 2008 have constrained this power to prohibit the striking and stringing together of individual letters within words and the creating of a new sentence by combining parts of two or more words across sentences, the Governor can still create policies never intended by the Legislature through a creative cobbling together of words within a sentence. In 1930, Wisconsin amended its constitution to create the partial veto, which allows the Governor to veto appropriation bills "in whole or in part." In 1935, the Wisconsin Supreme Court first interpreted "part" using its broad dictionary definition, with no qualifications; the result is that the parts remaining after a partial veto must be a "complete, entire, and workable law." After decades of ensuing court decisions expanding the partial veto, failed amendments, and partisan battles over the partial veto, the Legislature passed in 1990 and again in 2008 constitutional amendments constraining the power. Though 2020 was poised to see an overhaul in the partial veto jurisprudence, the court's decision in Bartlett v. Evers and Wisconsin Small Businesses United, Inc. v. Brennan seemingly left the core of the partial veto power intact-but without the support of a majority rationale. This Comment first argues that the court's initial interpretation of "part" in 1935 ignored the textual and extrinsic clues indicating that the Legislature intended not to create a unique and broad gubernatorial tool, but instead intended to create an item veto (a common tool to strike individual appropriations), bringing Wisconsin in line with the thirty-seven other states that, at the time, had an item veto. This Comment then suggests, however, that in structuring the 1990 and 2008 amendments to prohibit specific partial veto practices, the Legislature enshrined into the constitution the court's broad and erroneous definition of "part" as interpreted in 1935, precluding any future judicial return to the 1930 amendment's original intended meaning. Consequently, though these modern amendments-and even Bartlett-provide some constraints on the partial veto, a return to the originally intended item veto must come through another constitutional amendment; until then, Wisconsin stands alone as the unique and "quirky" partial veto state.

In this review, given the proliferation of papers now using this method, we first provide an updated survey of the literature while focusing on a few broad topics-social media, political bias, and detecting fraud. We do not attempt to survey the various statistical methods and instead initially focus on the construction and use of lexicons in finance. We then center the discussion on readability as an attribute frequently incorporated in contemporaneous research, arguing that its use begs the question of what we are measuring. Finally, we discuss how the literature might build on the intent of measuring readability to measure something more appropriate and more broadly relevant-complexity.

This provides a rich source of information at a number of levels that can be useful both commercially and at government level. Analyzing media in English, which uses sentiment lexicons, is well established. Posts written in Arabic is a challenging task primarily due to Arabic's rich morphology. There have been a number of efforts to build Arabic sentiment lexicons. However, they suffer from being of a limited size, unclear usability plan or publicly not available.

Students of not only philological faculties, but also students of non-linguistic faculties try to master the profession of translator. That is why, basing on the needs of society, in the educational programs of many universities, the program of additional education "Translator in the field of professional communication" was introduced. This program is successful and in demand. Currently, teaching a foreign language unites all types of speech activity and translation is considered as one of the types of such activity. The main goal of the translation course is the formation of translation competence based on basic language and cultural knowledge. Teaching translation at the present stage requires the use of the concepts of traditional translation, the results of the analysis of translation practice, modern research in these areas, new approaches to solving methodological problems/tasks of teaching translation. The translation training program is aimed at creating translation competence in the field of professional communication, systematizing theoretical knowledge about the structure of texts of various genres, teaching students linguistic analysis of texts, the ability to conduct a comparative analysis of source and target texts in terms of translation, and expanding linguistic and cultural knowledge. For the successful implementation of the task of training specialists in the field of professional translation, it is necessary to improve the organization of the educational process, apply various teaching methods, various forms of monitoring the formation of translation skills. As a material for the translation, texts of various genres were selected, in particular, socio-political, special, and artistic. The translation exercises offered by the authors of this article help students to learn how to determine the genre of the text, identify the type of information, lexical and stylistic means of its implementation, reflect the characteristic linguistic and genre features of the translation of each type of text. It is necessary to teach students to analyze the source texts and create their own, translating not individual words, but the meaning. To achieve this goal, students should be able to conduct pre-translation text analysis, find the most suitable translation option, and analyze the translation result. When teaching translation of different types of texts, a competency-based approach was used, understood as a combination of training and control methods aimed at the formation of the basic skills of professional translators.

J	Nefedov, ST				Nefedov, Sergey Trofimovich			The word, sentence, text and discourse semantics of the lexeme Kontext 'context'	SPRACHE & SPRACHEN			German	Article						collocations with Kontext; the lexeme Kontext; the term Kontext; text and discourse theme indicators; word semantics		This paper deals with the typical use of the lexeme Kontext 'context' in different linguistic settings of the German language. Previous diachronic studies of this lexeme are discussed and a systematic analysis of its typical uses in linguistics and pragmatics is provided. Diachronically the lexical meaning of the word Kontext shows a semantic enrichment (based on metaphorization) and a splitting of its original meaning, i.e. the dominant tendency to refer to the linguistic environment, rather than the inherent characteristics of the objects involved. On the textual level the corpus-based collocation analysis and the accompanying context analysis reveal a close semantic connection of the Kontext-tokens to the topical and significant components of the text, which indicate a text theme on the principle of pars pro toto. As a consequence, the linkage between a text theme and a discourse type makes it possible to establish the typical usage of the lexeme Kontext within the six institutional discourse practices: culture, politics, public events, leisure activities, science, and economy.

GENDER ASPECT OF THE LINGUISTIC PERSONALITY OF A POLITICIAN OF THE 18TH CENTURY (ON THE BASE OF THE TEXT OF THE RUSSIAN EMPRESS CATHERINE THE GREAT)	7TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON EDUCATION AND SOCIAL SCIENCES (INTCESS 2020)			English	Proceedings Paper	7th International Conference on Education and Social Sciences (INTCESS)	JAN 20-22, 2020	Dubai, U ARAB EMIRATES			linguistic personality; gender linguistics; linguistic picture of the world; lexical and semantic group		The article is devoted to the analysis of the gender specificity of the language personality of Catherine the Second through the study of the lexical and grammatical features of her texts. The novelty of the study consists in studying the linguistic personality of a politician in a diachronic aspect and in describing the features of the linguistic personality of Catherine II through the prism of her gender specificity. The reconstruction of the main personality features of Catherine II through comprehensive, multilevel analysis of language tools allows us to identify the psychological, pragmatic, cognitive, gender aspects of the speech behavior of the Russian Empress, the specifics of her linguistic picture of the world due to bio-sociopsychological personality data and ideological and thematic originality of her works of various genres. A study of the texts of Catherine the Second showed that the empress depicts her feelings, feelings, emotions figuratively, trying to emphasize and artistically highlight the meaning of a word depending on her communicative situation. It was proved that the empress's gender also determines the fact that in the works of Catherine II of any genre a large number of lexical and semantic groups of words (nouns, adjectives, verbs) of feelings, perception and mental state are represented. One of the main signs of the author's gender affiliation is the usage of a large number of metaphors, epithets, vivid comparisons and personifications, etc. The study revealed that the most important trend in female speech behavior is "increased emotionality and the desire to evaluate the activities of others".

J	Pietrzak, E				Pietrzak, Edyta			Feminist political science. About two sisters: Critique and Theory	AVANT			Polish	Article						feminism; political science; feminist theory; political theory; feminist critique		Before we consider how feminist theories changed political science, how they influenced its epistemology and methodology, and whether they contributed to significant cognitive turns within its framework, we first have to observe that, although feminism is thoroughly political and refers to the relationship between gender and power, it was created as an ideology of a social movement, and therefore outside the academy. The adoption of feminist theories by political science has never been as mutually satisfactory as in the case of sociology or history. Rather, it has been a history of a difficult relationship, a history of two paradigms or two sisters. The elder, Critique, is a pattern-defying activist of changing moods and views; the younger, Theory, is distanced and likes to weigh words but also follows the voice of her heart, albeit less often. Feminist political science must constantly refer to feminist thought and criticism in its broadest sense and adapt its research programme accordingly. Feminist criticism, however, shows little approval of or interest in feminist political science, regarding it as insufficiently bold and so far unable to reach sufficiently radical conclusions in its analysis of politics. On the other hand, feminist political science, drawing on feminist criticism, is also not entirely attractive to the traditional, "hard" mainstream of political science which does not fully understand its interdisciplinarity, crossing methodological boundaries and using various dictionaries. Such features are perceived as a threat to the identity of a scientific discipline that refers to specialist knowledge, placing feminist political science on the margins. The article discusses the pros and cons of this difficult relationship. Since it focuses on theories, the approach will be a epistemological and methodological. The text consists of three parts: an introduction to feminist politics, a presentation of feminist perspectives in political science, and the arguments supporting the hypothesis that Theory (feminist political science) is two steps behind Critique (activists, radical feminists).

The terms studied have appeared in English over the past seven years as a result of events occurring in the political and economic spheres of the life of the European community. These events were the extra-linguistic factors that caused the emergence of new terms. The study is conducted on the basis of methods of continuous viewing of authentic English texts of newspapers and magazines of economic and political orientation. In the inventory process, the collected and description of the abbreviated terms, their lexicographic processing and description are collected. To identify the structural model of the studied terms, their structural analysis was carried out and productive models for constructing abbreviated political and economic English terms were determined. The patterns in the formation of the described terms and terminological combinations are identified, systematized and grouped, examples of the variation and uniqueness of the terms are given. It reveals a direct link between the events taking place in society, the emergence of new concepts and the origin of new English words, terms and terminological combinations necessary for their naming. The work on inventory and unification of the described terms and terminological combinations was carried out.	[Prosvirnina, L. G.; Ezhgurova, A.

It is aimed at the revealing semantic-cognitive peculiarities of language means that verbalize concept's notional, evaluative and imagery-associative content. The purpose of the article is to expose heuristic potential and practical efficiency of corpus and concordance technologies application in conceptual studies. The analysis of the discussed concept was performed on the basis of created textual corpus that includes 412 texts. In the research we apply concordance technology for the creation of concept's nominative field by analyzing the lexical means of direct and indirect concept nominations, their coreferents and associates frequency and distribution. To create the evaluative level of the concept the attention was paid to the frequency and distribution of lexemes with evaluative and emotional meaning. To analyze the conceptual metaphor as a basis of concept's image content modeling the corpus was metaphorically annotated. The corpus based analysis of the frequency and distribution of the concept verbalizers, the analysis of lexical semantics and pragmatics, the consideration of contextual content of concept actualization allowed to develop the frame model of the concept in both discourses and define common cognitive features of the concept Ukraine in the discussed linguistic cultures.

The Contribution of Sorin Stati: From Word to Trans-phrase	ROMANIA IN SPATIUL EUROATLANTIC: INTERFERENTE CULTURALE SI LINGVISTICE			Unspecified	Proceedings Paper	International Annual Symposium of the Institute-of-Romanian-Philology - A Philippide - Iasi-Branch of the Romanian-Academy	SEP 18-20, 2019	Iasi, ROMANIA	Inst Romanian Philol, Romanian Acad, Iasi Branch		trans-phrase; syntax; phrastic content; trans-syntax; infra-syntax		Sorin Stati was a Romanian brilliant mind, clear, intuitive and innovative, a prodigious linguist as Eugen Coseriu was. After Sorin Stati's departure abroad in 1972, his contribution on the development of the general linguistics didn't have the same notoriety as among his native peers. His papers in the field of linguistics were original by the clarity of ideas, the depth of the analysis and the correct interpretative suggestions, so that no Romanian linguistic paper published in Romania couldn't omit from discussions the contributions of Sorin Stati. This remark is valid only for the period up to 1972. As we have shown, the papers from the period after 1972 were no longer accepted at the level of Romanian linguistics for political reasons. Being passionate about the movement of the avant-garde theoretical ideas, Sorin Stati permanently extended his area of interests in new fields such as pragmatics, syntactic semantics, trans-phrastics, textual lexicology et al. Nonetheless, the purpose of this article is to establish a parallel between the two hypostases (international and national) of the linguist's activity from the perspective of his papers, with an emphasis on those less known in his own country. We will consider some innovative linguistic ideas in the context of general linguistic evolution, and we will distinguish and analyze his most important ideas in the area of infra-syntax and trans-syntax (our terminology, M.S.). The analysis of the concepts has been reformulated by the syntagma found in the title of this article: "from word to trans-phrase". Our assessment is not polemical, but assertive, presentative, receptive and captivating. Regarding the word as a syntactic unit, we notice that S. Stati is the first and only linguist who manages to give a three-pronged syntactic description of it, consisting of functional content, categorical content and denotative content, a description that discusses the conjugated criteria of form and syntactic content. This approach brilliantly solves the syncopes of linguistic logic regarding the theories of classical and neo-traditional syntactic units that lacked a categorical theoretical perspective, based on formal and functional oppositions. Regarding the transphrase, Sorin Stati describes it firstly as a cross-border unit, as a unit of transphrase, which is no longer related to syntax and is not an extension of the notion of phrase or syntax. But the difficulty of fully founding a new field of research, the one of transphrasing, without the permanent appeal to syntax, will make S. Stati finally nuance his perception and accept the mixture of fields.

J	Serra, S				Serra, Sophie			Some reflections on the material and linguistic conditions of the universal monarchy according to Nicole Oresme	PHILOSOPHICAL READINGS			French	Article						universal monarchy; language; fiction / reality; political community; comunication; conversation; translation		During the 1370s, Nicole Oresme (1320-1382) completed for king Charles the 5th the translation of three of Aristotle's books (le Livre de Politiques, Livre de Ethiques et Livre de Yconomiques) which belong to the field of "mundane sciences" as he described it. This translation project manifests at the same time Oresme's own involvement in these texts (as he punctuates Aristotle's writings with many glosses about 14th century political debates about franciscan poverty, succession, etc), and his willingness to devise a new and accurate French lexicon for political theories. This paper focuses on one of the longest glosses of the Livre de Politiques, dedicated to the discussion of universal monarchy that particularly emphasises Oresme's conception of a fact-based political theory - relying on historical, anthropological and linguistic backgrounds - and as the double meaning of the word "communication" (as "speech" as well as "togetherness ").

The results of the analysis of Kazakhstani media with verbally expressed manipulative discursive practice are presented. The research material was the Russian-language texts of opposition newspapers and information and analytical portals of the Republic of Kazakhstan. The choice of the source of factual material is due to the fact that it is in such a mass media discourse that language markers of the manipulability of the text are most pronounced. Given the generalization of the results of modern research, the concept of the manipulative nature of mass media discourse is defined. As a result of the analysis of texts from the position of cognitive-discursive and linguistic approaches, the main lexical, morphological and syntactic markers of manipulativeness are identified. For the first time, syntactic tools are described and formalized in which predicates in collocation with lexical and morphological tools form lexical and grammatical markers - statistically valid indicators of computer diagnostics of manipulativeness as a factor of a certain information threat to society. The results of the study can be theoretically and practically significant in the fields of sociology, political science, pragmatic linguistics, journalism, and information technology.

In recent years language models pre-trained on large corpora emerged as clear winners in numerous NLP tasks, but no proper analysis of the corpora which led to their success has been conducted. The paper presents a procedure for robust frequency estimation, which helps in establishing the core lexicon for a given corpus, as well as a procedure for estimating the corpus composition via unsupervised topic models and via supervised genre classification of Web pages. The results of the digital curation study applied to several Web-derived corpora demonstrate their considerable differences. First, this concerns different frequency bursts which impact the core lexicon obtained from each corpus. Second, this concerns the kinds of texts they contain. For example, OpenWebText contains considerably more topical news and political argumentation in comparison to ukWac or Wikipedia. The tools and the results of analysis have been released.

INFORMATION DOCUMENTS OF EXECUTIVES: PROBLEMS OF IDENTIFICATION AND DESCRIPTION	VESTNIK VOLGOGRADSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA-SERIYA 2-YAZYKOZNANIE			Russian	Article						discourse; written discourse of executive authorities; document; informative documents; genre; public report; press release; briefing materials		The article considers the system of information documents of the executives. It is shown that genre forms used in public administration for the purpose of informing are numerous. Many of these forms lack clear genre nominations, which explains the fact that researchers substitute genre nominations by names of the issues in which the informative documents are published. The author characterizes the information genres, which are in major demand with state administration: public report, press release and briefing materials. The article reveals that public report reflects information about the officials' actions or about the actual state of affairs with the relevant government agency; by its structure, it is a standardized text with language units typical of business communication. Press release is a short message about productive work of the authorities, aimed at shaping their positive image; its distinguishing feature is the use of emotionally and expressively colored lexical units and stylistic expressive means. The genre of briefing materials, along with the key objective - to inform, employs an additional setting for popularization of legal information, and hence a wide range of visual tools (tables, charts, flowcharts, fonts, colours, etc.). The author assumes that the contents and the instructive appeal of certain fragments of information genres make them close to the enacting documents genres, although their means of expressing style features are different.

Populist linguistic tone in recent U.S. presidential campaign discourse: a DICTION analysis	COMMUNICATION RESEARCH REPORTS			English	Article						computational text analysis; political communication; populism; tone	POLITICS	This study analyzed the tone of public campaign remarks of right- and left-wing populist (Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders, respectively) and right and left-wing non-populist (Mitt Romney and Hillary Clinton, respectively) U.S. presidential candidates using DICTION 7.0. Findings suggest that populists tended to use a linguistic tone that is high in pessimism, group abstractness, and exclusion. Pessimism and group abstractness were positively associated with immigration language in right-wing populist speech. Commonality and "we-ness" were positively associated with populist language in left-wing populist speech.

In addition to providing a source of data for analysis, this discourse has also led to a rethinking of multifarious research methods. This section presents a series of articles by scholars from different parts of the world with macro- and micro-linguistic perspectives, ranging from corpus-based analysis to content analysis studies. At the macro level, these scholars explored ways through which government bodies communicate with the public. Official announcements, parliamentary proceedings and COVID-19-related corpora are examined and a comparative textual analysis between the Malaysian and British governments is provided. At the micro level, the scholars analysed selected corpora with lexical, semantic, and discourse foci and personal posts of short narratives and photos to encapsulate meanings from human life and experience. The main takeaway from these studies is the application of a wide range of methods for different focus and perspectives that may be customised to the researcher's unique context.

Rereading Bayle	VESTNIK SANKT-PETERBURGSKOGO UNIVERSITETA-ISTORIYA			English	Article						intellectual history; history of science; Bayle; Jurieu; Enlightenment; Republic of Letters; philosophy	IDENTITY PROCESSES; TERMINOLOGY; DISCOURSES; CONTEXT	In the first decades of the twenty-first century there has been a notable surge of scholarly interest in the problems of intellectual history, the issues of the Scientific Revolution in both Natural sciences and Humanities which still stay ahead of the curve. Such renowned researchers as P. Dear, S. Shapin, D. Wootton, and others are contributing to the study of changes in the minds of European intellectuals including their methods and their philosophical comprehension of the world. The monograph by Mara van der Lugt dedicated to the works of an eminent philosopher and writer of the early Enlightenment Pierre Bayle (1647-1706) is a major contribution to the vast Baylean studies which amount to hundreds of papers. The heritage of Bayle is put into political, religious, intellectual, and methodological contexts, including the complicated system of links and relations within the European Republic of Letters. The researcher suggests "a new way of reading Bayle", which enables to raise and analyze a wide range of problems relating to Bayle's "Historical and Critical Dictionary". Another interesting methodological approach is the use of the figure of Bayle's friend-antagonist Pierre Jurieu (1637-1713) as a sort of a semantic pivot, which simplifies the process of structuring and analyzing the enormous textual material. But, however solid and grounded the monograph is, it requires a number of critical comments given in the present review.	[Terenteva, E.

Nevertheless, some types of intralingual translation remain largely undiscovered, such as the process of abridgement in the production of simplified versions of classic literary works (i.e. graded readers). This article subjects three chapters of the abridged version of And Then There Were None by Agatha Christie to qualitative analysis using Descriptive Translation Studies theory. The aim is to contribute to bridging a research gap in Translation Studies by examining the norms and laws governing the process of abridgement. Translation norms and laws are detected by situating the source and the target texts in their respective socio-cultural backgrounds and by analysing translation shifts. Relevant shifts are identified by means of a check-list of features elaborated on the basis of theory on graded readers, which classifies them into lexical, structural and information shifts. The results of the analysis showcase the vast research potential of intralingual translation for language learning purposes.

J	Turksoy, N				Turksoy, Nilufer			"Roy's Turkish Delight": Football, Nationalism and the Representation of Turkey in the British Sports Media	JOURNALISM PRACTICE			English	Article						Representation of the Other; journalism; national identity; stereotyping; England and Turkey; British sports media; football		A large body of literature in representational studies reflects a deep professional concern over the negative effect of the role of the media in representing significant Others. Western media's coverage of an international event, in this case, a football competition, raises some ethical questions about the choice of specific lexical items and textual contents. Drawing on the work of Stuart Hall's representation theory, this article examines how Turkey, a nation located on the semi-periphery of Europe, is represented in Western media outlets. By looking at the role that sections of the British sports press plays in their construction of the Turkish national identity, I evaluate the Euro 2016 and Euro 2004 reporting of the UEFA European Championship qualifying matches between Turkey and England. I apply a combination of lexical and narrative analysis, and I question the way that Turkey is represented in the British sport texts. The style and language used in the presentation of football games reveals that British media outlets are prone to present England's politically and economically powerful position, and its cultural superiority over Turkey. Findings also suggest that the discourse of the "West and the Rest" is alive in the modern world.

Using the methods of semantic and contextual analysis, a complex of preferred linguistic means has been identified that characterize the main distinctive features of a female linguistic personality in media discourse both in Russian and German. The presented research results are based on the analysis of publications - both printed and electronic - in Russian and German languages. The analyzed texts were written by women and are a part of women's media texts. The texts were taken from various sources including analytical, political, economic and business magazines and newspapers, periodicals, women's magazines published primarily for a readership of women, etc. It has been established that the verbal-semantic level of the female linguistic personality in media discourse is realized by lexical-grammatical means, lexical combinations, formula phrases, i.e. is a gender-specific lexicon of a female personality. The significance for the theory of language is proved by the fact that the study of the verbal-semantic level of the female linguistic personality seems to be relevant for establishing the referential laws of the verbalization of the female linguistic picture of the world in media discourse.

For legislative Chinese, as a kind of Chinese for specific purposes, the comparative study of its keywords with those of general Chinese is of great significance for understanding its linguistic features. This study uses the legislative Chinese corpus and Chinese Web 2011 corpus mutually as the observation corpus and the reference corpus, and extracts 50 keywords with the highest keyness score respectively from each corpus. Through a comparative analysis of the semantic classification of these keywords, this study finds that legislative Chinese has the characteristics of focusing on political and economic meanings, showing strong professionalism, having more numerals and monosemous words. This study is of great significance for exploring the characteristics of legislative Chinese vocabulary and exploring the textual features of legislative Chinese.

Studying the past teaches the present not to repeat its mistakes in the future. The article gives an insight into the most frequent linguistic features and systematizes the dominants and specific characteristics of W. Churchill's speeches within the axial model. The material of the study is two well-known speeches delivered by Winston Churchill in 1940 and 1949. The main research method is semantic, cognitive and rhetorical analysis of the text. The article explores the content of the "war" concept, which is considered on the basis of the "field model" and English-English dictionaries definitions, as well as describes its core and periphery. The detailed analysis shows that W. Churchill made an active use of rhetoric tropes and figures of speech, especially metaphors. W. Churchill clearly demonstrated the features of an elitist language personality as, along with being proficient in codified language, ethical, communicative- pragmatic and rhetorical norms of a standard language, he skillfully and creatively used the devices of functional styles, speech genres, and special techniques of oral and written forms of speech.

J	Zunic, A; Corcoran, P; Spasic, I				Zunic, Anastazia; Corcoran, Padraig; Spasic, Irena			Sentiment Analysis in Health and Well-Being: Systematic Review	JMIR MEDICAL INFORMATICS			English	Review						sentiment analysis; natural language processing; text mining; machine learning	EMOTION DETECTION; SUICIDE NOTES; SOCIAL MEDIA; SEQUENCE MODELS; CLASSIFICATION; TWEETS; CLASSIFIERS; INFORMATION; RESOURCES; DISCOVERY	Background: Sentiment analysis (SA) is a subfield of natural language processing whose aim is to automatically classify the sentiment expressed in a free text. It has found practical applications across a wide range of societal contexts including marketing, economy, and politics. This review focuses specifically on applications related to health, which is defined as "a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity." Objective: This study aimed to establish the state of the art in SA related to health and well-being by conducting a systematic review of the recent literature. To capture the perspective of those individuals whose health and well-being are affected, we focused specifically on spontaneously generated content and not necessarily that of health care professionals. Methods: Our methodology is based on the guidelines for performing systematic reviews. In January 2019, we used PubMed, a multifaceted interface, to perform a literature search against MEDLINE. We identified a total of 86 relevant studies and extracted data about the datasets analyzed, discourse topics, data creators, downstream applications, algorithms used, and their evaluation. Results: The majority of data were collected from social networking and Web-based retailing platforms. The primary purpose of online conversations is to exchange information and provide social support online. These communities tend to form around health conditions with high severity and chronicity rates. Different treatments and services discussed include medications, vaccination, surgery, orthodontic services, individual physicians, and health care services in general. We identified 5 roles with respect to health and well-being among the authors of the types of spontaneously generated narratives considered in this review: a sufferer, an addict, a patient, a carer, and a suicide victim. Out of 86 studies considered, only 4 reported the demographic characteristics. A wide range of methods were used to perform SA. Most common choices included support vector machines, naive Bayesian learning, decision trees, logistic regression, and adaptive boosting. In contrast with general trends in SA research, only 1 study used deep learning. The performance lags behind the state of the art achieved in other domains when measured by F-score, which was found to be below 60% on average. In the context of SA, the domain of health and well-being was found to be resource poor: few domain-specific corpora and lexica are shared publicly for research purposes. Conclusions: SA results in the area of health and well-being lag behind those in other domains. It is yet unclear if this is because of the intrinsic differences between the domains and their respective sublanguages, the size of training datasets, the lack of domain-specific sentiment lexica, or the choice of algorithms.

J	Duan, JW; Ding, X; Zhang, Y; Liu, T				Duan, Junwen; Ding, Xiao; Zhang, Yue; Liu, Ting			TEND: A Target-Dependent Representation Learning Framework for News Document	IEEE-ACM TRANSACTIONS ON AUDIO SPEECH AND LANGUAGE PROCESSING			English	Article						Task analysis; Text mining; Twitter; Speech processing; Logic gates; Internet; Neural networks; Stock Market Prediction; Target-dependent Representation; Document Representation; Stance Detection		Real-time news documents published on the Internet have global financial and political impacts. Pioneering statistical approaches investigate manually defined features to capture lexical, sentiment, and event information, which suffer from feature sparsity. As a remedy, recent work has considered learning dense vector representations for documents. Such representations are general, which can not model target-dependent scenarios, such as stance detection towards a specific claim. There has been work on target-specific word and sentence representations, but little was done on target-dependent document representation. Moreover, documents contain more potentially helpful information, but also noise compared to events and sentences. To address the above issues, we focus on models that are: 1. task-driven, which optimize the neural network representations for the end task; 2. target-specific, learning news representations by considering the influence of specific targets. In particular, we propose a novel document-level target-dependent learning framework TEND. The framework employs the information of the target and the news abstract as clues, obtaining relatively informative sentences from the entire document for our objectives. The framework assembles a document representation by integrating the news abstract representation and a weighted sum of sentence representations in the document. To the best of our knowledge, we are among the first to investigate target-dependent document representation. Existing text representation models can be easily integrated into our TEND framework, and it is general enough to be applied to different target-dependent document representation tasks. We empirically evaluate our framework on two target-dependent document-level tasks, including a cumulative abnormal return prediction task and a news stance detection task. Results show that our models give the best performances compared to state-of-the-art document embedding methods, yielding robust and consistent performances across datasets.

Linguistic and Cultural Analysis of the Treaty between Germany and France	TARIH KULTUR VE SANAT ARASTIRMALARI DERGISI-JOURNAL OF HISTORY CULTURE AND ART RESEARCH			English	Article						Political Linguistics; International Relations; The Franco-German Treaty; Political Discourse; Text Analysis		The study deals with structuring of the analysis of the politically orientated texts in order to identify the main ideological content at the linguistic level and its expression in the text. In the course of the research, the influence of linguistic and spatial-social factors is revealed. The linguistic expression of the content changes depending on the purposes of communication and the social group in which it is currently taking place. The lexical units in these texts are inextricably linked with the associative field of this culture carriers. The analysis of a political text conducted without taking into account these specifics will be incomplete. It can lead to distortion of the original meaning and misunderstanding. The study develops the criteria for linguistic objectification of the text ideological orientation. To confirm the objectivity of the information received the linguistic analysis of the politically orientated texts is carried out. The treaty between Germany and France concluded in 2019 in Aachen is under consideration. Its analysis specifies the implementation sequence of separate stages of the analysis of the political text taking into account its specifics and outlines the content of the politically oriented texts according to the scheme offered by the authors of the research.

STRUCTURAL AND SEMANTIC FEATURES OF COMPLEX WORDS OF POLITICAL LEXICON IN THE GERMAN LANGUAGE	TURISMO-ESTUDOS E PRATICAS			English	Article						linguistics; analysis; word; discourse; semantics		This paper considers structural and semantic features of compound words of the political vocabulary of the German language. Of interest is the activity of compounding as a way of forming German political vocabulary. These phenomena are especially diverse in journalistic articles. It is social and political journalism that has more expressiveness of the conveyed information compared to the official business style. There are different ways of classifying complex words. In this article we analyze complex words from the viewpoint of structure and semantics. Complex words of certain languages have already been exposed to scholarly studies, but too little attention is given to studying political vocabulary since political text as an object of public communication is very rich in complex words. Many complex words are lexicalized in German political vocabulary, which confirms the need for their full and detailed analysis from a structural-semantic viewpoint. This fact determines the topicality of the article. The purpose of this article is to study the structural and semantic features of political vocabulary represented by compounds. The main research methods are the method of continuous sampling, the descriptive, comparative methods and the method of semantic analysis, as well as the method of analysis for the directly constituent components, which made it possible to draw generalized conclusions according to the results of the research.

RUSSIAN STANDARTS OF HIGHER EDUCATION (LINGUISTICS AND TRANSLATION): PROBLEMS OF LINGUISTIC SECURITY FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF LINGUODIDACTICS	YAZYK I KULTURA-LANGUAGE AND CULTURE			Russian	Article						linguistic security; competence; descriptor; speech norm; stylistic defect; logical mistake; didactic contradictoriness		The paper is focused on competences descriptors formulated in Russian Federal standards (of the so called 'third generation') as demands for those who finish Russian universities with a Bachelor's, Specialist's or Master's degree in linguistics, translation and translation study. It is argued that a critical analysis, aimed at identification of different stylistic, logical and didactic flaws in these texts, should be considered an actual demand of the contemporary moment. A complex stylistic, logical and didactic analysis of competences descriptors formulated in Russian federal education standards of higher education (linguistics' - 45.03.02 (bachelor's degree), 2014; 45.04.02 (master's degree), 2016; and `Translation and interpretation studies' - 45.05.01 (specialist's degree), 2017) has been carried out. The authors argue that the demands of linguistic security are essential for evaluating these standards; a description of these demands, specified in accordance with individual characteristics of the texts, are provided. Among the major principals, or demands, of linguistic security the following ones are denoted: a) the conformity of wordings to language, communicative and ethical norms of Russian speech; b) observance of the balance between the traditional and the innovative, particularly, in the sphere of lexical and syntactic means; c) compliance with the major tendencies of the state language politics; d) indefectibility of the academic discourse presented in the texts; e) demonstration of how to interpret the process of learning languages from the didactic point of view. On the basis of observation and comparison the authors demonstrate that the texts of federal standards under analysis are unable to provide complete correspondence of the education process regulated by them to the principles of linguistic security, and that, at some certain points, they themselves violate these principles. There have been distinguished, in descriptors of general and professional competences, as well as in their systems developed for the standards of bachelor's, specialist's and master's degrees, cases of logic and didactic contradictions, and cases of stylistic defects, such as disregard of lexical compatibility, verbal incompleteness and verbal redundancy, logic displacement, and usage of a word without taking its semantics in consideration. The authors argue that the main source of all these flaws should be considered a careless attitude to cultural heritage and tradition, including the national language and achievements of Russian science (first of all, linguistic and linguodidactics) against the background of commitment to innovations and speedy changes.

J	Martins, R; Almeida, JJ; Henriques, P; Novais, P				Martins, Ricardo; Almeida, Jose Joao; Henriques, Pedro; Novais, Paulo			A sentiment analysis approach to increase authorship identification	EXPERT SYSTEMS			English	Article						machine learning; natural language processing; sentiment analysis	LANGUAGE	Writing style is considered the manner in which an author expresses his thoughts, influenced by language characteristics, period, school, or nation. Often, this writing style can identify the author. One of the most famous examples comes from 1914 in Portuguese literature. With Fernando Pessoa and his heteronyms Alberto Caeiro, alvaro de Campos, and Ricardo Reis, who had completely different writing styles, led people to believe that they were different individuals. Currently, the discussion of authorship identification is more relevant because of the considerable amount of widespread fake news in social media, in which it is hard to identify who authored a text and even a simple quote can impact the public image of an author, especially if these texts or quotes are from politicians. This paper presents a process to analyse the emotion contained in social media messages such as Facebook to identify the author's emotional profile and use it to improve the ability to predict the author of the message. Using preprocessing techniques, lexicon-based approaches, and machine learning, we achieved an authorship identification improvement of approximately 5% in the whole dataset and more than 50% in specific authors when considering the emotional profile on the writing style, thus increasing the ability to identify the author of a text by considering only the author's emotional profile, previously detected from prior texts.

J	Ritchie, D				Ritchie, David			Reclaiming a unified American narrative Lexical, grammatical, and story metaphors in a discussion of polarized identities	METAPHOR AND THE SOCIAL WORLD			English	Article						metaphor; narrative; American national identity; cultural polarization; Trumpism		As part of an on-going project to apply metaphor analysis to understanding the cultural polarization that has recently obstructed discourse about political and cultural issues in both the United States and Europe, this essay examines the lexical, grammatical, and story metaphors in a recent editorial column, by conservative columnist Ross Douthat, that also focuses on this topic. In a key section of the essay, Douthat uses a blend of complex grammatical and lexical metaphors to highlight the contrast between the traditional American identity narrative of settlement and conquest and a recently emerged liberal counter-narrative, which Douthat epitomizes by quoting former President Obama's repeated insistence that "That's not who we are." Douthat's argument is contextualized by the reproduction of an image with the title "Engraving of a massacre of Indian women and children in Idaho by 19th century white settlers," which strengthens the contrasts and implied ironies embedded in his complex combination of grammatical and lexical metaphors. These relationships are brought into sharp focus through the metaphor-led analysis of the text and its interaction with the image, demonstrating the value of this approach to discourse analysis.

J	Syrotinski, M				Syrotinski, Michael			Postcolonial untranslatability: Reading Achille Mbembe with Barbara Cassin	JOURNAL OF POSTCOLONIAL WRITING			English	Article						Untranslatable; multilingual; decolonization; globalization; negre; world		Barbara Cassin's monumental Dictionary of Untranslatables, first published in French in 2004, is an encyclopaedic dictionary of nearly 400 philosophical, literary, aesthetic and political terms which have had a long-lasting impact on thinking across the humanities. Translation is central to any consideration of diasporic linguistic border crossing, and the "Untranslatable" (those words or terms which locate problems of translatability at the heart of contemporary critical theory) has opened up new approaches to philosophically informed translation studies. This article argues that there is a far-reaching resonance between Barbara Cassin's Dictionary of Untranslatables project and Achille Mbembe's theorization of the postcolonial, precisely insofar as they meet at the crossroads of (un)translatability. Both texts are read performatively, in terms of their respective writing practices and theoretical "entanglements", one of Mbembe's key terms.

J	Hopkins, JAF				Hopkins, John Arnold Falcon			From shipwreck to constellation: Rethinking Meillassoux on Mallarme from a semiotic perspective	SEMIOTICA			English	Article						Meillassoux on Mallarme; semiotics vs. numerology; modern poetry		This essay assesses Quentin Meillassoux's numerological approach to Mallarme's problematic but formally innovative poem "Un Coup de des," using a semiotic methodology to reveal the deficiencies of that approach from the viewpoint of literary theory. Section 1 describes my expanded version of Michael Riffaterre's semiotic theory of the structure of modern poetry. Poems are generated by two underlying propositions, each of which governs the structure of a set of symbolic images on the textual surface. These "matricial" propositions are linked by a syntagmatic relation. The primary text functions as subject-sign of the Peircean semiotic triad; its object-sign is an intertextual model. The interpretant of these two textual signs is assembled by the reader and has a sociolectic counterpart - or context - which has similar lexical content but contrasting internal structure. This contrast may produce a change in the preconceptions of the reader. Section 2 examines Meillassoux's approach to Mallarme's poem, which is preoccupied with a "number" supposedly encrypted in the text. This is not convincingly related to the propositional structure of the poem. In Section 3, the text is interpreted using a semiotics-based methodology. The poem is generated by two matrices: one concerning the "Master" versus the storm, and the second concerning the power of Chance. The relation linking the matrices is clarified. This analysis is compared with that of Meillassoux throughout. Section 4 resumes the differences between Meillassoux's concentration on the "number" and the "siren," and my analysis which centres on the relation between the Master (symbolising traditional poets and their preferred metre) and the Constellation (symbolising the wide range of new future poetic metres and formats). Meillassoux's approach turns out to be unconvincing.

J	Lurson, B				Lurson, Benoit			Politics and Rhetoric at the End of the Eighteenth Dynasty	ZEITSCHRIFT FUR AGYPTISCHE SPRACHE UND ALTERTUMSKUNDE			English	Article						Akhmim; Ay; Epideictic genre; Eulogy; Nakhtmin; Political programme; Prophecy of Neferti; Rhetoric; Royal inscription; Royal ideology; Speos of el-Salamuni		During his reign, King Ay had a speos built in Akhmim, known as the speos of el-Salamuni. Its facade displays a monumental inscription, which contains a long eulogy to the king uttered by the overseer of works, Nakhtmin. For the composition of this inscription, its author had recourse to the Prophecy of Neferti. This paper investigates the ways and means of this recourse. First, el-Salamuni's inscription is transliterated, deconstructed, and translated. Then, locutions and verb forms belonging to the first part of the inscription and of the Prophecy of Neferti are compared. This comparison shows that whilst conceiving a unique text, the author of the inscription used locutions and verb forms specific to the Prophecy to compose a text structured like it, thereby allowing the reader to readily call the Prophecy to the mind. A lexical comparison of both texts completes this examination. Next, an investigation of Ay's deeds related in the inscription reveals the importance of the notion of benefactions (Ax.t), with the speos of el-Salamuni being an exemplification of what being Ax means for the king. Furthermore, although Ay's deeds praised by Nakhtmin in his eulogy look like a collection of random deeds, they do in fact illustrate different facets of the one pivotal and dominant deed that is central to Ay's actions: the restoration of communication between the gods, the king and the people, for which purpose the speos happens to be a medium. This investigation also shows that by recourse to the Prophecy, Ay is made into a messianic king, likened to Ameny. Then, in order to explore the reason of the recourse to the Prophecy of Neferti, the speeches of Neferti and Nakhtmin are considered in relation to each other. Based on their common witnessing function, it can be deduced that the author of the inscription considered Neferti to be a true prophecy. This leads to the question of the genre of the Prophecy and of el-Salamuni's inscription. It is proposed that the inscription is an epideictic text. For convincingly classifying el-Salamuni's inscription as a rhetorical epideictic composition coming under the Aristotelian rhetoric, the essential features of this genre are sought. As a matter of fact, an audience, a kairos, an appropriate ethos for the speaker, an argumentation founded on the logos, but also a strong pathos, can be characterised. As for the thesis of the discourse, it is understood that if the communication with the gods is restored and if the people take advantage of it, it is thanks to Ay's personal values. The temporality of Nakhtmin's encomium, who relates events from his present, the focus of the text on virtue, as well as its dispositio, complete the list of the essential features of an epideictic composition. In conclusion, the notion of propaganda is reassessed, and el-Salamuni's inscription as an epideictic text reinstated as a long-term socio-political discourse, as a composition admittedly aimed at establishing absolute confidence of the audience in Ay, but also at reinforcing social cohesion and cultural identity, a function probably required after the Amarna Period.				benoit.lurson@uclouvain.be			Alexander von Humboldt FoundationAlexander von Humboldt Foundation	This study has been conducted in the frame of the project 'Rhetorik und Baupolitik im Agypten der spaten 18.

Hermes is an ontology-based framework for building news personalization services. It uses an ontology crafted from available news sources, allowing users to select and filter interesting concepts from a domain ontology. The Aethalides framework enhances the Hermes framework by enabling news classification through lexicographic and semantic properties. For this, Aethalides applies word sense disambiguation and ontology learning methods to news items. When tested on a set of news items on finance and politics, the Aethalides implementation yields a precision and recall of 74.4% and 49.4%, respectively, yielding an F-0.5-measure of 67.6% when valuing precision more than recall.

J	Simaki, V; Paradis, C; Kerren, A				Simaki, Vasiliki; Paradis, Carita; Kerren, Andreas			A two-step procedure to identify lexical elements of stance constructions in discourse from political blogs	CORPORA			English	Article						Blogs; Brexit; corpus annotation; meta-annotation; social media text analysis; stance construction; stance-taking		The Brexit Blog Corpus (BBC) is a collection of texts extracted from political blogs, which, in a recent study, was annotated according to a cognitive-functional stance framework by two independent annotators (Annotator A and B) using semantic criteria (Simaki et al., 2017). The goal was to label the stance or stances taken based on the overall meaning of a set of utterances. The annotators were not instructed to identify the lexical forms that were used to express the stances. In this study, we make use of those stance-labelled utterances as a springboard to approach stance-taking in text from the opposite point of view, namely from how stance is realised through language. Our aim is to provide a description of the specific lexical elements used to express six stance categories (i.e., CONTRARIETY, HYPOTHETICALITY, NECESSITY, PREDICTION, SOURCE OF KNOWLEDGE and UNCERTAINTY). To this end, we followed a two-step experimental procedure. First, we performed a quantitative analysis of the stance-labelled utterances in order to identify the lexical realisations of each stance category. Second, we carried out a meta-annotation of the data. Annotator B was instructed to single out the actual lexical forms of the constructions that triggered his semantic stance category decisions. This meta-annotation procedure made it possible for us to sift out the most salient lexical realisations of the constructions of each of the six category types on the basis of the qualitative assessments made by Annotator B. We then compared the results of the quantitative and the qualitative approaches, and we present a list of shared stance expressions for each stance category type.

In the present study, we examined associations between language use on Facebook and problematic alcohol use. We collected texts shared on Facebook by a sample of 296 adult social media users (66.9% females; mean age = 28.44 years (SD = 7.38)). Texts were mined using the closed-vocabulary approach based on the Linguistic Inquiry Word Count (LIWC) semantic dictionary, and an open-vocabulary approach performed via Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). Then, we examined associations between emerging textual features and alcohol-drinking scores as assessed using the AUDIT-C questionnaire. As a final aim, we employed the Random Forest machine-learning algorithm to determine and compare the predictive accuracy of closed- and open-vocabulary features over users' AUDIT-C scores. We found use of words about family, school, and positive feelings and emotions to be negatively associated with alcohol use and problematic drinking, while words suggesting interest in sport events, politics and economics, nightlife, and use of coarse language were more frequent among problematic drinkers. Results coming from LIWC and LDA analyses were quite similar, but LDA added information that could not be retrieved only with LIWC analysis. Furthermore, open-vocabulary features outperformed closed-vocabulary features in terms of predictive power over participants' AUDIT-C scores (r = .46 vs. r = .28, respectively). Emerging relationships between text features and offline behaviors may have important implications for alcohol screening purposes in the online environment.

M. Bakhtin; A. M. Selishchev; V. M. Zhivov; IWL RAS		On June 25, 2019 the Institute of world literature of the RAS held a round table discussion "The History of literary institutions of the 1920s-1930s. New research". The relevance of the stated topic is determined by the urgent need for theoretical understanding of a significant amount of new knowledge about the literary process of the first post-revolutionary years, accumulated after the archival revolution of the 1990s facts: writer's biographies, creative stories of texts, literary and intra-literary struggle. The existing conceptual generalizations characterize important aspects of the literary process, but they do not bring much closer to understanding the mechanisms of transformation of the "external" noise of life into the "inner voice" of the creator, reflected in his word, i n his language. Modern linguistics has not yet learned to study the language except by dissecting, decomposing its living body into dead "dictionary" and "grammar". The way out is seen in return to the ideas of Bakhtin, who called to listen to the dialogue in writer's word. The very idea of the word as a dialogical unity implies the need to study the author's word in comparison with the word of his interlocutors - writers, critics, members of literary groups, readers, authorities. Modern sociology helps to differentiate social functions and to find their embodiment in literary practices of writer's unions. The study of the language of literary institutions and the language of writers should become socio-linguistic: the center of research attention should be put to the writer's word came from the socio-political languages and ideologically marked languages of generations.

J	Pribiag, IV				Pribiag, Ioana Vartolomei			Amironner: Notes on Worlding the Local	JOURNAL OF CANADIAN STUDIES-REVUE D ETUDES CANADIENNES			English	Article						Gaston Miron; untranslatable; world literature; Jacques Derrida; Frantz Fanon; Aime Cesaire		How can an untranslatable text be read as world literature? Gaston Miron's only published collection of poetry, L'homme rapaille, is of course a national, and even nationalist, work. While limited translations exist, their failure is inevitable to the extent that Miron's language, beyond its fragmented syntax and play with prosody, abounds with neologisms and elements drawn from deep within the Quebecois lexicon. In fact, the text is, in a sense, against translation as much in its form as in its content. Furthermore, one might expect that the collection's overt political engagement and rootedness in the specific experiences and events of the Quiet Revolution would circumscribe the possibility of an extended readership. However, within the francophone world at least, L'homme rapaille's circulation and influence has far exceeded the borders of Quebec, in large part because its militancy and aesthetics eschew both provincialism and any facile conception of the universal. This article examines how the poetic construction of the "Quebecanthrope," precisely because of its concern for the local and the intimate, and its simultaneous lyrical dialogue with key figures of decolonization (Cesaire, Depestre, Memmi, and Fanon, among others), becomes a gesture of worlding. The article argues for reading Miron as a theorist and practitioner of world literature, viewing Quebec through the lens of relation. I draw on the work of Emily Apter, Vilashini Cooppan, and Jacques Derrida to unpack the implications of Miron's articulation of the local word and the world, focusing on his signed hapax, "amironner."

J	Perez-Perez, M; Perez-Rodriguez, G; Fdez-Riverola, F; Lourenco, A				Perez-Perez, Martin; Perez-Rodriguez, Gael; Fdez-Riverola, Florentino; Lourenco, Analia			Using Twitter to Understand the Human Bowel Disease Community: Exploratory Analysis of Key Topics	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH			English	Article						inflammatory bowel diseases; irritable bowel syndrome; social media; communication; data mining; natural language processing; infodemiology	SOCIAL MEDIA USE; CENTRALITY; PREVALENCE; PROBIOTICS; HEALTH; INFORMATION; GLUTAMINE; NETWORKS; CANCER	Background: Nowadays, the use of social media is part of daily life, with more and more people, including governments and health organizations, using at least one platform regularly. Social media enables users to interact among large groups of people that share the same interests and suffer the same afflictions. Notably, these channels promote the ability to find and share information about health and medical conditions. Objective: This study aimed to characterize the bowel disease (BD) community on Twitter, in particular how patients understand, discuss, feel, and react to the condition. The main questions were as follows: Which are the main communities and most influential users?; Where are the main content providers from?; What are the key biomedical and scientific topics under discussion? How are topics interrelated in patient communications?; How do external events influence user activity?; What kind of external sources of information are being promoted? Methods: To answer these questions, a dataset of tweets containing terms related to BD conditions was collected from February to August 2018, accounting for a total of 24,634 tweets from 13,295 different users. Tweet preprocessing entailed the extraction of textual contents, hyperlinks, hashtags, time, location, and user information. Missing and incomplete information about the user profiles was completed using different analysis techniques. Semantic tweet topic analysis was supported by a lexicon-based entity recognizer. Furthermore, sentiment analysis enabled a closer look into the opinions expressed in the tweets, namely, gaining a deeper understanding of patients' feelings and experiences. Results: Health organizations received most of the communication, whereas BD patients and experts in bowel conditions and nutrition were among those tweeting the most. In general, the BD community was mainly discussing symptoms, BD-related diseases, and diet-based treatments. Diarrhea and constipation were the most commonly mentioned symptoms, and cancer, anxiety disorder, depression, and chronic inflammations were frequently part of BD-related tweets. Most patient tweets discussed the bad side of BD conditions and other related conditions, namely, depression, diarrhea, and fibromyalgia. In turn, gluten-free diets and probiotic supplements were often mentioned in patient tweets expressing positive emotions. However, for the most part, tweets containing mentions to foods and diets showed a similar distribution of negative and positive sentiments because the effects of certain food components (eg, fiber, iron, and magnesium) were perceived differently, depending on the state of the disease and other personal conditions of the patients. The benefits of medical cannabis for the treatment of different chronic diseases were also highlighted. Conclusions: This study evidences that Twitter is becoming an influential space for conversation about bowel conditions, namely, patient opinions about associated symptoms and treatments. So, further qualitative and quantitative content analyses hold the potential to support decision making among health-related stakeholders, including the planning of awareness campaigns.

J	Multhoff, A				Multhoff, Anne			Merchant and marauder-The adventures of a Sabaean clansman	ARABIAN ARCHAEOLOGY AND EPIGRAPHY			English	Article						Ancient Near Eastern history; Ancient South Arabia; incense road; international trade; Sabaic and Minaic inscriptions	INSCRIPTIONS	Ten years ago, a Sabaean inscription on a votive plaque of bronze was made known-immediately attracting the attention of the scholarly world because of its historical implications. This text, which has been given the sigla BL-Nashq ? and Demirjian 1, respectively, by the editors, speaks-among others-about a commercial journey of its author to the north of the Arabian Peninsula-as far as Gaza, Judah, and even Cyprus. While the key message of this account is quite clear, a controversial discussion has evolved around the date of the "war between Chaldaea and Greece" mentioned in the text, thus yielding inconsistent proposals stretching from the seventh up to the early fourth century BC. In the search for possible synchronisms of the events mentioned in the text, however, clear parallels from Ancient South Arabia have almost been neglected. In a number of mostly Minaic inscriptions, first of all RES 3022, some striking lexical and formulaic isoglosses with the Sabaic text can be made out which can hardly be explained by coincidence. A thorough reconsideration of these texts will demonstrate that the events described in BL-Nashq ? = Demirjian 1 could have found resonance in other documents from the region-resulting in a consistent chronological framework for all involved texts. In conclusion, we may watch the story of a Sabaean official in his commercial and diplomatic involvement with northern Arabia and the Levant in the shadow of political tensions within the Achaemenid Empire in the late fifth-early fourth century BCE.

J	Bragina, NG				Bragina, Natalia G.			Speech Missteps in Internet Communication	TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL			Russian	Article						speech missteps; "naive user"; metatextual reactions; online communication; Internet memes; lexicalization; chernomyrdinki (Chernomyrdin's idioms)		The article discusses speech missteps, i.e. errors which a speaker (the one who speaks) or a writer (the one who writes) makes accidentally. One can also do speech missteps if s/he is not good enough in standard Russian. Speech missteps are registered in online communication, and later they can be replicated in different texts. They also can become Internet memes, and/or be used as a kind of a stylistic mark. The aim of the article is to examine some speech missteps and metatextual reactions to them to analyse the way speech missteps function in modern Internet communication. The article considers works in the field of speech errors, namely, in Russian ontolinguistics (S.N. Tseytlin, B.I. Kapinos, M.R. Lvov), Russian stylistics (A.P. Skovorodnikov, A.V. Barinova), grammar of errors (Grammaire des Fautes by H. Frei), corpora of errors (E.V. Rakhilina), erratology (A.B. Shevnin), psycholinguistics (A.A. Zalevskaya), cognitive linguistics (M.V. Rusakova, O.V. Kukushkina). The research methodology was based on discourse analysis, since it combines the analysis of language with the discussion of sociocultural strategies. The article considers speech missteps in Internet communication both as a linguistic and as a sociocultural phenomenon. As a linguistic phenomenon, speech missteps have a tendency to penetrate into common usage and to become standardized. When one uses a well-known speech misstep deliberately, it helps him/her to create expressive and ironic utterances. As a sociocultural phenomenon, speech missteps produce metatextual reactions from participants of online communication. Metatextual reactions to speech missteps transfer communication from the discussion of "what-one-speaks-about" to the discussion of "how-one-speaks". This is a significant feature of modern speech communication. Speech missteps also initiate narratives about the Russian language (its corruption and debasement; the general deterioration of literacy in Russia; funny mistakes in Russian, etc.). The material under analysis is examples of speech missteps which the author collected herself (more than two hundred examples). She also took into account lists of missteps published on Internet sites AdMe.ru, fishki.net, orfosvinstvo (https://vk.com/orfosvinstvo), menya ukusil filolog (https://vk.com/ukusfilologa) etc. Thus, there were approximately 600 units under consideration. More than 30 examples illustrate the main points of the article. The author examined: (a) speech missteps and metatextual reactions to them extracted from a range of comments to articles on colta.ru, an online media outlet; (b) collections of speech missteps published on the Internet sites; (c) blogs in which speech missteps were used to create an ironic effect; (d) a collection of chernomyrdinki (Chernomyrdin's idioms), i.e. spontaneous public statements of Viktor Chernomyrdin, one of the key figures in Russian politics in the 1990s. Chernomyrdin's idioms came to be Internet memes. Now they are considered as units of Russian lexicon. They illustrate how speech missteps enter common usage and become standardized. The results of the study can motivate a further research on the role and function of speech missteps in Internet communication, since they are included in the active processes in modern Russian.

However, despite their focus on conflict in foreign locations, most coding efforts have the limitation of exclusively relying on text written in English. This paper advances the frontier of computerized event coding by presenting the CAMEO Verb Translation Application (VTA), a new technology to enable the translation of CAMEO verb dictionaries into non-English languages. CAMEO VTA integrates automated translation with human-in-the-loop features to increase the validity of the translation task. This development opens the possibility of expanding the leverage of CAMEO in a systematic and efficient manner. The first application of this tool focuses on translating CAMEO into Spanish.

J	Santos, IA; Martins, C; Pereira, I				Santos, Isabel Almeida; Martins, Cristina; Pereira, Isabel			Word formation patterns in Mirandese: derived event and quality nouns in academic discourse	LABORHISTORICO			Portuguese	Article						Lexicalcreation; Derivation processes; Derived nouns; Mirandese language; Linguistic standardization		The expansion of the language domains in which Mirandese is currently used has created the demandfor new words as to fulfill new expressive needs, namely in academic discourse. The creation of words through derivation has been achieved by manipulating attested Mirandese morphological bases and suffixes, or by simply taking corresponding Portuguese derived words as models. The main patterns used in generating these types of products were observed though the analysis of a corpus of academic texts, focusing on derived event and quality nouns. Results reveal -miento/-mento as the most productive suffix in generating Mirandese event nouns, and -(i/e/a)dade as the most productive suffix in generating quality nouns. A stable association between morphological bases and affixes was also observed, even if alomorphic variation does affect both of these morphological constituents, and especially suffixes. Item analysis did not unveilclearphonomorphological constraints governing the distribution of the different suffix alomorphs. As such, alomorphyseemsto be a symptom of the Mirandese standardization process still in progress, yet far from stabilization.

A Lexicon of Concepts of Humanistic Medicine: Exploring Different Meanings of Caring and Compassion at One Organization	ACADEMIC MEDICINE			English	Article							DISCOURSE ANALYSIS; CARE	Purpose There has been scant scholarly attention paid to characterizing how the numerous definitions of terms associated with compassion and humanism have been mobilized or what the organizational implications of pursuing different constructs might be. This study explored the uses and implications of the terminology associated with humanistic medicine in the work of the Associated Medical Services (AMS) Phoenix Project. Method This study involved two phases (2014-2015). First, two pilot group workshops with AMS Phoenix Project participants and stakeholders were conducted to explore ways of parsing and interpreting core concepts used in the project. The authors then assembled an archive of texts associated with the project, comprising the project website and blog posts, conference proceedings, and fellowship and grant applications. Informed by critical discourse analysis, the authors identified, described, and analyzed core terms related to the project's mission and explored the type of health care practices and reforms implied by their use. Results Two recurring core terms, care/caring and compassion, and eight clusters of terms related to these core terms were identified in the archive. Caring and compassion as terms were articulated in various psychological, sociological, and political configurations. This polysemy reflected a diverse array of health care reform agendas. Conclusions Understanding how different interpretations of caring and compassion cluster around core topics and concerns of humanistic medicine offers scholars an entry point for comparing and appraising the quality and direction of reform agendas, including multilevel strategies that involve systems-level changes.

J	Volpi, A				Volpi, Alessandro			Rebels without politics. The events of a term in 19th century Italian dictionaries	ARCHIVIO STORICO ITALIANO			Italian	Article								The text examines the different definitions of the term rebellion contained in the Dictionaries of the first part of the nineteenth century, from which emerges a relevant distance from the political meaning assigned to the term itself; the elaboration of a common language of Italians tended to resort, in the case of rebellion, to examples and expressions taken from remote history and religious repertoires, excluding any revolutionary contamination. In this sense, the distance between the Dictionaries and the regulatory codifications established in those years was also evident.

J	Dahal, B; Kumar, SAP; Li, ZL				Dahal, Biraj; Kumar, Sathish A. P.; Li, Zhenlong			Topic modeling and sentiment analysis of global climate change tweets	SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS AND MINING			English	Article							NETWORK	Social media websites can be used as a data source for mining public opinion on a variety of subjects including climate change. Twitter, in particular, allows for the evaluation of public opinion across both time and space because geotagged tweets include timestamps and geographic coordinates (latitude/longitude). In this study, a large dataset of geotagged tweets containing certain keywords relating to climate change is analyzed using volume analysis and text mining techniques such as topic modeling and sentiment analysis. Latent Dirichlet allocation was applied for topic modeling to infer the different topics of discussion, and Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner was applied for sentiment analysis to determine the overall feelings and attitudes found in the dataset. These techniques are used to compare and contrast the nature of climate change discussion between different countries and over time. Sentiment analysis shows that the overall discussion is negative, especially when users are reacting to political or extreme weather events. Topic modeling shows that the different topics of discussion on climate change are diverse, but some topics are more prevalent than others. In particular, the discussion of climate change in the USA is less focused on policy-related topics than other countries.

In order to make this research possible, we used Python 3.6.4 and the Searchtweets 1.6.1 library for consumption of the API Search Twitter, from which it was possible to extract 76,690 tweets. Text sentiment analysis was carried out through the Lexicon-Based Approach method and the Laplacian Smoothing calculation algorithm-which generated a rate that would represent a negative and a positive sentiment ranging from -0.1306 (minimum) to 0.1489 (maximum) respectively, throughout the observed period. As additional tools, WordCloud and t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) Corpus Visualization were used for visualization of the word cloud and cluster, respectively, with both functionalities available at the Yellowbrick 0.8 package also for Python.

It is an accepted fact that political discourse is, unsurprisingly, a discourse made for politicians. The main function of the political text is the function of speech impact. Linguists that study political discourse are interested in how exactly language tools are used by the author to express different political statements. The subjects of study are, in this case, those language tools that can be used to influence the conversationalist. Antithesis is, as commonly known, a figure of speech, which is built on contrast of comparable concepts. In terms of creation, antithesis can be represented by two words or two groups of words that are related to each other by the lexical and contextual antonymy. The article is focused on how modern Russian politicians are using antithesis in their speeches. The main method of this research is the conceptual analysis, which can produce detailed analysis of text fragments, where antithesis is used, and analyze the dependency of meanings of the words that create antithesis itself in terms of context. In a study, the continuous sampling and linguistic observation and description methods were used. The article analyzes speeches of such prominent Russian politicians as V.V. Putin, S.V. Lavrov and V.V. Zhirinovsky. Particular emphasis in this study has been placed on the antithesis usage by politicians. Certain conclusions related to the usage of antithesis in Russian political discourse have been made. Antithesis is a powerful persuasive tool in the political discourse. The main features of current research and the collected factual material can be interesting to the specialists in the discourse field and also can be used while creating training courses for communication and special courses for researching of political discourse specificity in the modern Russian society.

J	Molodychenko, EN				Molodychenko, Evgeni N.			"Us" vs "Them" in Political Discourse: The Instrumental Function of the "Evil Other" in American Presidential Rhetoric	VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA FILOLOGIYA-TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF PHILOLOGY			Russian	Article						discourse analysis; pragmatic interpretation; persuasion; political discourse; rhetoric; presidential rhetoric; "Us" vs "Them"	DISCURSIVE LEGITIMATION STRATEGIES; WAR; CONSTRUCTION; ARGUMENTATION; IDENTITY	The article investigates the textualization of the categories "Us" and "Them" in American presidential rhetoric in two interrelated ways: as an inventory of lexicogrammatical resources specific to this genre and their contextualized use as a tool for legitimizing political decisions. For this purpose, several speeches by Donald Trump and George W. Bush have been analyzed. Methodologically, the study draws on the discourse analytical toolkit which involves exploring evaluative labels for category members, as well as metaphors, leitmotifs (or topoi), and syllogisms. These various language resources are not treated separately but rather as making up two distinct discourse strategies. The analysis shows that one pervasive discourse strategy in the sample is the strategy of out-casting the "evil other". The primary means of out-casting and populating this category is negative evaluative lexis, which is extensively used for naming and identifying the members of the "evil" out-group. Another persistent exponent of this strategy is a set of leitmotifs, which are used to attribute certain qualities and features to out-group members and characterize their actions. The most salient leitmotifs in the rhetoric of both presidents are threat and killing the innocent, which are very frequent in any references to terrorists, who are the core members of the out-group. It is worth noting that the usage of these linguistic resources is very consistent within this genre of presidential rhetoric irrespective of who the rhetor is and the specific historical context. The further analysis of the sample shows that out-casting is inextricably linked to another pervasive discourse strategy: legitimation of going to or continuing the war in a given country. For Trump, it is primarily the military campaign in Afghanistan, while for Bush the target country was primarily Iraq. In both cases, the legitimation of the contradictory move seems to hinge largely on whether the country in question can be convincingly placed into the "Them" category. Linguistically, the most popular way to do so is through the leitmotif of "safe haven", which is used to indicate that a certain country houses, supports, and is, indeed, a safe haven for terrorists. Interestingly, the category seems to be structured as a fuzzy set, with the inclusion into the out-group being, as it were, a matter of degree. Thus, in Trump's speech Pakistan is construed as a member of the out-group only to some extent, which translates into less strict measures directed against it. At the core of legitimation strategy is argumentation that relies on syllogisms. The assumed major premises of syllogisms used by both presidents are very similar, which makes them a type of leitmotifs. These leitmotifs are arguably also part of the genre's inventory of rhetorical resources albeit the ones that are never expressed in the surface structure and have no language associated with them.

It examines what Garofalo (2017: 56) dubs "axiological items" or evaluative lexical units that express emotional engagement in laws and how differences arise due to the particular legal culture involved. The corpus analysed is made up of Spain's Organic Law 1/2004, on Integral Protection Measures against Gender Violence and the Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Act 2004 of England and Wales. A two-stage analysis is provided. Stage One performs automated processing using Antconc 2.0 (Anthony, 2014) to obtain a listing of keywords indicative of importance and frequency in each law of the terms belonging to the legal sphere and those fashioning the conceptual framework for domestic and gender violence, respectively. The second stage examines them from the perspective of sentiment analysis, specifically using the Lingmotif v.1.0 software package (Moreno Ortiz, 2017) in order to study the polarity (positive, negative or neutral) and the intensity of sentiment in these two legislative texts, by means of a detailed lexical analysis carried out by said application.

J	Surman, J				Surman, Jan			Science and Terminology in-between Empires: Ukrainian Science in a Search for its Language in the nineteenth century	HISTORY OF SCIENCE			English	Article						Habsburg Empire; imperial science; science and nation-building; scientific language; Ukraine		Ukrainian science and its terminology in the nineteenth century experienced a number of twists and turns. Divided between two empires, it lacked institutions, scholars pursuing it, and a unified literary language. One could even say that until the late nineteenth century there was a possibility for two communities with two literary languages to emerge - Ruthenian (Habsburg Empire) and Ukrainian (Russian Empire). Eventually, both communities and languages merged. This article tracks the meanderings of this process, arguing that scholarly publications played a crucial role in shaping the standard for the scientific language. The article follows the biography of the naturalist Ivan Verhrats'kyi (1846-1919), the author of the first dictionaries of naturalist terminology in Ruthenian in 1860, a translator and author of textbooks, and the head of the Mathematical-Naturalist-Medical Section of the Shevchenko Society in L'viv. He thus shaped many Ruthenian, and then Ruthenian-Ukrainian scholarly projects. Initially successful with his approach to making the Ruthenian scientific language vernacular, in the 1890s his approach was losing ground to the internationalization of vocabulary and to the growing pressure toward the unification of Ruthenian and Ukrainian. Finally, in the beginning of the twentieth century, Verhrats'kyi became marginalized within the Ukrainian scholarly community. By discussing the history of a minority language within imperial structures, I argue that the media in which scholarly work was published requires special attention. In the Ruthenin-Ukrainian case, they determined the standard for scientific language. Lacking professional journals, Ruthenian scholars published in the 1860s-late 1880s in popular newspapers and in school textbooks, requiring them to use a language that was near to the spoken tongue of the Habsburg province. Once the political situation changed, favoring Ruthenian-Ukrainian unification, and scholarly journals appeared and transgressed the imperial boundary, the favored language had to be transimperial, ousting out the vernacular.

Our aim, by focusing on a single text, is to demonstrate the role of an intensive analysis of 'outstanding' singular texts within the broad field of discourse analysis. The analysis is rooted within a positive discourse analysis (PDA) framework, with special focus on lexical choices and variation, modality, intertextuality/interdiscursivity, metaphorical representations, ideological use of pronouns, indexical meaning, and strategies of argumentation. Through these rhetorical techniques, we illustrate how an independence leader constructs an emancipatory discourse aimed at reconciling the ideas and beliefs of the leaders of two continents that have a common history of colonialism. The study sheds light on the role of key speeches and political leaders in promoting an emancipatory discourse, and exemplifies how (presidential) rhetoric can be construed as offering a message of hope, strength, and inspiration while playing the role of a unifier, thereby highlighting the major underlying assumption of PDA: a commitment to a discourse of social change.

Using Social Media to Identify Consumers' Sentiments towards Attributes of Health Insurance during Enrollment Season	APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL			English	Article						social media; Twitter; text mining; sentiment analysis; word association; health insurance; provider networks	CARE; CONTINUITY; CHOICE; BENEFITS; PREMIUMS	This study aims to identify sentiments that consumers have about health insurance by analyzing what they discuss on Twitter. The objective was to use sentiment analysis to identify attitudes consumers express towards health insurance and health care providers. We used an Application Programming Interface to gather tweets from Twitter with the words health insurance or health plan during health insurance enrollment season in the United States in 20162017. Word association was used to find words associated with premium, access, network, and switch. Sentiment analysis established which specific emotions were associated with insurance and medical providers, using the NRC Emotion Lexicon, identifying emotions. We identified that provider networks, prescription drug benefits, political preferences, and norms of other consumers matter. Consumers trust medical providers but they fear unexpected health events. The results suggest that there is a need for different algorithms to help consumers find the plans they want and need. Consumers buying health insurance in the Affordable Care Act marketplaces in the United States choose lower-cost plans with limited benefits, but at the same time express fear about unexpected health events and unanticipated costs. If we better understand the origin of the sentiments that drive consumers, we may be able to help them better navigate insurance plan options and insurers can better respond to their needs.

This argument is based on the analysis of some some approaches to the comprehension of nature in gender studies and pontifical documents. Far from being merely an epistemological clash, the political relevance of the gender category and its intrinsic relationship with feminism emerges. Moreover, we discuss how scientific and doctrinal lexicons slide into a society where there is a political confrontation between two movements: feminism and anti-gender campaigns, the latter with transnational dimensions that surpass the conservative groups of Christianity that lead them.

J	Shobe, J				Shobe, Jarrod			Enacted Legislative Findings and Purposes	UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO LAW REVIEW			English	Article							STATUTORY INTERPRETATION; SUPREME-COURT; CONGRESSIONAL OVERRIDES; HISTORY; TEXTUALISM; DELEGATION; DECISIONS; DEFERENCE; POLITICS; CANON	Statutory interpretation scholarship generally imagines a sharp divide between statutory text and legislative history. This Article shows that scholars have failed to consider the implications of a hybrid type of text that is enacted by Congress and signed by the president, but which looks like legislative history. This text commonly appears at the beginning of a bill under headings such as "Findings" and "Purposes." This enacted text often provides a detailed rationale for legislation and sets out Congress's intent and purposes. Notably, it is drafted in plain language by political congressional staff rather than technical drafters, so it may be the portion of the enacted text that is most accessible to members of Congress and their high-level staff. Despite enacted findings and purposes' apparent importance to interpretation, courts infrequently reference them and lack a coherent theory of how they should be used in statutory interpretation. In most cases in which courts have referenced them, they have relegated them to a status similar to that of unenacted legislative history despite the fact that they are less subject to formalist and pragmatic objections. Perhaps because courts have infrequently and inconsistently relied on enacted findings and purposes, scholars have also failed to consider them, so their relevance to statutory interpretation has gone mostly unrecognized and untheorized in the legal literature. This Article argues that all of the enacted text of a statute must be read together and with equal weight, as part of the whole law Congress enacted, to come up with an interpretation that the entire text can bear. This is more likely to generate an interpretation in line with Congress's intent than a mode of interpretation that focuses on the specific meaning of isolated terms based on dictionaries, canons, unenacted legislative history, or other unenacted tools. This Article shows that, when textualists' formalist arguments against legislative history are taken off the table, there may be less that divides textualists from purposivists. Enacted findings and purposes may offer a text-based, and therefore more constrained and defensible, path forward for purposivism, which has been in retreat in recent decades in the face of strong textualist attacks.

J	Whiteside, K; Wharton, S				Whiteside, Karin; Wharton, Sue			Semantic patterning of grammatical keywords in undergraduate academic writing from two close disciplines	JOURNAL OF ENGLISH FOR ACADEMIC PURPOSES			English	Article						Student disciplinary writing; Corpus approaches; Grammatical keywords; Phraseology; Semantic patterning	REPORTING CLAUSES; ENGLISH; CORPUS; GENRE; SPECIFICITY; STANCE	Contributing to the growing body of research on student texts, and the construct of disciplinarity at undergraduate level, this study involves a lexico-grammatical analysis of successful third-year student writing in two UK HE institutions from the disciplines of History and of Politics and International Relations. We use an inductive corpus approach in which the phraseological patterning around five grammatical keywords (of, and, that, as and this) is categorised according to semantic purpose. More similarities than variations were found across the four disciplinary/institutional sub-corpora, and, to a large extent, these similarities can be explained in terms of the shared foci of student Humanities and Social Sciences writing. From a practitioner perspective, we argue that the approach uncovers meaning-focused lexico-grammatical features of very high value due to their extremely regular occurrence within student texts. With regard to the EGAP versus ESAP debate, we suggest that an argument can be made for the teaching of 'meta-disciplinary' literacy skills. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, there has been less attention to exactly who is using such economic discourse and how it is combined with other discourses. Prior researchers have proposed tripartite frameworks for categorizing discursive strategies around pro-economic, anti-economic, and non-economic metaphors, which are here applied to eight U.S. environmental advocacy organizations' press releases. An original text-analytic dictionary of pro-economic, anti-economic, and non-economic discourse is used to distinguish between the proposed discourse strategies. This analysis indicates that economics-oriented discourse strategies are more complex and varied than previously suggested. A more nuanced framework is proposed.

In this piece, we detail the approach we developed to tackle the analysis of the context-dependent content of political incivility. After describing our manually validated organic dictionaries approach, we compare the method to others we could have used and then replicate the method in a different-but still context-dependent-project examining political issue content on social media. We conclude by summarizing the strengths and weaknesses of the approach and offering suggestions for future research that can refine and expand the method.

Nearly 70% of US adults use some social media. However, rigorous research across different social media is vital to establish successful evidence-based health communication strategies that meet the requirements of the evolving digital landscape and the needs of diverse populations. Objective: The aim of this study was to expand and test a software tool (Trial Promoter) to support health promotion and education research by automating aspects of the generation, distribution, and assessment of large numbers of social media health messages and user comments. Methods: The tool supports 6 functions (1) data import, (2) message generation deploying randomization techniques, (3) message distribution, (4) import and analysis of message comments, (5) collection and display of message performance data, and (6) reporting based on a predetermined data dictionary. The tool was built using 3 open-source software products: PostgreSQL, Ruby on Rails, and Semantic UI. To test the tool's utility and reliability, we developed parameterized message templates (N=102) based upon 2 government-sponsored health education campaigns, extracted images from these campaigns and a free stock photo platform (N=315), and topic-related hashtags (N=4) from Twitter. We conducted a functional correctness analysis of the generated social media messages to assess the algorithm's ability to produce the expected output for each input. We defined 100% correctness as use of the message template text and substitution of 3 message parameters (ie, image, hashtag, and destination URL) without any error. The percent correct was calculated to determine the probability with which the tool generates accurate messages. Results: The tool generated, distributed, and assessed 1275 social media health messages over 85 days (April 19 to July 12, 2017). It correctly used the message template text and substituted the message parameters 100% (1275/1275) of the time as verified by human reviewers and a custom algorithm using text search and attribute-matching techniques. Conclusions: A software tool can effectively support the generation, distribution, and assessment of hundreds of health promotion messages and user comments across different social media with the highest degree of functional correctness and minimal human interaction. The tool has the potential to support social media-enabled health promotion research and practice: first, by enabling the assessment of large numbers of messages to develop evidence-based health communication, and second, by providing public health organizations with a tool to increase their output of health education messages and manage user comments. We call on readers to use and develop the tool and to contribute to evidence-based communication methods in the digital age.

The objective of the study was to analyze the level of knowledge of the competencies held by the public servants of the Executive Secretaries of Rights Protection of the different cantons of the Provinces of Guayas and Bolivar with the purpose of detecting the wrong concepts that testify the acquired ignorance. The method of the research was qualitative (Denzin & Lincoln, 2013) of lexicometric type concerning textual statistics operationalized by the analysis of co-occurring lexemes. We worked with 61 public servants of the prepossessed institutional dependency, of which 41% were male and 59% female whose ages ranged between 29-56 years in all cases with a third level professional title. The selection was through intentional sampling. A questionnaire was applied with two open questions regarding the activities that they carry out within their position in favor of the priority attention groups and people, through a digital form. It was identified that the unconscious incompetence is acclimated to the administrative dogmatic according to the lexicometric data obtained, it was concluded that the professional profiles included in the list should be reviewed and a training plan should be designed and periodical evaluation of the competences, it is important to point out that in this study only the perspective of the public servants of the dependencies of the Rights Protection Councils was addressed, however it is unavoidable to look at the representations from the regulations of the governing bodies of public policy in Ecuador.

J	Kazhherova, VV				Kazhherova, Varvara V.			PUBLIC HEALTH IN THE RUSSIAN MEDIA'S NEWS AGENDA	VESTNIK MOSKOVSKOGO UNIVERSITETA. SERIYA 10. ZHURNALISTIKA			Russian	Article						public health; human health; media; research; news agenda		This paper is one of many concerned with making Russian society realize that public health results from the interaction between the state and the citizen, governmental and public organizations, businesses, science and the media. The aim of the author is to inform the scientific community about the results of studying the Russian media's practice of covering health-related issues. The essence of the hypothesis assumed by the author is that given a lot of materials dealing with health newspapers and magazines are not guided by a systematic approach to the institution of public health and consider it through the prism of individual aspects. The materials for the study were selected with the help of the Medialogy analytical system and then looked through by the author in a manual way. The selected articles were studied by means of professional analysis of journalistic text and comparative analysis. Professional analysis of texts is a scientific method suggesting the use of observation tables, which include the headlines of the articles, their sources, genre and results of examining their basic characteristics: theme, idea, text structure, composition, layout, lexical and stylistic features. Such tables make the texts comparable and enable one to juxtapose them and obtain necessary generalizations. On the basis of observations, a comparative analysis of the texts is conducted. As a result of this two-stage analysis, the researcher finds her hypothesis confirmed and concludes about the factors that prevent journalists from becoming stakeholders of the institution of public health.

J	Kolmogorova, AV				Kolmogorova, A., V			Conceptualization of norm in language: from norm of psychic state to the social interaction norm (as based on Russian adjectives "vmenyayemyy" and "nevmenyayemyy" analysis)	SIBIRSKII FILOLOGICHESKII ZHURNAL			Russian	Article						lexical-semantic variants; individualization; generalization; Russian speech practice; conceptualization of norm and anomaly; lexicographical description of adjectives		The paper focuses on the semantic description of Russian adjectives related to the notion of the psychic norm - vmenyayemyy ('mentally healthy, able to act consciously') and nevmenyayemyy ('mentally insane, unable to be responsible for his actions'). Originally used in the forensic examination discourse, both lexemes were successfully integrated into less specific areas of Russian communicative practice. This study applies the methodology of distributive, contextual and semantic analysis of lexemes concerned to describe their meanings in politic, publicist, consumerist discourses, everyday small-talk practice and modern fiction texts. Our research corpus includes 220 utterances with vmenyayemyy and 282 - with nevmenyayemyy extracted from the National Corpus of Russian Language, supported by examples from Internet resources and statistic data on the lexemes' frequency displayed by Google Books Ngram Viewer service. The author describes five distributive types of nevmenyayemyy and four common distributions of its antonym and proposes a draft of their general semantic interpretation. The results also show a metonymic extension of the concept of norm deeply implicated in the semantics of adjective vmenyayemyy: from primary idea of a normal psychic state through its behavioural manifestations to a vast notion of socially expected and anticipated interaction and its results. Thus, vmenyayemyy acquires the new function of the norm operator allowing native speakers to categorise the complex world of reality into two classes of entities: the one that corresponds to the norm of social interaction, and the one that does not. Such functional transformation results in more frequent use of this lexeme.

This technique has become an essential part of a wide range of applications including politics, business, advertising and marketing. There are various techniques for sentiment analysis, but recently word embeddings methods have been widely used in sentiment classification tasks. Word2Vec and GloVe are currently among the most accurate and usable word embedding methods which can convert words into meaningful vectors. However, these methods ignore sentiment information of texts and need a large corpus of texts for training and generating exact vectors. As a result, because of the small size of some corpora, researcher often have to use pre-trained word embeddings which were trained on other large text corpora such as Google News with about 100 billion words. The increasing accuracy of pre-trained word embeddings has a great impact on sentiment analysis research. In this paper, we propose a novel method, Improved Word Vectors (IWV), which increases the accuracy of pre-trained word embeddings in sentiment analysis. Our method is based on Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging techniques, lexicon-based approaches, word position algorithm and Word2Vec/GloVe methods. We tested the accuracy of our method via different deep learning models and benchmark sentiment datasets. Our experiment results show that Improved Word Vectors (IWV) are very effective for sentiment analysis. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

J	Richter, A; Ng, KTW; Fallah, B				Richter, Amy; Ng, Kelvin Tsun Wai; Fallah, Bahareh			Bibliometric and text mining approaches to evaluate landfill design standards	SCIENTOMETRICS			English	Article						Landfill design guidelines and regulations; Rank-frequency relationship; Radar charts; Lexical quantification; Spearman rank correlation; Bibliometric analysis and text mining	WASTE MANAGEMENT; GROUNDWATER; REQUIREMENTS; OPTIMIZATION; IMPROVEMENT; GENERATION; MODEL	In 2014, Canadians generated 961kg of waste per capita. Landfilling is a logical choice for many Canadian communities because of land availability. This paper examines and compares five different design criteria from provincial standards and guidelines in British Columbia, Alberta, Manitoba, Nova Scotia, and the Northwest Territories. Text mining including word counts, word frequency analysis, lexical quantification, and the Gunning-Fog Index are used to identify linguistic and stylistic features in the corpora. Results show that design standards and guidelines tend to be driven by climate, demographic, and environmental considerations. Rank-frequency analysis showed that the design standards were non-Zipfian (0.409<exponent<0.681), but a power relationship generally fit well (0.90<R-2<0.99). Lexical density and the Gunning-Fog Index do not consider content in figures and tables, which are key components in engineering design standards and guidelines, so a Table and Figure Factor was developed. The factor was negatively (R-2=0.735; Slope=-1.1) related to lexical density, supporting the use of tables and figures in engineering design standards and guidelines. Comparing equivalent word counts in standards to landfilling rate and landfills per capita yielded better results (Spearman R=-0.7, p=0.08) compared to government expenditure on waste management. Lexical density and Gunning-Fog Index may be good metrics when comparing landfill efficiency metrics. The study's outcomes may help to develop better landfill design standards in English speaking countries.

Propaganda Content in Digital Space: Identification Markers	PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2019 IEEE COMMUNICATION STRATEGIES IN DIGITAL SOCIETY SEMINAR (2019 COMSDS)			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Communication Strategies in Digital Society Seminar (ComSDS)	APR 10, 2019	Saint Petersburg Electrotechn Univ LETI, St. Petersburg, RUSSIA	IEEE	Saint Petersburg Electrotechn Univ LETI	political communication; propaganda; computer propaganda; pension reform; social networks; digital space		The article discusses the current forms and channels of propaganda in the network space. Despite the fact that the methods and technologies of propaganda in its classic version are described in detail, in recent decades, the methods of propaganda influence have become more disguised and sophisticated: from the creation of bots in social networks to the fabrication of images and newspaper covers. In such circumstances, it is extremely difficult to distinguish between true and false content, so the problem of selecting criteria for propaganda content is of particular importance today. The aim of the study is to identify the features of propaganda content in a digital society. The objectives of the research project include: the definition of "propaganda content" concept, the forms of its expression, the search for criteria to distinguish propaganda content from other types of information dissemination in social networks. The open materials of such programs as Hamilton 68, Digital Sherlocks, as well as the research of Computational Propaganda Worldwide conducted in Oxford were taken as an object. It is because of these and similar projects that the term "computer propaganda" is firmly entrenched in the scientific lexicon. The research methodology is based on the works of J. Bolsover, F. Howard, and a number of other foreign and domestic authors, indicating the following formats as components of promotional content in online communities: cyberattacks, bot farms, automatic distribution of posts on social networks, theft of data and disinformation. They are usually distributed simultaneously to maximize the coverage of the same information. The main methods of the study were case studies and content analysis. With their help, the case that caused social tension and long-term negative consequences (pension reform of 2018 in Russia) is considered. The analysis of the text format of information about this case, posted on social networks Facebook and Twitter, led to a number of conclusions: the methods used to identify propaganda content, require further serious study. The method of content analysis widely used for this purpose and the relatively recent method of intent analysis, due to the lack of the necessary methodology, are not always able to determine the availability of methods of propaganda influence. The results of the study allow us to state: computer propaganda in the modern world is very effective, including free or very inexpensive distribution. Moreover, the speed and the maximum number of users outreach by propaganda content become major issues. Today, social networks are a real arena of struggle, and the arsenal of propaganda means of influence is increasing exponentially. In these circumstances, the development of propaganda content identification methods can serve as a guarantor of success in the fight. This aspect is especially important in the long term, as in this way you can beat the competition and build the right communication strategy.

Halliday and Hasan identified five different types of cohesion: reference, substitution, ellipsis, conjunction and lexical cohesion in the text. This study uses the selected weekly articles authored by Cyril Almeida from well-known daily published English Newspaper "The Daily Dawn". Analysis of text comprises Halliday and Hasan's cohesion model, and analyzes linguistic techniques used in newspaper texts. The study finds repeated occurrences of cohesive devices such as referencing, substitution, ellipsis, conjunction, and lexical cohesion. Moreover, reiteration is found to be the most frequently occurring cohesive device. Reference from grammatical cohesion also outnumbers all other subcategories of cohesion. In addition, many of the literary terms employed in articles make it diverse in uncovering some of the political contexts to the audience. Hence, it concludes that in the overall occurrences of lexical cohesion, reiteration and collocation are dominant; suggesting that the texts of selected news articles of Cyril Almeida are cohesive mainly because of lexical cohesion, i.e. semantic linkage through vocabulary rather than grammar.

The objectives of this paper are i) to describe the neologisms of the Venezuelan political and economic sphere, and ii) to describe the most frequent lexical-genetic processes found in the corpus of analysis. The corpus of this study is composed of journalistic texts, extracted from the electronic portals of the Venezuelan newspapers: El Nacional and Ultimas Noticias. The cases were recorded in lexicographic sheets and were subjected to the contrast analysis with a corpus of exclusion composed by i) lexicographic works, ii) glossaries of previous research on the topic and iii) the data base of neologisms of the Instituto Cervantes. The results indicate that the neologisms identified in the corpus are mostly formal and a case of semantic neologism.

J	Alekseev, AV				Alekseev, Alexander, V			PROCESS OF CONTRACTING HASHTAGS IN MODERN VIRTUAL COMMUNICATION	NAUCHNYI DIALOG			Russian	Article						language compression; hashtags; abbreviation; virtual discourse; sociolinguistics; political contractions		The article is devoted to the study of language compression, presented in one lexical unit at two different levels: graphic and semantic. The relevance of the study is due to the need to understand the basic social and political processes presented in the texts of modern virtual communication in order to identify the most important events at the present stage of development of society through linguistic analysis. The novelty of the study is that the analysis of hashtags in the English language is carried out for the first time from the perspective of the contraction process, examples of such linguistic facts are presented. Particular attention is paid to the processes of deciphering hashtags in the English language and the explication of the reduced lexical unit in the target language. It is emphasized that the principle of saving speech effort is most common in the texts of modern virtual communication. The question of the trans lingual aspect of the functioning of English-speaking hashtags that are subject to the process of contraction in speech is considered. Using statistical analysis, two main ideas have been proved regarding the linguistic nature of these language units: the contraction process is formative when they are created; the use of contracted hashtags in political texts seems to be a common and natural phenomenon in virtual discourse.

First, it shows that there are significant differences between the 1980 and 2005 fatwas. Second, in terms of their lexicon, the 1980 fatwa uses the phrase "di luar Islam" (outside Islam), while the 2005 fatwa uses the phrase "berada di luar Islam" (located outside Islam). Third, there is an emphasis on the responsibilities of the government within the 2005 fatwa on Ahmadiyya. Fourth, the 1980 fatwa was directed at the Qadiyan Ahmadiyya, while the 2005 fatwa was directed at all elements of Ahmadiyya. Fifth, the form of the 2005 fatwa is reminiscent of a legal proclamation. This strongly affected the violence experienced by Ahmadiyya, as the fatwa was no longer presented as an opinion, but as a legally binding decision.

J	Amendola, S				Amendola, Stefano			XENOI AND GREEKS BETWEEN OPPOSITION AND 'HYBRIDIZATION'. SOME OBSERVATIONS ABOUT THE LEXICON OF THE OTHERNESS IN AESCHYLUS' SURVIVED TRAGEDIES	HUMANITAS-PORTUGAL			English	Article						Aeschylus; xenos; Agamemnon; Septem contra Thebes; Supplices		The paper examines the opposition between Greeks and the so-called Others (foreigners, barbarians, etc.) as represented in Aeschylus' surviving plays. This antithesis has become a major focus of scholarly interest not only in philological studies, but also in the modern historical, philosophical and political thought, where it corresponds to the radical opposition between 'Greekness' and 'Otherness', as well as between West and East. By focusing on this topic, the paper presents an innovative interpretation of some aeschylean texts taken from Suppliants, Agamemnon and Seven against Thebes, looking at foreign characters such as Suppliants' Egyptian herald or Agamemnon's Cassandra, but also at ethnically hybrid characters (the Danaids' Chorus of the Suppliants, whose ancient bond with the Argive land is explicit, and Polynices' army, described as an external foreign enemy). The aim of the texts' selection is to capture the interest on Aeschylus' lexis related to the semantic sphere of the foreigner. The assumption is that a methodology based on semantic values (especially of the terms or, and of some compounds such as and) well witnesses how the Aeschylean lexicon maintains the broad semantic spectrum of the term, with the frequent co-presence of the meaning of 'guest' alongside that of 'foreigner'. The argument is that in Aeschylean theatre the Greek/Others polarity is presented not only in terms of a contrast/opposition with Greekness (with the positive element of the pair destined to predominate over the Otherness), but also in terms of intermingling/confusion. Aeschylus is not only the poet of the conflict between Greeks and Barbarians, but also the inventor of collective characters in which Greek and foreign elements constantly co-exist, in order to determine hybrid identities.

The latest trend has deeply transformed the way the governments interact with their citizens and offer them various services through continuous public engagement. The proposed framework SCANCPECLENS is an initiative to support performance assessment framework for e-government in Pakistan. The research takes into account the opinion of masses on one of the most crucial and widely discussed development projects, China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), considered as a game changer due to its promise of bringing economic prosperity to the region. The proposed framework suggests to use machine learning algorithms to automatically discover the public sentiment from microblogs on the matter nationally as well as internationally. We also present an automated way to create sentiment lexicon of positive, negative and neutral words on the subject. To the best of our knowledge, this theme has not been explored for opinion mining before and helps one in effectively assessing public satisfaction over government's policies in the CPEC region. The research is an initiative to discover new avenues of future research and direction for the government, policy making institutions and other stake holders and demonstrates the power of text mining as an effective tool to extract business value from vast amount of social media data.

J	Martos, JA				Antonio Martos, Juan			The Palaeolithic and human evolution in secondary education textbooks during the late Franco period (1967-1976): the making of a legitimated discourse	TRABAJOS DE PREHISTORIA			Spanish	Article						Prehistory; History of Science; Bibliometrics; Didactic contents; Francoist education; Spain		A sample of History and Natural History secondary education textbooks published during the late Franco period is analysed in this paper. From a scientific point of view, Natural History textbooks contain more palaeoanthropological information while History textbooks contain more about the technological and cultural aspects of the Palaeolithic. From an ideological point of view, the lexicon and the incorporation of scientific data both into texts and paratextual resources indicate a will of dis-ideologization in the contents. Nevertheless, two discourses coexist during the early 70's: one entrenched in the preceding decades that did not annoy the political, religious and social members of the regime; and another that introduces discordant elements, such as evolutionism. The second one only becomes predominant in textbooks published after 1975, coinciding with the economic and social changes that started in the 60's in Spain and with the prospect of new freedom after the death of the dictator.

It is the first example of masnavi and poetic political treatise in Turkish Literature. In the KB text, the "language" subject and the issue - except attachments- were dealt with in the thirty couplet in the seventh chapter and ninety couplet in the nineteenth chapter. In the KB text, the "language" subject and the issue - except attachments- were dealt with in thirty couplets in the seventh chapter and the ninety couplets in the nineteenth chapter. The word tongue (til) was used 459 times in KB. Therefore, the word til "tongue" is the most commonly used word among noun type words in KB test. It is recorded that the KB text is approximately 68,000 words. According to this, til "tongue" word is used about 0, 675 percent in the text. Apart from the seventh chapter in the text, it is seen that the til "tongue" word is used in many contexts. In the text index, til word is given "language, speech, dictionary" meanings. It is seen that the frequent use of the word til is considered not just a subject but also an important issue by Yusuf Has Hacip. The three main principles of Sufism are "less talk, less sleep, less food". The proverb "speech is silver, but silence is gold" reflects this insight in Sufism. In KB, the essential thought is "to listen and understand first, then to talk less and when it's necessary". In Kuseyri Epistles samt "silence" is considered to be among the statues and manners of the Sufis. Kuseyri and Hucviri like all other Sufis, thinks that silence and listening are more valuable than speech and talking. Hucviri also dealt with the language issue in Kefu'l-Mahclib in the context of "samt". Agop Dilacar compares and associates KB with a few texts from Western World such as Platon's Politeia and Thomas More's Utopia. One of the seven properties which makes a text a real text is intertextuality. So that, this attitude Agop Dilacar pointed is indisputable. However, comparing KB with other texts written at the same period and level is more accurate approach. Kuseyri's Epistles as Arabic and Hucvir's Kesfu'l-Mahcub as Persian are written in XI. century like Yusuf Has Hilcip's KB. Both of these texts were written before the KB. Maybe Yusuf Has Hacib did not directly contact with Kuseyri and Hucviri, and their works. However, there is deeper connection with these works than Platon's Politeia and Thomas More's Utopia. In this study, the approach of language matter in KB will be compared with Kesfill-Mahclib and Kuseyri Epistle within the context of intertextuality and common parts will be tried to determine.

Thus, we propose a semi-supervised machine learning system, based on a taxonomy of emotionally charged words with three classes, taking into account the neutral polarity class, but also a comparison of results by applying several classification algorithms, such as Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines and our proposed approach. We present aspects about natural language complexity from the sentiment perspective and some language resources, considering a Romanian corpus based on 25,841 news and a Romanian language dictionary containing 42,497 words, which can be used by sentiment analysis systems. The scope of the paper is to identify the utility and usability of multiple data sets in a real-world application, to get relevant results about online comments perception that can provide valuable future perspectives for a nation's social and even political issues. The best result of our implemented system, after having processed the corpus, is over 82%, compared to classical machine learning classification methods with a best score of 70%.

It focuses on the issue of overlapping sovereignties that comes from an original text where there is a massive presence of a plurality of kings (principally called wanax or basileus) over the same groups. The political structures of the Achaean army, the group of the Olympian Gods, the communities of Troy, Ithaca and Scheria are not as compliant with Hobbes's political theories as had been suggested in his political works. In the translations, the philosopher tries to present Agamemnon, Zeus and Priam in the Iliad, and Odysseus and Alcinous in the Odyssey as kings more absolute than they really are in the original poems. With textual examples and a continuous comparison between the Greek and English lines, this Hobbesian intent clearly shines through. The chapter also explores the problematic disappearance of the pastoral image of the king: while the Homeric poems are imbued with the expression poimen laon (shepherd of the people) used to define holders of monocratic power, this metaphor is almost completely removed in the translations. Moving on from textual examples, some possible explanations are suggested. One section analyses the lexicon of kingship - less frequent but worth mentioning - that is not related to wanax, basileus and poimen: uses and Hobbesian translations of kosmetor, eghemon, koiranos, orchamos are shown. The last paragraph is devoted to those situations where Hobbes in his translations chooses to add elements that strengthen the idea of absolute power.

I reflect on the origin, fields of experience and expectatives concentrated in some uses of the concept 'piuco' during the years of the War of the Pacific: a potential demonym, constructed on the basis of his identification with the popular classes of the Chiloe province. It is a concept in the center of the racial discourses, And I relate his trajectory and diverse meanings, both pragmatic and ideological, with the most important process in the nineteenth century history of Chile and Chiloe. Some answers are considered about the possible causes of the frustration of the concept 'piuco' as a demonym equivalent of the current word 'chilote'. The text is based on a revision of differential dictionaries, publications on geography, politics and travels, newspapers of Chiloe and part of the letters of the Intendent Luis Martiniano Rodriguez.

J	Chudinov, AP; Nikiforova, MV				Chudinov, A. P.; Nikiforova, M., V			INDIVIDUAL STYLE OF A POLITICIAN IN THE LIGHT OF THE COMIC	PHILOLOGICAL CLASS			Russian	Article						political discourse; linguistic personality; linguopersonology; politicians; political rhetoric; political speeches; speech; individual style; the comic; the means of expressing the comic		The article analyzes public communication of a well-known Russian public and political figure, ex-Mayor of Ekaterinburg (2013-2018) Eu. V. Roizman. We understand an individual discourse of a politician as a fragment of the national political discourse, which is characterized through the prism of current trends in the development of public communication. One of the trends is the interrelation of political and entertainment discourse in the media, which manifests itself among other things in the active use by politicians and journalists of all kinds of comic tools. In this paper the comic is considered as a linguistic and pragmatic category with a certain semantic content, and a system of means and mechanisms of expression; the means of the comic are expected to provide a certain impact on the recipient of the political text. They vary in the terms of originality and pragmatic functions, and when incorporating into the political discourse they manifest themselves in the individual style of politicians, public figures and journalists in very different ways. The purpose of the paper is to identify the comic means and the functions they implement in Eu. Roizman's individual discourse. We only consider the texts produced by Eu. Roizman during his term as Mayor of Ekaterinburg. The analysis of comic techniques, their pragmatic focus, as well as the role in the politician's individual style is carried out on the texts of different genres and stylistic types by method of lexical-semantic, stylistic and discourse analysis. The authors conclude that the choice of specific types of the comic, as well as the diversity of their linguistic means and mechanisms, is conditioned by the peculiarities of the politician's individual approach to reflecting the phenomena of socio-political reality and his original manner of information presentation. The authors also stress upon the multifunctional focus of the comic used by the politician.	[Chudinov, A.

Learning Stylometric Representations for Authorship Analysis	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CYBERNETICS			English	Article						Authorship analysis (AA); computational linguistics; representation learning; text mining	ATTRIBUTION; FEATURES; LANGUAGE; STYLE	Authorship analysis (AA) is the study of unveiling the hidden properties of authors from textual data. It extracts an author's identity and sociolinguistic characteristics based on the reflected writing styles in the text. The process is essential for various areas, such as cybercrime investigation, psycholinguistics, political socialization, etc. However, most of the previous techniques critically depend on the manual feature engineering process. Consequently, the choice of feature set has been shown to be scenario-or dataset-dependent. In this paper, to mimic the human sentence composition process using a neural network approach, we propose to incorporate different categories of linguistic features into distributed representation of words in order to learn simultaneously the writing style representations based on unlabeled texts for AA. In particular, the proposed models allow topical, lexical, syntactical, and character-level feature vectors of each document to be extracted as stylometrics. We evaluate the performance of our approach on the problems of authorship characterization, authorship identification and authorship verification with the Twitter, blog, review, novel, and essay datasets. The experiments suggest that our proposed text representation outperforms the static stylometrics, dynamic n-grams, latent Dirichlet allocation, latent semantic analysis, distributed memory model of paragraph vectors, distributed bag of words version of paragraph vector, word2vec representations, and other baselines.

J	Federici, E				Federici, Eleonora			Translating the 'Other' for the Western World for more than a decade: Incredible India! campaigns	ALTRE MODERNITA-RIVISTA DI STUDI LETTERARI E CULTURALI			English	Article						tourism texts; translation; Incredible India campaigns	DESTINATION IMAGE; TOURISM; REPRESENTATIONS; PARADIGM	When we analyse and translate tourist texts promoting or dealing with non-Western destinations we certainly have to take into account the weight of postcolonial discourses in the representation of these places in the tourist field. Many ex-colonies have become popular tourist destinations, while the detritus of post-colonialism have been transformed into tourist sights, including exotic peoples and customs; artefacts; indigenous lifestyles and cultural heritage (Craik). Therefore, if tourism reinforces postcolonial relationships, tourist texts are deeply embedded in colonial discourses. Some scholars have argued that tourism is a form of "leisure imperialism" and represents "the hedonistic face of neocolonialism" (Crick 322). Hall and Tucker have dedicated a volume to the relation between postcolonial thought and tourism referring back to Edward Said's seminal work on Orientalism (1978) and to Ashcroft, Griffiths and Tiffin's The Empire Writes Back (1989), both works which outline the ontological and epistemological distinction that has been made between the Western world and the 'Other'. Encounters with the non-Western have always provided fuel for myths and mythical language and tourism has developed its own promotional lexicon and repertoire of myths (Selwyn), and as a matter of fact, otherness can be an element that makes a destination worth a visit. Studies have demonstrated how the representation of the 'Other' is closely linked to the popularization of accounts of travels and explorations in imperial lands (Pratt; Spurr), and sadly this representation is still part of tourist place promotion (Hall and Page). It is a fact that tourism plays a central role in transforming collective and individual values through ideas of commoditization (Cohen), which implies that what were once cultural displays of living traditions or cultural texts of lived authenticity become cultural products that meet the needs of commercial tourism, as well as the construction of a supposed heritage. Such a situation leads to the invention of traditions and heritage for external consumption that meet visitors' conceptions of the other (Helu-Thaman; Cronin et al.). A good example of representing a non-Western destination at an international level is the Indian campaign Incredible India launched in 2002 for the European, Asian and Middle East markets (Kant). Undertaken by the Government of India to promote India Tourism all over the world, the campaign was released by Ogilvy and Mather India in media print, internet and television. My analysis wants to outline how the main themes of the campaign (yoga, Ayurveda and other spirituality-related concepts, Indian cultures and culinary traditions and festivals all around the country, the cultural heritage and the natural resources) have been developed through time in order to 'translate' the uniqueness of India for the Western tourist in the last 15 years. The campaign Incredible India has been developed and renewed over the past few years and is still ongoing. My analysis will follow two stages: in the first I will deal with linguistic and visual techniques that create a determinate idea of India as a tourist destination, in the second I will compare texts in English with their translation into Italian, and specifically the creation of a campaign aimed at Italian tourists.

J	Gilbert, CJ				Gilbert, Christopher J.			Of Satire and Gordian Knots	STUDIES IN AMERICAN HUMOR			English	Article						comic knowledge; post-truth; truthiness; narrativity; comic judgment; political fiction		Comic dictionaries and encyclopedias are an underappreciated medium of satiric epistemology in a twenty-first century replete with televisual satire. This article looks at how the humor in texts like Jon Stewart's America (the Book) (2004) and Stephen Colbert's I Am America (And So Can You!) (2007) establishes catalogues of cultural knowledge as collections of the Gordian knots that ensnare US public culture. It argues that the written form of the dictionary or encyclopedia discloses a nexus of connections about matters of social, political, and cultural concern, which reveal grand narratives as so many bundles of squibs. The squibs enable readers to unravel the Gordian knots in hidebound modes of knowledge. Such unravelings result in a comic logic of unknowing prevailing against ways of knowing in and through narrative travesties.

The author describes how the ideas about the government changed in the new environment, especially in the new city media. As it has been mentioned above, the new course, axiology of journalism, is used for that, which, in its turn, uses the methods of linguoconceptology, particularly we speak about concepts. To conduct the conceptological analyses, we first build the usual or common-language model of the concept with the help of main Russian dictionaries, which is later compared with the discoursive one. The revealed senses are rated in accordance with the field method of concept organization (following the method of S.G. Vorkachev), because this method helps more vividly educe the most acute meanings. The discoursive analysis was conducted on the materials of Internet edition The Village as the brightest representative of the new city media. The total was 181 materials and 432 sense concepts. As the result, the author draws the conclusion that ideas about government in the discourse of the new city media came through a strong transformation: if in the usual model the meanings found are neutral or do not have any special sense colour even being connected with the ideology or a religious aspect, the front of the discoursive model contains the meanings with negative connotation.

J	Gruzdeva, MM				Gruzdeva, Margarita M.			INTERACTION OF THEATRICAL AND OTHER DISCOURSES IN MASS MEDIA (THROUGH THE EXAMPLE OF THE FUNCTIONING OF THEMATIC METAPHORS)	VESTNIK MOSKOVSKOGO UNIVERSITETA. SERIYA 10. ZHURNALISTIKA			Russian	Article						theatrical discourse; media discourse; theatrical vocabulary; thematic metaphor		The vital theme of the interaction between theatrical and other discourses (political, economic, military, criminal, sport) in contemporary Russian mass media is considered in this article through the example of the functioning of thematic metaphors. The study of the lexical aspect is important for an understanding of the processes which take place as a result of the interaction of discourses and enrich media language with new meanings and means of expression. The very concept of theatricality is not limited to theatrical art but covers various spheres of social hie. This is why the functioning of the vocabulary of theatrical discourse in other thematic varieties of media discourse is of great interest. It is also important to trace the return process of the impact of different discourses on the style and content of materials about theatre. Russian media materials in different genres are analyzed in the article demonstrating the mutual influence of theatrical and other discourses. The specificity of the functioning of thematic metaphors actualizes when the vocabulary from different discourses becomes metaphorical within the interaction. The mutual influence of theatrical and other discourses promotes the stylistic diversity of aesthetic and ethical evaluations in media texts and the perception of theatre art at a new social and political level.

I argue that Grillo's text enhances and enriches the way we may think about time and politics in the postcolonial moment, but that it may in turn also be revitalised and strengthened by speaking with and to postcolonial thought, adding it to the lexicon and strategies of displacement Grillo identifies in practices of female genital power and the matri-archive they reference.

However, little is known about how these snippets are generated or how they relate to a user's search query. Motivated by the growing body of evidence suggesting that search engine rankings can influence undecided voters, we conducted an algorithm audit of the political partisanship of Google Search snippets relative to the webpages they are extracted from. To accomplish this, we constructed lexicon of partisan cues to measure partisanship and construct a set of left- and right-leaning search queries. Then, we collected a large dataset of Search Engine Results Pages (SERPs) by running our partisan queries and their autocomplete suggestions on Google Search. After using our lexicon to score the machine-coded partisanship of snippets and webpages, we found that Google Search's snippets generally amplify partisanship, and that this effect is robust across different types of webpages, query topics, and partisan (left- and right-leaning) queries.

In this experiment, over 500 speech transcripts are scraped by building scrapers to analyze this big-data of transcripts and derive insights from it. Based on LDA topic modelling algorithm, latent "topics", referred as issues in this paper, were discovered from the speech transcripts and visualized using 'pyLDAvis', which is an interactive visualization tool used upon LDA Model results. Along with LDA, graphical visualizations were generated such as Lexical Dispersion Plots and 'Topic Bar Plots using Matplotlib library of Python. Within comparative analytics, visual graphs were generated for speeches by two different candidates and juxtaposed to compare and interpret their discourse. Linguists have performed Political Discourse Analysis (PDA) using manual approaches but analyzing such a large volume of speeches is practically time consuming and extremely complex. Our experiment which focuses on identifying socio-political issues within speech transcripts using NLP based text analytics proves to be a beneficial technique for understanding Political Discourse Analysis (PDA).

The analysis was based on van Dijk's theory on news schemata and Fairclough's and van Dijk's approaches to critical discourse analysis. The analysis has shown that the two analysed dailies, due to their different political and ideological orientations, created two different 'realities' of the same event, using different strategies in the text structure at the macro level, the selection of lexical and syntactic elements at the micro level and in the interpretation of events. This type of reporting has had a negative impact on the political scene of Montenegro on both the decisions made on the independence of the country in 2006 and the support for the NATO membership of Montenegro.

The analysis comprises 31 texts: press comments, interviews, diary excerpts and speeches. The objectives of the analysis are based on two aspects: the use of specific language resources in discourse fragments (texts) and their potential impact on readers in different contexts. The use of various language resources is analyzed at the lexical semantic and pragmatic level. The analysis shows that the political biography can be regarded as a model for the discursive profiling of politicians. The use of certain positively and negatively charged key words and phrases, pronouns and verbs creates a discursive model in which the affection of the supporters is opposed to the criticism of the opponents.

J	Maerz, SF				Maerz, Seraphine F.			Simulating pluralism: the language of democracy in hegemonic authoritarianism	POLITICAL RESEARCH EXCHANGE			English	Article						Authoritarianism; simulating pluralism; text-as-data		This article analyses the language authoritarian leaders use to legitimate their rule. It examines the official speeches of autocrats in hegemonic regimes and compares them to the rhetorical styles of leaders in closed or competitive regimes and democracies. While recent autocracy research has drawn most attention to the phenomenon of competitive authoritarianism, the survival strategies of hegemonic regimes are less explored. Thus, the study focuses on the simulation of pluralism as a key feature of hegemonic regimes. By installing non-competitive multiparty systems which merely pretend pluralism, these regimes maintain a strong grip on power. The study finds that the leaders of hegemonic regimes use a surprisingly democratic style of language to sustain this facade of pluralism. The dictionary-based quantitative text analysis of 2074 speeches of current leaders in 22 countries illustrates that compared to other autocracies, hegemonic regimes overemphasize the (non-existing) democratic procedures in their country to fake a participatory form of government and gain national and international legitimacy. The subsequent case studies of Uzbekistan, Saudi Arabia, and Russia further reveal the differences in context and motives for autocrats in hegemonic, closed, and competitive regimes to use autocratic or democratic styles of language.

Consequently, fact checking websites such as snopes.com and politifact.com are becoming popular. However, these websites require expert analysis which is slow and not scalable. Many recent works try to solve these challenges using machine learning models trained on a variety of features and a rich lexicon or more recently, deep neural networks to avoid feature engineering. In this paper, we propose hierarchical deep attention networks to learn embeddings for various latent aspects of news. Contrary to existing solutions which only apply word-level self-attention, our model jointly learns the latent aspect embeddings for classifying false claims by applying hierarchical attention. Using several manually annotated high quality datasets such as Politifact, Snopes and Fever we show that these learned aspect embeddings are strong predictors of false claims. We show that latent aspect embeddings learned from attention mechanisms improve the accuracy of false claim detection by up to 13.5% in terms of Macro F1 compared to a state-of-the-art attention mechanism guided by claim-text (DeClarE). We also extract and visualize the evidence from the external articles which supports or disproves the claims.

The material contains 30 texts from the socio-political newspaper "Rech" of the city of Cherepovets, Vologda Oblast, published during 2017 - the Year of Ecology in Russia. It is shown that the newspaper text on environmental topics has the structure of an inverted pyramid, when important information is presented at the beginning of the article, and detailing is presented in the second part; the photographs accompanying the texts have a different visual-grammatical structure and can be interpreted as one-part and two-part sentences. In the semantic aspect, it is revealed that a larger number of contextual synonymous pairs than sets are formed; gradual antonyms are used; lexical units are included that fix the anthropocentric model of the interaction of man and nature. It is identified that there is a two-way interaction between the environmental event and the text: the event is the basis for creating the text, and vice versa, a newspaper text covering an environmental problem may precede one event or another. It is indicated that the newspaper text on environmental topics is characterized by a homogeneous presentation of the material, anthropocentricity and polyphonicity; softening the presentation of problematic information is achieved through the use of literary synonyms, gradual antonyms and relevant illustrations.

The author gives examples of the third-wave American populist leaders' speeches, namely those made by Ugo Chaves, Nicolas Maduro, Evo Morales and Daniel Ortega, and reveals linguistic means of populism, as well as discursive strategies: proliferation ( lexical loading) of key concepts, such as "pueblo", "nacion", "patria" ("people", "nation", "motherland"), constructing discursive "I" in a pattern " I am my people", the use of discursive strategies of polarization that helps political leaders delegitimize the opponent and construct the para-reality to legalize and symbolize self-power. The populist discourse is marked semantically by key words pueblo, nacion, patria, special contextual coloring is designed with set expressions like la voz del pueblo ( voice of the people), by forming occasional derivatives that break language norms, by actualizing oppositions "friend-enemy", "acquaintance -stranger", "people -outsider", by applying to slogans and precedent phenomena. The participation of precedent phenomena in discursive strategies of populism is highlighted in the choice of precedent names (i.e. Simon Bolivar, Augusto Cesar Sandino, Ruben Dario), it is directed at affiliating modern political leaders with prominent leader of the past, thus pointing to national values and providing legitemisy of the politicains in power.

J	Naeem, T; Anwar, N				Naeem, Tamsila; Anwar, Nadia			Injurious Effects of Hate Speech Acts in The Bluest Eye	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGLISH LINGUISTICS			English	Article						hate speech acts; power relations; injurious effects; wounded psyche		This qualitative study aims to investigate the effects of hate speech acts of powerful agencies, which are used to establish and maintain power relations by influencing the psyche of minorities or weaker groups to assign them a subordinate position. In the light of Judith Butler's notions presented in her famous book Excitable Speech (1997) it is found that such acts are used as a linguistic weapon in the process of social domination. Hate Speech acts have an injurious effect on the psyche of the weak which prompts them to obey the commands of the speakers, the powerful. For this purpose, relevant excerpts were taken through purposive sampling technique from Toni Morrison's novel, The Bluest Eye (1970), which depicts the tragic conditions of a black family living in a race conscious society of America. They are considered inferior to the white at social, moral, economic and political levels. The analysis of the selected texts is done at both micro and macro levels. At the micro level, the lexical semantic features of the utterances are studied and at the macro level, the socio-political environment in which the black characters are victimized and then psychologically subjectified is discussed. It is seen that the feeling of being ugly has multiple and terrible influences on the mind and body of the subjects. The selected episodes from the novel are the manifestations of their wounded psyche in the white-dominated America. They unconsciously think themselves as agents of darkness, sin, crime, wickedness, immorality and evil. The findings of the study also reveal a taxonomy of newly emerging hate speech acts which may prove useful to analyze the communicative patterns of race-driven societies.

Although generating vocabulary file using dictionary and orthography have been existed for Myanmar language, the performance depends on the coverage of the dictionary and training dataset and can cause out of vocabulary (OOV) problem, leading to lower precision and recall in information retrieval. Resources are sparse for Myanmar language and it is difficult to find a comprehensive dictionary for any domain. In this paper, we propose a new method for similarity percentage measurement based automatic construction of vocabulary file, a variant of Levenshtein distance without the use of any additional data e. g., training corpus. The development of the automatic generation of vocabulary files from raw Myanmar texts to use in indexing of MIR task.

Besides, with the growth of available Arabic electronic documents and the use of this morphologically-Rich Language, especially by youth, in social networks and by companies in shopping or commercial websites (e-commerce), opinion mining in Arabic texts has become essential. Individuals and organizations are more and more interested in other people's opinion available on the web, for their decision making. Moreover, governments resort to public citizen's opinions to improve the quality of services and information offered to them. Recently, many researchers proposed approaches to detect opinions in Arabic texts, identify existing ones, extract, quantify and study their influence. So this paper provides an overview of the last update in this field and present different approaches of opinion detection in Arabic texts, so as to contribute to finding the optimal approach and discuss some of their main limitations.

These erudite lexicographical and legal texts often gave rise to slanderous statements that have also been passed on by historians who recently studied this complex figure.

In Political Science, these metadata play a significant role in studying and predicting intra- and inter-state relationships and often follows a certain structural representation. Our work exploits CAMEO (Conflict and Mediation Event Observations) ontology to extract events from political news articles. This event will be represented by metadata such as who-did-what-to-whom format. We face a number of challenges in this extraction process due to the incompleteness of CAMEO dictionaries. In particular, for some verb patterns appeared in articles we may not find an appropriate match in CAMEO verb dictionary (i.e "what"). Our goal is to recommend new verb patterns by mining a large number of news articles to enhance the existing CAMEO verb dictionaries. For this, first we apply Association Rule Mining to find frequent verb patterns. Next, to assign categories of these verb patterns, we develop a novel algorithm based on Word-to-Vec model. Finally, we develop a prototype system for automatically recommending a number of useful verb patterns.

We acknowledge the fact that knowing English is as necessary as being endowed with computer skills in almost every field of activity. With the purpose of attracting and keeping as many students as possible for the full extent of the academic year, we've introduced virtual interaction, self-study, research, and debate in the teaching process, teaching means much closer to young adults' frame of mind and to their daily activities. Our research encompasses several components of ICT, available to educators today, i.e. Moodie, Facebook, short videos, relevant to their field of study during class, virtual dictionaries and pertinent study materials such as specialized texts, trivia information and general vocabulary development exercises. Although teachers still preserve their main status as educators, our experiment emphasizes the mentoring role they also fulfill in facilitating the acquisition of English for Specific Purposes, English structure and grammar, communication strategies in virtual settings, and not only. In order to make things happen, the weekly feedback, received individually, was our students' main incentive, although it does not seem much. Students were also introduced to Summative Intelligence Concept (SiC) and Controlled Linguistic Immersion (CLI), plus Blended Learning and Flipped Classroom methods. The present paper introduces part of my ongoing PhD research, the data collected so far and computed in SPSS, displaying learners' interest towards an innovative way of teaching/learning ESP, in the specific field of their specialization. We are confident that interacting with students using new technologies, teachers' enthusiasm and determination will manage to increase students' degree of learning English as a foreign language (ESL) and their ability to effectively use it while communicating as proficient speakers, fully integrated in a genuine international working environment whose lingua franca keeps being English.

For this purpose I will present the results of my research, whose aim was to collect words of Nahuatl origin in the newspapers of Veracruz, one of the states of Mexico; and to show the importance of this type of vocabulary in Mexican Spanish. The use of indigenous words is a characteristic feature of almost all Spanish varieties spoken in America, and Mexican Spanish is no different. The vitality of the lexicon of Nahuatl origin in Mexican Spanish can be demonstrated by the fact that it has been used in journalistic texts on very different subjects: society, economy, politics, culture, gastronomy, etc. Journalistic language, as it is well-known, is a dynamic and constantly changing type of language, so the constant presence of words of Nahuatl origin there shows that this kind of vocabulary constitutes an integral part of the Spanish spoken in Mexico.

The purpose of the study is to identify the main features of the paradigm of Perestroika (common sociocultural emotions, the system of values, the "passwords" of the epoch, the set of keywords and "things", the general type of semiotic relations and "paradigm-forming" language), reflected in the work of the generation represented by meta-realists I. Zhdanov, A. Parshchikov, A. Eremenko, V. Aristov, A. Dragomoshchenko, etc.). conceptualists (D. A. Prigov, L. Rubinstein, T. Kibirov), and ironists (V. Druk, N. Iskrenko, Y. Arabov). In the study of poetic texts, the author employs corpus and linguocultural comparative analysis methods, determining the key words and concepts of the epoch of Perestroika by means of continuous sampling from specialised dictionaries. Additionally, they are singled out using the method of discourse analysis in political journalism texts. In the poetry of the 1980s-2000s, the author manages to identify reflexes of the concept of "stagnation" in the use of tautologies, and of the "bilingualism" of the Soviet time in the oppositions between "simple" and "complex", "literal" and "poetic", "superficial" and "deep", "Hell" and "Paradise", which is associated with the concept of "personal space" in the context of "unbundling" and "humanisation" characteristic of the restructuring. The article also discusses the parallels of the concept of open world, cooperation and co-creation, "glasnost" and democracy with the principles of building a poetic world and relations with the reader. As a result, the author concludes that the poetry of the 1980s-2000s is naturally incorporated into the sociocultural and linguistic paradigm of Perestroika.

J	Shackell, C; Sitbon, L				Shackell, Cameron; Sitbon, Laurianne			Computational opposition analysis using word embeddings: A method for strategising resonant informal argument	ARGUMENT & COMPUTATION			English	Article						Informal argumentation; automated persuasion; semiotics; computational opposition analysis	SEMIOTICS; LOGIC	In informal argument, an essential step is to ask what will "resonate" with a particular audience and hence persuade. Marketers, for example, may recommend a certain colour for a new soda can because it "pops" on Instagram; politicians may "fine-tune" diction for different social demographics. This paper engages the need to strategise for such resonance by offering a method for automating opposition analysis (OA), a technique from semiotics used in marketing and literary analysis to plot objects of interest on oppositional axes. Central to our computational approach is a reframing of texts as proxies for thought and opposition as the product of oscillation in thought in response to those proxies, a model to which the contextual similarity information contained in word embeddings is relevant. We illustrate our approach with an analysis of texts on gun control from ProCon.org, implementing a three-step method to: 1) identify relatively prominent signifiers; 2) rank possible opposition pairs on prominence and contextual similarity scores; and 3) derive plot values for proxies on opposition pair axes. The results are discussed in terms of strategies for informal argument that might be derived by those on each side of gun control.

J	Tang, KS				Tang, Kok-Sing			The role of language in scaffolding content & language integration in CLIL science classrooms	JOURNAL OF IMMERSION AND CONTENT-BASED LANGUAGE EDUCATION			English	Editorial Material						classroom discourse; Content Language Integrated Learning (CLIL); role of language; scientific language; scaffolding	STUDENTS	This commentary to the special issue "Teaching, Learning and Scaffolding in CLIL Science Classrooms" synthesizes the contributions from the authors by addressing two overarching questions. First, what is the role of language in mediating science teaching and learning in a CLIL science classroom? Second, to what extent can content and language be integrated or separated in CLIL instruction and assessment? In addressing the first question, I distil three major perspectives of how the authors conceive the role of language as a scaffolding tool. These roles are: (a) providing the discursive means and structure for classroom interaction to occur, (b) enabling students' construction of knowledge through cognitive and/or linguistic processes, and (c) providing the semantic relationships for science meaning-making. These three perspectives roughly correspond to the discursive, cognitive-linguistic, and semiotic roles of language respectively. In addition, two other roles - epistemic and affective, though not emphasized in this issue, are also discussed. In addressing the second question, I raise a dilemma concerning the integration of content and language. While there are clear political and theoretical arguments calling for an inseparable integration, there is also a common practice to separate content and language as distinct entities for various pedagogical and analytical purposes. In revolving this conundrum, I suggest a way forward is to consider the differences in the various roles of language (discursive/cognitive/linguistic vs. semiotic/epistemic/affective) or the levels of language involved (lexicogrammar vs. text/genre).

Translation Solutions for Sustainable Collocations of the English Political Mass Media Discourse	NAUCHNYI DIALOG			Russian	Article						(fixed) collocations; related meaning; implicit and explicit stability; structural-semantic models		The article discusses the issues of syntactic-semantic solutions of fixed collocations translation. A review of collocation samples under study has been performed; and their definition has been given. The authors undertake a comparative analysis of the collocations in the process of their translation from English into Russian. The results of the functioning of the phrases studied in the Englishlanguage political mass media texts have been presented. Particular attention is paid to such word combinations that make up the periphery of phraseology. This approach is the authors development of the topic of the collocations. It is shown that the latter have not yet fully adopted their final form of use. The authors also assume that the collocations under analysis have not yet been recorded in the dictionaries. This is the core point of the authors' development. The novelty of the study is seen in the fact that for the first time the presence of the related meaning of one of the components of such collocations is formulated. It is concluded that its direct and figurative meanings cannot but affect the translation solutions. The authors argue that the probability of borrowings and metaphorization among such word combinations is very high. The classification of models of formation of these constructions has been proposed. The relevance of the study can be explained by the difficulties of their rendering. The authors of the article offer their innovative approaches of translation solutions of mass media collocations under study.

J	Tishin, VV				Tishin, V. V.			ONCE AGAIN ON THE MEANING OF THE TERM "HORDE" AND THE CATEGORIES "GOLDEN HORDE", "WHITE HORDE", "BLUE HORDE"	ZOLOTOORDYNSKOE OBOZRENIE-GOLDEN HORDE REVIEW			Russian	Article						Jochid Ulus; Golden Horde; White Horde; Blue Horde; semantic		Research objectives: This article discusses some issues related to the problem of the relationship between the concepts of the "Golden Horde", the "White Horde", and the "Blue Horde", with an emphasis on the term "horde" itself - both as a scientific definition and as a historical concept related to the phonetic forms in which it situated in the sources. The author proposes to reveal the original meaning of the term ordo similar to orda and to outline the stages of expansion of its semantics with the delineation of semantic fields. Research materials: The article may be considered largely as a kind of commentary on the research of recent years. Since all materials on the affected issues have been known to researchers for a long time, the selection of sources looks proverbially traditional. These are Mongolic, Chinese, Latin, Muslim (Arabic and Persian), and Old Russian texts containing the word ordo in its various forms. The author did not use the whole body of sources, but rather the most illustrative materials in his opinion. Mostly, the linguistic material was employed which comprises the lexical basis for researching specific languages. Research results and novelty: In the process of researching the contexts of using of the term ordo similar to orda in various sources and different orthographic variants (corresponding to phonetic ones), the author came to the following contention. Secondary senses reflecting one of the aspects of the original sense evolved from the basic meaning recorded among thirteenth-century Mongols - "the abiding-place of a ruler, his family, his entourage, and all the attendants". Since the development took place in parallel, this did not exclude the words being used with different intended meanings in the same texts, which can be revealed only as a result of the analysis of the context. The contexts of the use of the term in the sources make it possible to assert that there was a process of expansion of the term's original meaning, reflected in the perception of different authors being representatives of foreign cultures. This occurs in the period after the middle of the fourteenth century, being directly caused by the events of political history of the Jochid ulus as it was plunged into an era of trouble. Also, the emergence of additional senses associated with the concept of territory was the result of a comprehension of the word in related contexts within the worldview specific for sedentary cultures. The author of the article accepts the point to identity the terms "Golden Horde" and "White Horde", both contrasted with the concept "Blue Horde", originally associated respectively with the designation of the domains of the descendants of Batu in the western part, and the descendants of Urdu in the eastern part, of the Jochid ulus. In addition, it is recognized that the hypothesis on the correlation of these color markers with the traditional geosymbolism of the Turkic and Mongolian peoples is not sufficiently substantiated although it is theoretically permissible. The fact that the term ordo similar to orda with both color markers of "gold" and "white" was more often associated with the sense "qan's tent", corresponds with the source data on similar epithets for tents of different qans. Historically, the possession of such tent was typical for certain leaders, at least in the Mongolian tradition, but from an early age it had come to be claimed as the attribute of the rulers of the Jochid ulus primarily. Nonetheless, a solid identification of the relationship between the concepts "golden" and "white" requires special research.	[Tishin, V.

THE LINGUISTIC ASPECT OF THE PROBLEM	SOCIAL AND CULTURAL TRANSFORMATIONS IN THE CONTEXT OF MODERN GLOBALISM (SCTCGM 2018)	European Proceedings of Social and Behavioural Sciences		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Social and Cultural Transformations in the Context of Modern Globalism (SCTCGM)	NOV 01-03, 2018	Russian Acad Sci, Complex Res Inst Kh I Ibragimov, Groznyi, RUSSIA		Russian Acad Sci, Complex Res Inst Kh I Ibragimov	Russian mentality; European identity; linguistic mental structures; cognitive linguistics; political linguistics; lexical-semantic field		The article presents the results of linguocognitive reconstruction of lexical-semantic fields "Russian mentality" and "European identity". The linguistic material is taken from the humanitarian scientific texts. The analysis was made on the base of those words and phrases which constitute the nuclear parts only. The research is carried out in the framework of cognitive linguistics and is based on constructing semantic fields in combination with the lexical-semantic and cognitive-discursive analysis. It is proved that the composition of the fields differs in structural-grammatical and content relations. The field "Russian mentality" in the nuclear part consists of key lexemes, their list can be made according to different criteria. So, the axiological approach within the secular projection gives the lexemes truth, goodness, beauty, while the axiological approach in the Christian projection gives the triad faith, hope, love. The linguacultural approach results, first, in dyads: the veracity and the truth, fate and freedom, and second, the triads will, courage, heroism and collectivism, collegiality, devotion. The field "European identity" in the nuclear part consists of attributive or object-attributive word combinations with the noun identity as the main or dependent word. The attributive phrases reflect, firstly, the particular aspects of the identity of the peoples and states that make up the European Union, and secondly, the integral aspect of European identity, which is fixed by generic definitions of European. They are specified in two subgroups: "national dimension": post-national, transnational, international, supranational; "state aspect": civil, all-civil, state, constitutional. The integral characteristic of European identity is hybrid and multiple. (C) 2019 Published by Future Academy www.FutureAcademy.org.UK	[Volkov, V. V.; Volkova, N. V.; Gladilina, I.

The authors of the paper explore the methods of fulfilling the principle of political correctness at the lexico-semantic level in the texts of modern English-speaking media publications, dealing with the topic of disability and limited human health. The authors highlight current trends in this discourse: rethinking the concept of disability ("disability / HVD") as a new identity, using the vocabulary that implies overcoming human health limitations in naming the groups of people with disabilities, using the lexical unit special needs in the educational context exclusively. The texts of articles written in English feature a large number of euphemisms because of their traumatic subject. The authors propose their classification, including a new category of naming people with disabilities, based on mentioning the appropriate ways of how they overcome their challenges. Variants of translating politically correct vocabulary from English into Russian are proposed to reflect its specificity. The linguistic aspect of this research is to make a positive contribution into the concept of equal rights of people with disabilities and those with no impairments.	[Vorontsova, I.

RUSSIAN NAME-GIVING OF THE NEW TIME: SOCIO-CULTURAL AND POLITICAL IDEOLOGICAL MECHANISMS OF ANTHROPONYMIC SHIFTS	VOPROSY ONOMASTIKI-PROBLEMS OF ONOMASTICS			Russian	Article						Russian name giving; causes of anthroponymic shifts; Europeization; archaization; New Time; cultural paradigm; identity		The author stems from the premise that modern anthroponymy effectively incorporates data from related fields of knowledge, primarily those of cultural and political history, thus getting enlarged through interdisciplinary research. An integrated approach allows one to deduce the extra-linguistic mechanisms which lay behind anthroponymic changes. In the same vein, the present paper focuses on the dynamics within the Russian anthroponymic paradigm caused by the changing vectors of political, ideological, cultural, and religious identity in the historical perspective of the New Time (1700-1920s). The study aims to establish the connection between specific trends in naming and the precedent names, events, and texts of political, cultural, and religious life. The mechanisms of anthroponymic shifts are illustrated by the cases of individual names becoming socially significant in a particular historical context. Using interdisciplinary methods of cultural anthropology, the study builds on textual sources, primarily name indexes to the collections of works by outstanding cultural figures and scholars, and biographical dictionaries. Some examples of pragmatic naming strategies in works of art (literature, opera, cinema) are also provided. Preliminary findings reveal some major trends in the Russian anthroponymic system of the New Age such as Europeization vs. Russification, modernization vs. archaization, as well as their synthesis. These tendencies remain key up to the present day and can be traced and characteristically defined within a set (or corpus) of names relating to the particular epoch, in terms of their frequency and the parameters of the sociolinguistic distribution. The diachronic perspective of the study also supports the sociolinguistic observation that the newly introduced names, which are currently in use, have a pronounced social resonance, which is getting neutralized as their frequency increases. Further development of the topic implies, among other things, statistical verification of preliminary findings.

To classify the proposals, that is to say, to determine the subject words is the primary task of handling the proposals. In this paper, TextCNN is used to pre-classify the subject words of proposals in order to assist in the final determination of the subject words manually. According to the text characteristics of the proposal, a professional dictionary and a special stop dictionary for uncommon words are first established. The text is trained as vectors through Worol2dev and used as input of TextCNN neural network High-level features are extracted by convolution layer, dimensionality reduction by pooling layer, feature integration by full connection layer and multi classification by softmax layer. The open source deep learning framework TensorFlow is used to realize the base. The training and design of E-government text categorization algorithm based on in-depth learning, the structure of deep convolution neural network model and the optimization of model parameters are designed and saved. The experimental results show that the accuracy is improved by 3% compared with the relative entropy classification algorithm used in the previous system. At the same time, the training model is used to restore and predict the classification in the actual system, which reduces the computational pressure of the server.

However, most existing methods only extract hand-crafted features, far from adequate in interpreting semantics latent in texts. For social events, there also exists rich social contextual information and high-level interactions among significant features, which provides cues for interpreting semantics. In this paper, we propose a novel attention learning framework via deep visual perception based recurrent neural network (ViP-RNN), considering both high-level feature interactions and contextual information. In particular, the proposed model is based on RNN for capturing the long-distance temporal dependencies of contextual information of relevant posts and composing low-level lexical features into high-level semantic interactions hierarchically by visual perception of convolutional neural network (CNN). To incorporate information learned by RNN and CNN, we combine convolutional and recurrent layers into one model so that the model can capture a discriminative semantic representation of social events more efficiently by utilizing visual perception attention vector i.e. outputs of CNN to align long-distance temporal dependencies. We conduct experiments on real datasets collected from social media websites, which demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach and the merits of model integration.

J	Zeltchenko, VV				Zeltchenko, Vsevolod V.			Philogelos 63 and the Meaning of	PHILOLOGIA CLASSICA			English	Article						Philogelos; gestatio; Ancient Greek lexicology; Ancient Greek lexicography		In an unassuming story 63 from the Philogelos collection, a one-eyed governor goes , praising to his companion "the grapevines on the left side (of the road)". A set of attested meanings of / (literally, 'a hanging', 'swinging') does not suit the context. The story is extant only in a longer variant of the collection; its first editor, J. F. Boissonade (1848), supposed that a in this context means `grapes suspended from trees'. The successive commentators and translators, having accepted his idea, understand it as 'a vineyard'; meanwhile, the Greek lexicons, from LSJ to F. Montanari, have ignored both Boissonade's interpretation and the passage itself. The article stresses that Boissonade profited from an unmentioned gloss of G. Wakefield, surviving in the London (1821) and Parisian (1831) revisions of Thesaurus Graecae Linguae of Henri Estienne, as well as from the glossed passage Suda a. 261 Adler itself (a schoolroom interpolation in the text of Babr. 19). While in Ps.-Babrius the word is used in its common meaning ('something hanging'), in the context of Philog. 63 one expects rather a statement of the purpose of the governor's outing: the words "when he went out into the vineyard", lacking any explanation whatever, make an ex abrupto beginning. Dismissing the interpretation of Boissonade, the author draws attention to the fact that in writers of the 5-6th c. (Malal. Chron. II, 8; V, 3 Thurn; cf. Hesych. epsilon 7751 Latte) and (Ioseph. Hypomn. 46) are attested in the meanings 'to take a walk' and 'a walk' resp.; the same meaning should be supposed for in Philog. 63. In all probability, the semantic shift from 'swinging' to 'walking' was prompted by the usage in the Empire of as equivalents to the Latin gestatio - a therapeutic practice of a mild agitation of the patient's body (be it in a carriage, a litter, on board a ship, or in a hammock). Medical prescriptions of doctors and literary works of their clients alike mention gestatio alongside walking, which may have contributed to a broadening of respective units.

J	Antoniou, M				Antoniou, Maria			Cultural Ethos Constructed in Press Titles and Their Translation: The Case of Political Discourse	ROMANIAN JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATION AND PUBLIC RELATIONS			English	Article						Politeness; Pragmatics; Intercultural Communication; Cultural Ethos; Headlines; Greek		The present study explores, from a contrastive point of view, the conditions that rule the political discourse in terms of linguistic politeness. By contrasting the data (examples drawn from press titles, mainly the French journal Le Monde Diplomatique and its' translations into Greek), we will be able to discover the underlying operations and constraints that regulate the use of such markers and to reach conclusions about the existence or not of symmetrical uses of our two languages. The theoretical framework followed is that of Brown and Levinson and the one of the Theory of Enunciation. In the case of press titles translation, despite the possibility of using symmetrical structures in source text as well as in target text, different structures are mostly preferred. This discrepancy leads to hypothesis about different linguistic attitudes of each linguistic community reflected explicitly by the use of different syntactic/lexical markers. It is this awareness that enabled Brown and Levinson (1987: 248) to consider cross-cultural variation and recognise that some societies may be oriented towards one or the other type of politeness (i.e. negative or positive)", formulating the so called cultural ethos of each linguistic community.

J	Demeshkina, TA				Demeshkina, T. A.			"EXILE" AS A PHENOMENON OF THE SIBERIAN LINGUACULTURE	VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA FILOLOGIYA-TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF PHILOLOGY			Russian	Article						dialect; concept; discourse; script; discursive variation	REPRESENTATION	The subject of the analysis in the article is the specificity of the formation of the Siberian concept sphere on the example of the concept "exile" that is considered as a phenomenon of the Siberian linguaculture manifested at the communicative level. The main body of texts for analysis were oral stories of Russian old-timers, speakers of the Middle Ob dialect, about the period of "peasant" exile (1930s-1950s). Texts of official documents, fragments of poetic texts were used for comparison. The concept "exile" occupies a significant place in the Siberian linguaculture. It is characterised by temporal length, regionality, social and evaluative meanings; it has communicative markers. In Siberian discourse, the concept is verbalised by a large number of lexical units belonging to different lexical semantic groups. For instance, the Siberians use different names for exiled people (poselenets [settler], spetspereselenets [special settler], posel'ga (dialectal) [settler], politssyl'nyy [political exile], etc.). The main speech genres of oral communication, in which the concept "exile" is represented, are recollection and autobiographical narrative. The mental structure of the concept varies in different discursive practices. In personality-oriented discourse, procedural signs are actualised in the speech of the exiles; in the speech of the indigenous people, perception and evaluation are in the communicative focus; in official documents, the activity and evaluation components are represented based on respect for the rule of law. Evaluation is actualised in all types of texts, but differs by authors depending on the value system that one considers true. The value dominants of communicants lie in the ethical and social spheres, and are associated with the actualisation of the meanings of justice - injustice, good - evil, punishment - crime, man - power, and others. The discrepancy between the values of different social groups leads to a mismatch of discursive linguistic pictures of the world. The linguoculturological potential of the concept "exile" is manifested in its ability to form the figurative pool of the language, to enter the small genres of Siberian folklore, to receive literary expression in the works of Siberian writers and poets who were participants and witnesses of the dramatic period of Russian history.

The economic effects of US presidential tax communication: Evidence from a correlated topic model	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY			English	Article						Tax policy; US president; News; Sentiment; Topic models	GOVERNMENT; NEWS; CONFIDENCE; COVERAGE; IMPACT; MEDIA; TEXT	We combine a probabilistic topic model and a dictionary-based sentiment analysis to construct a time series, which indicates when and how (positive vs. negative) the U.S. president communicates his tax policy news to the public. The econometric analyses show that optimistic tax policy statements stimulate consumption, investment, and output, even after controlling for tax foresight. We also find that consumer sentiment reacts positively to more optimistic tax news, suggesting that sentiment plays an important role in the transmission from U.S. presidential tax policy communication to economic activity.

J	Shirokikh, A				Shirokikh, Anna			Glossary Compilation: Cultural Implications, Learners' Autonomy, Mnemonics, Professional Development and Motivation	MODERN JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE TEACHING METHODS			English	Article						Glossary; Terminology; Cultural Awareness; Professionalization; Translation; Mnemonics		The aim of the paper is to find out how techniques and strategies used in glossary compilation process can enhance learners' verbal performance and professional knowledge. The assumption is that there is some interdependence between increased attention to cultural elements in terminology, the levels of students' motivation, professional knowledge and memorization rate. Code switching, practiced by professionals in subject-specific discourses, hampers the pace of learning a language. The empirical material for this research is terminology for finance, investigated on the subject of its cultural peculiarities in mass media and academic texts. A list of culturally biased elements in terminology for finance probably includes proper names, abbreviations, contextual usage, metaphors, connotations, etymological implications, the range of synonyms and international words. Empirical evidence, collected by students of finance during their course of ESP studies, is presented in the form of quantitative and qualitative analyses. The rationale for the didactic approach to glossary compilation includes the concept of learners' autonomy, i.e. the exposure to more self-governing tasks. A model for glossary compilation activities is worked out and a lexicographic pattern for subject-specific thematic vocabulary is suggested. It includes traditional glossary entries, such as definitions, translations, contexts, and more novel ideas for terminological research, e.g. etymological comparisons, cross-cultural commentary or inter-domain usage of words. The tasks based on the glossary contents include controlled practice and freer activities. Students may prepare these tasks on their own, thus, glossary compilation process presents a mode of autonomic work. The author overviews the results of a survey, where students state that glossary compilation activities have helped them to memorize terms better, develop professionally, become more autonomous, motivated and culturally aware learners.

The Process of Creating Myths About Russian Federation In English-Language Online Mass Media	MODERN JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE TEACHING METHODS			English	Article						journalism; mass media; manipulation; myths; Russia; Kremlin; public opinion; online media		The current paper is dedicated to studying the mechanisms of manipulation and propaganda in English-language mass media, with a focus on the process of creating myths about Russia through news articles in the Online media. The main goal of the study was to identify the general dynamics of representation of Russia in the international mass media, determine the characteristic of stereotyping and myth-making, analyze the methods of creating the image of the country. We have studied the articles of "Middle East Eye", an independent media source led "by events, not political leaning" [1], and "Spiegel Online International", an online version of a German media translated into the English language [2]. Through the methods of content analysis of media articles (quantitative and qualitative), monitoring of the content representing Russia, structural analysis of the content, lexico-stylistic analysis, comparative analysis it had been ascertained that during the period of the research, the studied mass media tended to create negative images of Russia with great frequency, use labeling and mythmaking methods in their articles to present the country and its key personalities as enemies. Current study covers journalistic texts published during the period from the beginning of 2015 year to the May, 2018, which made it possible to see the dynamics of the myths about Russia and determine how the tone and volume of coverage of the country transform through this period under political, economic, social events across the world.

J	Stewart, J				Stewart, Jemma			Blooming Marvel: The Garlic Flower in Bram Stoker's Hermeneutic Garden	GOTHIC STUDIES			English	Article						Floriography; Garlic; Dracula	DRACULA	This article explores the use of floral symbolism within Gothic fiction of the fin de siecle. Taking as a basis the language of flower anthologies popularised throughout the nineteenth century, it investigates how this notoriously unstable floral language filtered through into the popular Gothic fiction at the end of the century. Whilst authors of Gothic may have adhered to existing codes and associations pertaining to particular flowers, they also destabilised traditional meaning, and introduced a new floral lexicon into the popular imagination. The article primarily considers Bram Stoker's Dracula in an attempt to locate floral significance through consideration of the production and widely discussed political agenda of the text. Through a close reading of Dracula's garlic flower, the article asks whether there might be a Gothic language of flowers situated within the narrative that bears comparison with other Gothic fictions of the period and beyond.

Rubesh; Bhaskar, Vidhyacharan			Big data analytics for disaster response and recovery through sentiment analysis	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFORMATION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Big data; Disaster management; Natural language processing; Sentiment analysis; Text classification; Social media analysis	SOCIAL MEDIA; TWITTER; SUPPORT; CLASSIFICATION; SYSTEM	Big data created by social media and mobile networks provide an exceptional opportunity to mine valuable insights from them. This information is harnessed by business entities to measure the level of customer satisfaction but its application in disaster response is still in its inflection point. Social networks are increasingly used for emergency communications and help related requests. During disaster situations, such emergency requests need to be mined from the pool of big data for providing timely help. Though government organizations and emergency responders work together through their respective national disaster response framework, the sentiment of the affected people during and after the disaster determines the success of the disaster response and recovery process. In this paper, we propose a big data driven approach for disaster response through sentiment analysis. The proposed model collects disaster data from social networks and categorize them according to the needs of the affected people. The categorized disaster data are classified through machine learning algorithm for analyzing the sentiment of the people. Various features like, parts of speech and lexicon are analyzed to identify the best classification strategy for disaster data. The results show that lexicon based approach is suitable for analyzing the needs of the people during disaster. The practical implication of the proposed methodology is the real- time categorization and classification of social media big data for disaster response and recovery. This analysis helps the emergency responders and rescue personnel to develop better strategies for effective information management of the rapidly changing disaster environment.	[Ragini, J.

We describe the methodology and tools that were required for their construction. The corpora contain more than 250,000 documents with political, business, economic and financial content from five Slovene media resources on the web. More than 10,000 of them were manually annotated as negative, neutral or positive. All corpora are publicly available under a Creative Commons copyright license. We used the annotated documents to construct a Slovene sentiment lexicon, which is the first of its kind for Slovene, and to assess the sentiment classification approaches used. The constructed corpora were also utilised to monitor within-the-document sentiment dynamics, its changes over time and relations with news topics. We show that sentiment is, on average, more explicit at the beginning of documents, and it loses sharpness towards the end of documents.

LEXICAL ORGANIZATION OF THE RECORD IN A DISCURSIVE ASPECT (ON THE BASIS OF RECORDS OF 1918-1933)	TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL			Russian	Article						document discourse; record; lexical organization of discourse; discursive parameters; content analysis; historical and cultural context		The aim of the work is to reveal the quantitative characteristics of the lexical organization of the text of the record in the aspect of reflecting historical events that took place in Tomsk in the post-revolutionary period (1918-1933). Despite its significant role in providing of official communications, the documentary text has occupied attention of linguists since not so long ago. As part of traditional research directions, functional classification of texts has been carried out, general design parameters have been revealed, basic properties have been described. At the same time, texts show tendencies that are contrary to the properties described, which has prompted the emergence of new research projects within the framework of discursive and cognitive directions. In this connection, a special interest is the study of documentary discourse in the historical aspect, since works in this direction are few. Discourse analysis is accepted as the leading methodological approach in the work. The main method is automated content analysis, which allowed to reveal the quantitative aspect of the lexical organization of documents. The material of the analysis is an array of texts of records / extracts from records from the collections of documents of the State Archive of Tomsk Oblast (subseries "People and Power") from 1918 to 1933, which includes 126 documents. The total number of word forms in these documents is more than 40,000. The research revealed that the record, as a documentary genre, fully fulfills the "witness" function, reflecting the social context in which it is created. The analysis of quantitative parameters established that the array of records of meetings of various authorities of Tomsk Province dated by 1918-1933 meets the requirements for documentary discourse in general: (1) the most frequent are document markers in accordance with the requirement of factography: anthroponyms, toponyms and the designation of dates; (2) the texts correspond to the requirement of unification - the most frequent are lexical units denoting the type of document, situations, typical communicative actions, typical participants and locus. In other words, the texts under study refer to the sphere of institutional communication. However, the revealed parameters show the influence of the social context: (1) male names dominate in the texts, which indicates an obvious gender imbalance in the society of the period under study; (2) surnames that function in the texts of the records allow to identify socially and politically important figures relevant to the region; (3) the most frequent lexical units reflect the main events that are significant for the social and political life of the province; (4) estimation of the dynamics of the vocabulary of the records arranged by years allows to identify the relationship between political and social processes of national and regional nature; 5) lexical units have been revealed that mark the establishment of a new type of social relations and, ultimately, denote the boundaries of the time period for the development of documentary discourse as a whole.

Since then a handful of texts have sought to further describe and explore the notion, moving beyond the initial definition given by the Oxford Dictionary. This article rejects the term 'post-truth', in favour of propaganda, since post-truth tends to be utilized as an evaluative term of contemporary political public discourse, as articulated by specific politicians, predominantly through social media. Taking the field of information management as its starting point, our approach underlines the diachronic character of persuasion efforts through information management, understood as propaganda in the public sphere. As a notion, propaganda, in contrast to post-truth, encapsulates both the diachronic character of information management in the public sphere and the ground-breaking transformation of the process of personal opinion expression, initially described by the spiral of silence model, through the emergence of new interactive media.

J	Bulgakova, NO; Sedelnikova, OV				Bulgakova, Natalia O.; Sedelnikova, Olga, V			THE SPHERE OF CONCEPTS OF THE NOVEL DEMONS BY FYODOR DOSTOEVSKY: ON REVEALING THE MAIN CONCEPT AND ITS FUNCTION IN THE POETICS OF THE BOOK	VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA FILOLOGIYA-TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF PHILOLOGY			Russian	Article						Fyodor Dostoevsky; novel Demons; literary concept; besovstvo; poetics; plot; composition; system of characters		The article is devoted to the revealing of the main concept of the novel Demons by Fyodor Dostoevsky, analysis of its functions in the sense field organization and poetics of the book. The concept "besovstvo" [devildom] became relevant for the writer in the light of the socio-political situation in Russia in the 1860s. In his interpretation, it was the reason of the moral crisis concerning all the social strata. The analysis of the materials that characterize the history of the Demons creation in its connection with the poetics of the title and the epigraphs showed that the main concept of the novel is "besovstvo". The identification of all the fragments with the nuclear lexical items of the nominal field of the concept "besovstvo" shows that three of them are verbalized in the chronicler's speech, sixteen in the characters' words. In the chronicler's speech, the features disease, fury, pride point at the deformation of the moral values. In the characters' speech (Stavrogin and Dasha, Tikhon, Stepan Trofimovich, etc.), the concept is verbalized in a more detailed way. In these fragments the features logic, infidelity, contempt, pride, helplessness revealing the reasons of the moral destruction as well as disgust and fear proving the pernicious character of this phenomenon are verbalized. The functions of the chosen fragments in the development of the narrative, composition and character structure of the novel were determined, which helped establish that the concept "besovstvo" has a key role in the poetics of the book. It unites separate stories proving the large scale of the crisis. The concept "besovtvo" determines the specificity of the plot: fragments where it is verbalized with key words have a reflective character and actualize the philosophical content of the book. In the exposition, the concept verbalization reveals the disharmony of the characters' personalities and the town life. The concept representation is more active in the second and the third parts of the book. The chapter "At Tikhon's", highlighting the tragedy of the main hero, is of particular importance. The concept is entirely actualized in Stepan Trofimovich's speech on besovstvo that covered Russia. The Apocalypse motive that is emphasized here determines the destruction of social and moral values that regulate the characters' life. The concept actualization helps to create the system of characters, in which Stavrogin is the center. Consequently, the concept "besovstvo" in the novel Demons represents the author's view on the social and moral problems of his time, reveals the manifestation and reasons of the deep crisis that the Russian society was going through. It also unifies all the levels of the novel's poetics, determines its narrative, composition and character structure, provides the unity of the literary text.

The use of politeness in WhatsApp discourse and move 'requests'	JOURNAL OF PRAGMATICS			English	Article						WhatsApp; Politeness strategies; Requests; Openings; Closings	STUDENTS; EMOTICONS; SPEAKERS; FACEBOOK; EMAIL	WhatsApp provides the opportunity to send and receive text, audio recordings and messages with visual content. To our knowledge, there are no linguistic guidelines for writing WhatsApp messages and people may often be unsure about which politeness strategies and forms of language are appropriate for a specific occasion. This study addresses WhatsApp communication among native speakers of Spanish in Mexico and presents an analysis of a total of 82 WhatsApp messages containing requests sent by 60 native speakers of Spanish who were members of two different groups. The researchers examined verbal means of expressing politeness in the forms of address, opening and closing formulae, the degree of directness, and the amount of syntactic, lexical/phrasal and external modification used in the WhatsApp requests employed by Mexican Spanish speakers. The analysis focused on politeness strategy selection, with the findings obtained showing that people use conventionally indirect strategies and a great deal of syntactic modification. Opening and closing sequences occurred in all of the interactions analyzed. Greetings were preferred over deferential forms of address that could indicate a way of showing solidarity between interactants. The results were examined based on Watts' (2003) concepts of politic behavior and politeness to highlight the pragmalinguistic characteristics of the WhatsApp requests employed by Mexican Spanish users.

J	Hamdi, A; Shaban, K; Zainal, A				Hamdi, Ali; Shaban, Khaled; Zainal, Anazida			CLASENTI: A Class-Specific Sentiment Analysis Framework	ACM TRANSACTIONS ON ASIAN AND LOW-RESOURCE LANGUAGE INFORMATION PROCESSING			English	Article						Sentiment analysis; opinion mining; Arabic language processing; text mining	IMBALANCED DATA; CLASSIFICATION; SUBJECTIVITY; SMOTE	Arabic text sentiment analysis suffers from low accuracy due to Arabic-specific challenges (e.g., limited resources, morphological complexity, and dialects) and general linguistic issues (e.g., fuzziness, implicit sentiment, sarcasm, and spam). The limited resources problem requires efforts to build new and improved Arabic corpora and lexica. We propose a class-specific sentiment analysis (CLASENTI) framework. The framework includes a new annotation approach to build multi-faceted Arabic corpus and lexicon allowing for simultaneous annotation of different facets, including domains, dialects, linguistic issues, and polarity strengths. Each of these facets has multiple classes (e.g., the nine classes representing dialects found in the Arab world). The new corpus and lexicon annotations facilitate the development of new class-specific classification models and polarity strength calculation. For the new sentiment classification models, we propose a hybrid model combining corpus-based and lexicon-based models. The corpus-based model has two interrelated phases to build; (1) full-corpus classification models for all facets; and (2) class-specific models trained on filtered subsets of the corpus according to the performances of the full-corpus models. To calculate polarity strengths, the lexicon-based model filters the annotated lexicon based on the specific classes of the domain and dialect. As a case study, we collect and annotate 15274 reviews from various sources, including surveys, Facebook comments, and Twitter posts, pertaining to governmental services. In addition, we develop a new web-based application to apply the proposed framework on the case study. CLASENTI framework reaches up to 95% accuracy and 93% F1-Score surpassing the best-known sentiment classifiers implemented in Scikit-learn library that achieve 82% accuracy and 81% F1-Score for Arabic when tested on the same dataset.

The cycle is constructed from variations on the images and motifs of predecessors, both poets and musicians, including Aleksandr Pushkin, Vasilii Zhukovskii, Apollon Maikov, Aleksandr Blok, and Petr Tchaikovskii and his Children's Album. This analysis of the text - at the level of its lexical, rhythmic and syntactic features demonstrates the profound convergence of music and poetry, the interweaving of literary and musical allusions, and the inclusion of contemporary experience into the course of history as basis for the creative transformation of the world in Pasternak's poetics. With this analysis, we demonstrate why and how lyrical poetry functions as a key source for the reconstruction of the poet's political, cultural-historical, conceptual, and spiritual views.

NETWORKING OF ETHNIC MOBILIZATION: EXPLORING THE ROLE OF APPEALS IN INTERETHNIC CONFLICTS	TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL			Russian	Article						appeal; mobilization; ethnic conflict; Twitter; intention; intent analysis		The article aims to identify the mobilizing role of propaganda tools in the online space in the unfolding ethnopolitical conflicts. Ethnic conflicts are the subject of close society's attention and scientists' research. Within the framework of the study of ethnopolitical mobilization, the analysis of appeals (as incitement) becomes one of the methods that contribute to the consolidation of various social actors. Over the past decades, various approaches to the study of appeals in the so-called offline space have been developed. The current situation forces us to shift the focus of research to the Internet environment. The subject of the study were calls and appeals in the social network Twitter related to the two most resonant interethnic confrontations in modern Russian history - the pogroms in Biryulyovo (2013) and the so-called "The nanny Bobokulova's Case " (2016). The research tools were the methods developed for the analysis of texts in juridical linguistics, primarily to identify calls in the general array of text units. Identified lexical units were subjected to intent-analysis to clarify their semantic content and direction, the formed image of the enemy. At the same time, an attempt was made to reveal the level of aggression of intentions. To correlate communicative messages on the Internet with real events, the case-study method was used. The result of the study was a multi-stage analysis of more than 3,000 appeals in the social network Twitter, which allowed to reveal the tendency of the enemy image formation in the mass consciousness, to understand who is guilty in the public consciousness. According to the participants of the network discourse, responsibility for what happened lies on labor migrants, representatives of another ethnos, and specific political actors. The trend of generalization of the enemy is traced, when mostly negative characteristics of a single representative of an alien ethnic community are extrapolated to the whole of this community. In addition, the bulk of appeals are of a reflective, reactive character, and the requirements articulated in them are mostly blurred. Nevertheless, calls as one of the propaganda methods have already proved their effectiveness in the offline space, and therefore deserve further serious study in social networks. The study of appeals, along with other propaganda methods and techniques, helps to reveal the intentions of participants in interethnic confrontations and, accordingly, to develop countermeasures for the prevention of open social conflicts.

To obtain data as homogeneous as possible we focus on three adverbs outside morphological paradigms, namely, heut(e) 'today', gern(e) 'willingly', and bald(e) 'soon', in one particular text type, the letters written by one and the same person, the writer Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (1749-1832). Apart from lexical differences between the items studied and change over time, various phonological factors are shown to be important, most prominently the accent pattern of the following word (schwa tends to be present if the first syllable of the following word is accentuated), foot structure, and the initial segment of the following word. Statistical analyses, both for the individual factors and their (potential) interactions, reveal significant patterns at work behind the variation. For gern(e) the most important factors are purely phonological while for heut(e) the type of the following boundary and the position in the sentence is crucial.

J	Hart, C				Hart, Christopher			Event-Frames Affect Blame Assignment and Perception of Aggression in Discourse on Political Protests: An Experimental Case Study in Critical Discourse Analysis	APPLIED LINGUISTICS			English	Article							COGNITIVE-LINGUISTIC APPROACH; MEDIA DISCOURSE; PRESS; NEWS; OPINION; BAD	While critical discourse analysis (CDA) is largely an interpretative exercise, it places an emphasis on 'triangulation' as a guiding methodological principle intended to help ground analyses and guard against purely subjective readings of texts. Missing from CDA, however, is triangulation incorporating experimental methodologies. In this paper, I argue that CDA in general can benefit from an experimental dimension and that cognitive linguistic approaches in particular lend themselves to extension into experimentalism. I demonstrate this by reporting a recent experiment carried out within a cognitive linguistic framework on the effects of regular transactive versus reciprocal verbs in news reports of political protests. Results of the experiment show that in the context of media discourse on political protests, the presentation of these alternative constructions, as well as differences in information sequence, affect how people apportion blame and the level of aggression they perceive in social actors. The experiment thus not only provides evidence for the ideological effects of these particular linguistic differences but more generally goes some way to justifying CDA's focus on micro-level lexico-grammatical features of texts.

J	Maximova, OB				Maximova, Olga B.			Russia's Portrayal in the Mirror of International Mass Media: The Role of Cultural Context	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGLISH LINGUISTICS			English	Article						cultural context; cultural representation; political discourse; mass media; culture-bound elements; background knowledge; linguo-cultural analysis; discourse analysis; Russia's image	DISCOURSE; CONSTRUCTION	The analysis of cultural context in media texts can contribute to understanding how national images are constucted in the international media discourse. The image of a country is better understood by the audience of another country when it is introduced through familiar cultural concepts and well-known experiences so that specific, culture-bound elements of the other culture are brought closer to the target audience. The research provides linguo-cultural analysis of Russia's portrayal in political media discourse in English-speaking countries drawing on the approach to political discourse as the process of production and interpretation of a text in meaningful political, social and cultural context. The study is aimed at exploring British and U.S.A. mass media to reveal typical features of the English-language political discourse concerning Russia and to find out how Russia's image is constmcted. In the course of the study we examined culture-bound lexicon in texts of various genres of political discourse in mass media focusing on Russia. Further, the use of Russian culture-bound items without translation in British and American mass media was analyzed, and such items were classified into categories according to their contextual functions. The results indicate that Russia is deeply integrated into the cultural context of the English-speaking audience; it can be said that Russia's image in the Anglophone political media discourse is outlined with the aid of various cultural-bound associative, connotative and metaphorical links which are familiar for native readers and serve them as a bridge facilitating their understanding and interpretation of Russian culture.

J	Hou, ZD				Hou, Zhide			The American Dream meets the Chinese Dream: a corpus-driven phraseological analysis of news texts	TEXT & TALK			English	Article						the American dream; the Chinese Dream; corpus; media representations; semantic preference; semantic prosody		This study is a corpus-driven examination of frequent lexical words and keywords in the news texts related to the American Dream and the Chinese Dream. Based on Sinclair's (Sinclair, John McHardy. 2004. Trust the Text. Routledge: London) five categories of co-selection as framework, it discusses the patterns of co-selection across the corpora of news texts, with a particular focus on the cumulative effects of the co-construction of situated meanings and establishment of ideological positions associated with the two dreams. The corpus linguistic tool Wordsmith is used to generate frequent words and keywords for detailed concordance analysis along both syntagmatic and paradigmatic relations in order to indicate collocation, colligation, semantic preference, and semantic prosody. The findings demonstrate the individualistic home, work and education associations of the American Dream versus the collectivistic attributions of the Chinese Dream of national rejuvenation. The study not only confirms different cultural practices, but also reveals different social-historical conditions, and political influences associated with media representations of the American Dream and the Chinese Dream.

Through a variety of printed texts from the late eighteenth to the early nineteenth-century -apologies, praises, dictionaries and other literary texts- and through a methodology that unites the cultural history and concepts, the focus will be on how the eighteenth-century cultural elites attributed a positive and necessary meaning to the concept to build discourses on what happened in 1492. Dismantling its ideological dimension allows understanding "impartiality" as a constructive tool to "difference", a notion that legitimates and grants prestige to the Spanish nation as well as structures a complex network of identities.

STATUTORY INTERPRETATION ON THE BENCH: A SURVEY OF FORTY-TWO JUDGES ON THE FEDERAL COURTS OF APPEALS	HARVARD LAW REVIEW			English	Article							LAW; CANONS; LEGISLATION; TEXTUALISM; DECISION; DELEGATION; CHEVRON; STATES; RULES	This Article reports the results of a survey of a diverse group of forty-two federal appellate judges concerning their approaches to statutory interpretation. The study reveals important differences between their approaches and the approach that the Supreme Court purports to take. It also helps to substantiate the irrelevance of the enduring, but now-boring, textualism-versus-purposivism debate. None of the judges we interviewed was willing to associate himself or herself with "textualism" without qualification. All consult legislative history. Most eschew dictionaries. All utilize at least some canons of construction, but for reasons that range from "window dressing," to the use of canons to assist in opinion writing, to a view that they are useful decision tools. Most of the judges we interviewed are not fans of Chevron, except for the judges on the D.C. Circuit, which hears the bulk of Chevron cases. Some of the judges interviewed believe that understanding Congress is important to a judge's work, while others do not see how judges can use such understanding to decide cases. Most express doubt that the Supreme Court's interpretive methodology binds the lower courts. The younger judges, who attended law school and practiced during the ascendance of textualism, are generally more formalist and accepting of the canons of construction, regardless of political affiliation. The older judges are less focused on canons, take a broader view of their delegated authority, and appear to grapple more with questions of judicial legitimacy. The approach that emerged most clearly from our interviews might be described as intentional eclecticism. Most of the judges we spoke to are willing to consider many different kinds of argument and evidence, and defend that approach as the only democratically legitimate one. Yet at the same time many observe a gap between how they actually decide cases and how they write opinions, a gap they attribute to the disconnect between the expectations of the public and the realities of judicial decisionmaking.

A model for sentiment and emotion analysis of unstructured social media text	ELECTRONIC COMMERCE RESEARCH			English	Article						Sentiment analysis; Bag-of-words; Lexicon; Laplace smoothing; Parts-of-Speech (POS); Machine learning	SEMANTICS; REVIEWS	Sentiment analysis has applications in diverse contexts such as in the gathering and analysis of opinions of individuals about various products, issues, social, and political events. Understanding public opinion can help improve decision making. Opinion mining is a way of retrieving information via search engines, blogs, microblogs and social networks. Individual opinions are unique to each person, and Twitter tweets are an invaluable source of this type of data. However, the huge volume and unstructured nature of text/opinion data pose a challenge to analyzing the data efficiently. Accordingly, proficient algorithms/computational strategies are required for mining and condensing tweets as well as finding sentiment bearing words. Most existing computational methods/models/algorithms in the literature for identifying sentiments from such unstructured data rely on machine learning techniques with the bag-of-word approach as their basis. In this work, we use both unsupervised and supervised approaches on various datasets. Unsupervised approach is being used for the automatic identification of sentiment for tweets acquired from Twitter public domain. Different machine learning algorithms such as Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB), Maximum Entropy and Support Vector Machines are applied for sentiment identification of tweets as well as to examine the effectiveness of various feature combinations. In our experiment on tweets, we achieve an accuracy of 80.68% using the proposed unsupervised approach, in comparison to the lexicon based approach (the latter gives an accuracy of 75.20%). In our experiments, the supervised approach where we combine unigram, bigram and Part-of-Speech as feature is efficient in finding emotion and sentiment of unstructured data. For short message services, using the unigram feature with MNB classifier allows us to achieve an accuracy of 67%.

J	Schmitt, MC				Schmitt, Mary C.			"By Any Means Necessary" A Neoliberal Sound Byte? The Memory of Malcolm X in the 1990s CBS Documentary Malcolm X: The Real Story	BLACK CAMERA			English	Article								How is it possible for Malcolm X's famous call for justice and dignity "by any means necessary" to become a neoliberal sound byte for self-responsibility? What are the social, cultural, and economic conditions that demand a liberal refashioning of the history and memory of Malcolm X? What is at stake not only in the erasure of Malcolm X's radical message, but also in its deployment in the service of neoliberal policies and logic? This essay explores these questions through a close analysis of the 1992 CBS television documentary Malcolm X: The Real Story. To set the foundation for this analysis, I first explore the resurgence of Malcolm X's memory in the 1990s and the cultural, political, and economic conditions that shaped the era's discourse on race. To develop a radical lens through which to interpret the documentary, I relate racial capitalism, neoliberalism, and social movement history to the political contexts of the Reagan and Clinton administrations. In the final analysis, I closely examine rhetorical and visual devices to illustrate how the liberal rewriting of the CBS documentary operates. I mean to expose and critically analyze how white supremacist logic undergirds neoliberal forms of antiracism and to see the ways in which neoliberal logic contains and adulterates what we can think in terms of equality and justice. I also mean to disclose how presumably antiracist texts, such as the CBS documentary, under the terms and lexicon of neoliberalism, work to rationalize and justify the violence racial capitalism necessitates.(1)	[Schmitt, Mary C.] Univ Calif Irvine, Visual Studies Program, Irvine, CA 92697 USA		Schmitt, MC (corresponding author), Univ Calif Irvine, Visual Studies Program, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.							27	0	0	0	1	INDIANA UNIV PRESS	BLOOMINGTON	601 N MORTON STREET, BLOOMINGTON, IN 47404-3797 USA	1536-3155	1947-4237		BLACK CAMERA	Black Camera	SPR	2018	9	2					10	32		10.2979/blackcamera.9.2.03			23	Film, Radio, Television	Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI)	Film, Radio & Television	GJ1CF	WOS:000434990800005					2022-03-30	
J	O'Hara, L; Taylor, J; Barnes, M				O'Hara, Lily; Taylor, Jane; Barnes, Margaret			The invisibilization of health promotion in Australian public health initiatives	HEALTH PROMOTION INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						health promotion discourse; critical perspectives; evaluation methodology; health policy	OBESITY; EDUCATION; INEQUITIES; OVERWEIGHT; COUNTRIES; EPIDEMIC; ENGLAND	The field of health promotion has arguably shifted over the past thirty years from being socially proactive to biomedically defensive. In many countries this has been accompanied by a gradual decline, or in some cases the almost complete removal of health promotion designated positions within Government health departments. The language or discourse used to describe the practice and discipline of health promotion is reflective of such changes. In this study, critical discourse analysis was used to determine the representation of health promotion as a practice and a discipline within 10 Australian Government weight-related public health initiatives. The analysis revealed the invisibilization of critical health promotion in favour of an agenda described as 'preventive health'. This was achieved primarily through the textual practices of overlexicalization and lexical suppression. Excluding document titles, there were 437 uses of the terms health promotion, illness prevention, disease prevention, preventive health, preventative health in the documents analysed. The term 'health promotion' was used sparingly (16% of total terms), and in many instances was coupled with the term 'illness prevention'. Conversely, the terms 'preventive health' and 'preventative health' were used extensively, and primarily used alone. The progressive invisibilization of critical health promotion has implications for the perceptions and practice of those identifying as health promotion professionals and for people with whom we work to address the social and structural determinants of health and wellbeing. Language matters, and the language and intent of critical health promotion will struggle to survive if its speakers are professionally unidentifiable or invisible.

Tracing Public Opinion Propagation and Emotional Evolution Based on Public Emergencies in Social Networks	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTERS COMMUNICATIONS & CONTROL			English	Article						opinion mining; the public opinion propagation; semantic classes; machine learning	STRUCTURAL BREAKS; VOLATILITY; BEHAVIOR; LEADERS; MODEL; OIL	Social network has become the main communication platform for public emergencies, and it has also made the public opinion influence spread more widely. How to effectively obtain public opinions from it to guide the healthy development of the society is an important issue that the government and other functional departments are concerned about. However, the interaction and evolution mechanism between the subject and the environment in the public opinion propagation is complicated, and the public and media attention and reaction to the incident are closely linked with the progress of the incident disposal. And public mining corpus has some shortcomings in the distribution of emotional classification. Only the timely update of artificial rules and emotional dictionary resources, it can handle new text data well. In fact, from the perspective of public opinion propagation, this paper built the network matrix between Internet users through the forwarding relationship, and used the social network analysis method and the emotion mining analysis technology to study the interaction and evolution mechanism between the subject and the environment in the public opinion propagation, and it studied the role of users in the emotional propagation of social networks. This paper proposed a sentiment analysis method on the micro-blog platform, which expanded the emotional dictionary and took sentence and emoticon and sentence patterns into account, which improved the accuracy of positive and negative classifications and emotional polarity analysis of the micro-blog.

Distributional semantics have become amongst the important trends in machine learning (ML) applications. Word embeddings are distributed representations of words that learn semantic relationships from a large corpus of text. In the social context, the distributed representation of a word is likely to be different from general text word embeddings. This is relatively due to the unique lexical semantic features and morphological structure of social media text such as tweets, which implies different word vector representations. In this paper, we collect and present a political social dataset that consists of over four million English tweets. An artificial neural network (NN) is trained to learn word co -occurrence and generate word vectors from the political corpus of tweets. The model is 136MB and includes word representations for a vocabulary of over 86K unique words and phrases. The learned model shall contribute to the success of many ML and NLP applications in microblogging Social Network Analysis (OSN), such as semantic similarity and cluster analysis tasks.

Currency counterfeiting is a crime against the State that is severely punished. Two Colombian citizens denounced each other as counterfeiters. Two different stories are opposed during the trial: the prosecution, brought by Jose Maria Rojas and the government, and the defense, brought by Clara Cardenas. As a result, Cardenas was condemned but later she was released due to illness. However, there is an untold history between Clara and Jose Maria that raises suspicions. Ethnographic methodology was used on the texts to study lexical units and communication events. It also helps to understand values and beliefs from the 19th-century society.

One of the major threats associated with online media is the propagation of false statements on behalf of celebrities with the aim of tarnishing their public image especially as a part of online political campaigns. The scenario calls for the need of analyzing the authorship of documents with less contents and capturing the author style from among a large number of candidate authors belonging to the same domain. This is a less explored area of authorship analysis as the task is challenging because traditional methods fail to acquire accuracy when the contents of different authors are pertaining to same topic. Here we propose a method that accomplishes the task of analysis in such an environment, by employing psycholinguistic, lexical, and syntactic aspects of an author combined with word co-occurrences obtained by modeling the style word pattern of the text. The method identifies an author's individualistic form of expression of emotional aspects, sociolinguistic aspects and word co-occurrences, to obtain an author-style pattern for each candidate author. An author-specific model is generated. The questioned document is fed into the different models so formed, and the final decision regarding the authorship is made based on the ensembled learning method. The experimental results of the proposed method has secured a precision of 0.98 in best case and 0.45 in worst case, thereby illustrating an improvement in the accuracy of authorship attribution of short texts, in comparison with the existing methods.

Indonesia is one of the top five nations social media users in general, especially Twitter. This becomes an interesting thing when trying to see public opinion on a government service. Opinion mining can be used to get information from textual twitter to be processed into an information by classifying existing information into positive information classes and negative information classes. In this research, we try to do opinion mining on public opinion about Identification card (KTP) service in Surabaya city. We compare between supervised and unsupervised methods to see their performance for each classifier. In unsupervised the sentiwordnet approach is used to classify between negative and positive opinions. Supervised Support Vector Machine (SVM) method is used to create a classification model to define an opinion. Before the data is classified, preprocessing steps are used to make the data better. In addition, the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) approach is used to see for topics that tend to be strong which affects a negative or positive opinion. The result of the classification model by using SVM achieved accuracy rate of 75%.	[Aziz, Moh Nasrul; Firmanto, Ari; Fajrin, A. Miftah; Ginardi, R. V.

Indeed, previous studies restricted to spoken political discourse had established the following conclusions: 1. D'ailleurs was used in the exegesis of key political arguments; 2. It plays a crucial role in managing the speaking turns; 3. par ailleurs was absent from these spoken data. The present study incorporates these previous observations and compares them with results obtained by working on written corpora and casual recorded conversations. These data enable us to study and contrast the cohesion and coherence functions of both d'ailleurs and par ailleurs which which are described in lexicographic sources as having very similar functions. Our conclusions include a much higher frequency of par ailleurs in written and more formal discourse and confirm the presence d'ailleurs in casual conversations. The study suggests as well similar cohesive functions such as introduction of a new rheme, however in a different fashion: d'ailleurs works works within an argumentative linearity while par ailleurs within an argumentative split. Our corpus consists of spoken data (43,000 words of political interviews and 25,000 words of casual conversation) and written data (more than one million words of journalistic articles gathered for a previous study). Our methodology includes corpus linguistics and our analysis is anchored within the theoretical framework of systemic functional linguistics (Halliday and Matthiessen 2004, inter alia).

STUDII DE LINGVISTICA			English	Article						migration; critical discourse analysis; empathy; solidarity communist French and Cypriot Greek newspapers; stance taking	NEWS	Both news media and politicians, taking advantage of their cultural authority through spoken and written texts, contribute to forming public opinion, in particular with the use of discursive means, to shape the way people understand migration. Research has so far pointed to negative representations of the Other and argumentation against migrants and refugees revolves around the topoi of burden, illegality, insecurity, violence and threat, which are known to trigger emotions such as resentment, anger and fear. However, media coverage of refugees' arrivals can also contribute to a positive construction of migrants' identities: this is what has been called 'counter-narrative', i.e. a set of narratives aimed at changing the mainstream discourse, which is overwhelmingly negative. This study focuses on the thematic, lexical and syntactic choices in Greek Cypriot and French communist newspapers (Haravgi and L'Humanite respectively) and the choices used to construct an argumentation which fosters the inclusion of migrants. Focusing mainly on headlines, the study adopts critical discourse approaches (Wodak 2001, inter alia; van Dijk 2001, inter alia) and uses tools from corpus linguistics methodologies (Bednarek 2008; Baker et al. 2008; van Dijk 1995, inter alia) to extract and analyze salient lexical items. The results show similarities in the way stance is constructed, for instance an anti EU stance is common to both newspapers, however the Greek Cypriot newspaper appeals to Christian values to foster charity and empathy, and the French newspaper appeal to the legal rights of migrants and the French citizen's duty to foster solidarity.

Every post on Facebook actually can imply the user. s emotion or opinion. In this paper, we present our analysis on posts associated with left-and right-wing politics in the United States of America. Our dataset contains posts several related Facebook fan pages. We analyze sentiment of posts for the prediction of left-or right-wing politics. We build sentiment features for the prediction and evaluate prediction performance. The results show that F1-score can be as high as 0.95 when TF-IDF is used with a decision tree. Posts generally involve emotional words. We use the lexical databases for sentiment analysis. Our experiment results show that the sentiment analysis is sensitive to some classification algorithms.

This paper presents an algorithmic model that suggests metaphoric means of referring to concepts. For example, given a word such as government, the method may propose expressions such as father, nanny, corresponding to common ways of thinking about the government. To achieve this, the model draws on MetaNet, a manually created repository of conceptual metaphor, in conjunction with lexical resources like FrameNet and WordNet and automated interlinking techniques. These resources are connected and their overall graph structure allows us to propose potential metaphoric means of referring to the given input words, possibly constrained with additional metaphoric seed words, which may be provided as supplementary inputs. The experiments show that this algorithm greatly expands the potential of the original repository for this task by enabling new connections to be drawn.

This article reconstructs her biography through archival documents and through the autobiographical novel of her grandson Tommaso III: Le Livre du Chevalier Errant (1403-1405). In this work Riccarda - along with all the other women that appear in the text - is described through a lexical and semantic register directly linked to the style used by Christine de Pizan in her novel Cite des Dames. It is indeed quite probable that Tommaso III often visited de Pizan's atelier in Paris while the two were writing their respective novels.

Drawing on Hyland's (1998a) taxonomy of epistemic lexical verbs, the contrastive analysis combines quantitative and qualitative methods to consider how rhetorical variation is affected by both the culture of the discipline and the culture of the writer. The investigation is carried out on a specialised corpus comprising 48 research articles (12 per discipline and cultural background) published in international and national (Czech) academic journals. Apart from establishing the frequency of occurrence of judgement and evidential epistemic lexical verbs, the analysis considers the immediate co-text of the target items and the distribution of different types of epistemic lexical verbs across the rhetorical sections of research articles. The results of the investigation indicate that while the lower frequency of use of epistemic lexical verbs in research articles by Czech writers is due to intercultural variation, the preferences towards the use of specific types of epistemic lexical verbs, the clusters they form, and their distribution across the rhetorical sections of research articles seem to reflect both cultural and disciplinary considerations. These findings suggest that culture and discipline seem to govern different aspects of rhetorical choices in academic discourse.

Therefore we consider the analysis Russian periodicals being of great current interest. People from different countries have diverse worldviews due to some peculiarities of their mentality. Perceiving advertisement isn't an exception. That's why it is necessary to take into account the following aspects of different cultures while conducting international advertising campaigns: a) a person's behavioural signals; b) artistic devices of verbal and visual advertising constituents; c) cultural images and symbols; d) social symbolism. In order to provoke a positive attitude from the side of the purchaser and stimulate him to buy the advertised product ethnocultural factors are to be considered in the advertisement. The most common method in the modern Russian magazine advertising texts is phraseological unit (PU) transformation. Phraseological unit transformation is unusual, devoid of automat ismusage of PU with a modified form and contents. Transformed phraseological units help to create a brighter and more effective advertising text in periodicals. A set expression acquires an additional meaning included by the author and due to the actualization PE becomes an organic part of the advertising text. Transformations of phraseological units is a perfect way of improving ratings of advertised services or goods.

The adjectives atomic and nuclear became the object of the analysis: we give their characteristics in the lexical system of the Russian language, present the frequency of their use in different types of discourse, study more than 300 contexts of their use with nouns in the modern political discourse. The adjectives are studied in their direct and figurative meanings in neutral texts, as well as in pejorative (negative) and ameliotory (positive) contexts. It has been established that the Russian political discourse is characterized by prevailing use of adjectives atomic and nuclear in direct meaning. It has been revealed that the basis of metaphorization as the main way of creating figurative meanings of the adjectives in the political discourse is represented with such features as powerful release of energy, concentration, innovativeness, progress. We show the mechanism of leveling the pejorative axiological component of the phrase atomic bomb arising from its use in direct meaning and the appearance of ameliotory connotative meanings in the neutral phrase nuclear reactor. It has been found that the units under study are not recorded by lexicographic sources in figurative meanings, since they express an occasional sense in the political discourse.

J	Frolova, OE				Frolova, Olga E.			THE 1918 CONSTITUTION OF THE RSFSR: A LINGUISTIC PORTRAIT OF THE TEXT	IZVESTIYA URALSKOGO FEDERALNOGO UNIVERSITETA-SERIYA 2-GUMANITARNYE NAUKI			Russian	Article						language of legislation; official and business functional style; active and passive constructions; statement; present tense; future tense; modality; grammatical, lexical, and figurative means; journalism; stylistic coloring		This article describes the referential aspect, grammatical, morphological, and lexical means of the text of the 1918 Constitution of the RSFSR as characteristics of the official functional style. The author aims to describe text elements kept by the official style throughout the 20th century and the ones that were its journalistic variations. The Constitution as a genre fixes a certain position achieved in the economy and politics and has a prescriptive character. A specific feature of the reference of the 1918 Constitution is its declarative nature and the attribution of a chain of situations to the future, which means it was not a statement but a proclamation of intentions. The complexity of the modal status of the text of the 1918 Constitution lies in the combination of modality of obligation and the possibility expressed by verbal predicates in the forms of the future tense, as well as constructions with the noun in the meaning of "plan", "planned actions". Additionally, the 1918 Constitution includes a foreign policy aspect. The tasks facing the Third All-Russian Congress of the Soviets concern the space that extends beyond the borders of Russia, since it is a question of victory of socialism in all countries. The 1918 Constitution does not consolidate the already achieved status of society and the state, describing the legal state of the country and society with the help of predicates in the present tense, but declares intentions and goals to be achieved by means of grammatical, modus, and lexical means. Compositionally, the sphere of the future extends to Chapters 1-5, which set forth the fundamental provisions of the law. The vocabulary of the 1918 Constitution is heterogeneous. In the text of the 1918 Constitution, there are three lexical layers: a) units belonging to the official style; b) units inherent mainly in journalistic texts; c) units having synonyms in the official style. In the lexicon of the text, there are terms and units with an official stylistic colouring. The new terms include such nominations as "unemployed elements", "poor people", "socialisation", etc. The article compares two versions of the 1918 Constitution, i.e. the first publication and the text on the ConsultantPlus website. The difference between the two texts lies in the fact that the first publication of the Constitution is characterised by: a) expression conveyed by means of word order; b) abbreviations; c) proper names; all of these are absent from the later version of the Constitution.

We used a corpus-driven approach with the noisy channel for spelling correction. It infers linguistic knowledge from a text corpus. The approach can be ported to other written languages with little effort as long as they are typed using a QWERTY keyboard with direct mappings between keystrokes and characters. Since Amharic letters are syllabic, we used a modified version of the System for Ethiopic Representation in ASCII for transliteration in the like manner as most Amharic keyboard input methods do. The proposed approach is evaluated with Amharic and English test data and has scored better performance result than the baseline systems: GNU Aspell and Hunspell. We get better result due to the smoothed language model, the generalized error model and the ability to take into account the context of misspellings. Besides, instead of using a handcrafted lexicon for spelling error detection, we used a term list derived from frequently occurring terms in a text corpus. Such a term list, in addition to ease of compilation, has also an advantage in handling rare terms, proper nouns, and neologisms.

This Chapter explores an understanding of tradition as that group of rules or practices which sits alongside core governing texts of groups within civil society. It identifies tradition as that which facilitates the contextualisation of civil society groups over time. It then examines how tradition could be used as a tool for engendering peaceful civil society relations. To do this it first explains the rationale for identifying plural religious traditions as important for strong civil society building, including for the protection of fundamental rights and the socio-economic well-being of a nation. Tradition is then proposed as a means of countering the exclusion of plural religious voices from the public square arising both as a result of the secular narrative manifesting itself in extreme forms of Laicite and as a result of forms of theocracy and confessionalism. The chapter does this by identifying the development of the concept of tradition, setting out dictionary definitions, definitions within the discipline of law and their interaction and links with definitions within the three Abrahamic faiths. The overarching thesis drawing these threads together is that the various methods of forming and using tradition by intermediate institutions of civil society could inform the creation of a platform as a dialogical basis to build consensus amongst individuals, institutions of civil society and governments. This envisages a plurality of religious voices not as a threat but rather as a richly diverse canvas upon which to paint the interactions of civic life and formulate the law that governs those interactions.

This type of alternation has been previously explained in terms of rhetorical function (whether the item is 'given' as opposed to 'new'), and phraseology (whether the item is seen as a 'packed' lexicalised term, or an 'unpacked' expanded nominal). In this paper, we suggest that other factors may also be involved, and we examine four specific cases from two different varieties of scientific English (Scientific Research Articles vs. Science Forums). Here we investigate the underlying constraints that govern this alternation, and we try to establish whether there is a preference for writers to 'unpack' nominal groups early on in a text and then to 're-pack' them later on. Overall, we suggest a number of parameters that may explain the choice of one structure over another. Finally, and more generally, we show that this grammatical variation is a particularly productive resource in English nominal groups, and as such contributes to the rhetorical and cognitive construction of scientific demonstration in particular and scientific discourse more generally.

One such contribution was the Dictionary of Islam compiled by the Anglican missionary Thomas Patrick Hughes, who was serving in Peshawar on the border between British India and Afghanistan. Drawing upon sources such as collections of Hadith, he provided both brief definitions and some longer analyses of a wide range of aspects of Muslim beliefs, practices and history. However, his compilation was not entirely based on textual sources, but was also informed by daily contact with Muslims in and around Peshawar, particularly Maulavi Ahmad of Tangi. Hughes combined his interest in defining Islam with a passion for exploring and explaining Afghan culture and politics to his readership in Britain. Although situated on the edges of empire', Hughes nonetheless found himself at the centre of world events as the intrigue between Britain and Russia resulted in the Second Anglo-Afghan War. Although located in what some considered a minor province on the periphery of the Muslim world, he nonetheless produced a major reference work on Islam that is still in print.

One of the most popular social networks for microblogging that has a great growth is Twitter, which allows people to express their opinions using short, simple sentences. These texts are generated daily, and for this reason it is common for people to want to know which are the trending topics and their drifts. In this paper we propose to deploy a mobile app that provides information focusing on areas, such as, Politics, Social, Tourism, and Marketing using a statistical lexicon approach. The application shows the polarity of each theme as positive, negative, or neutral.

J	Irineu, LM				Irineu, Lucineudo Machado			For a Philology of discourse: Latinity, Ethos, Discursive Traditions and a transdisciplinary analytical exercise	LABORHISTORICO			Portuguese	Article						Latinity; Ethos; Discursive traditions; Philology; Discourse		This article aims to examine the lexical resources that demonstrate, in a linguistic and discursive way, the diachronic expression of the set of self images projected in the Jornal do Brasil and Clarin editorials, between the years of 1945 and 2014, in a transdisciplinary analytical exercise we call the philology of discourse. For this, from the theoretical point of view, we focus on the concepts of latinity, ethos and discursive traditions from the studies of Garcia Canclini (2008), Maingueneau (2008) and Kabatek (2001), respectively. From the methodological point of view, we return to the examination of lexical resources and their inscription as linguistic-discursive elements indicating the emergence of the images of themselves in the 50 texts that make up the corpus, according to each periodical, in terms of changes and permanences in the cut time, with emphasis on the various effects of meaning triggered in the enunciation. From the analytical point of view, we find, in the analyzed data, the recurrence of lexical resources: (i) the semantic field related to the notions of hope, nationalism, pain, grief and indignation, in dialogue with the historical, political, religious and economic discourses in the two generations of Jornal do Brasil; and (ii) the semantic field concerning the notions of nationalism, indignation, hope and humanism, in dialogue with the scientific, economic and political discourses in the two generations of Clarin editorials. These findings allow us to affirm that the theoretical interface established in this research between Discourse Analysis and Romanic Philology, in dialogue with Cultural Studies, is promising for the diachronic analysis of discursive phenomena, such as self-images.

So the data present in scattered and unstructured manner needs to be managed properly and in this context sentiment analysis has got attention at very large level. Sentiment analysis can be defined as organization of the text which is used to understand the mind-sets or feelings expressed in the form of different manners such as negative, positive, neutral, not satisfactory etc. This paper explains the sentiment analysis, its levels and different approaches which are used with sentiment analysis.. Sentiment Analysis is one of the most popular application in text mining and with the integration of machine learning algorithms, deep learning algorithms it becomes more effective and is used in large number of businesses to increase their productivity and to make better customer experience. A review on how deep learning techniques are used by the researchers in different applications of sentiment analysis is also include in this paper.

J	Kucis, V; Majhenic, S				Kucis, Vlasta; Majhenic, Simona			Cultural and stress-related manifestations of political controversial language in the European Parliament from the view of interpreters	BABEL-REVUE INTERNATIONALE DE LA TRADUCTION-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TRANSLATION			English	Article						European Parliament; controversial statements; interpreters; stress; transcultural communication		Translation and interpreting are not only linguistic activities, but also to a large extent primarily activities of cultural transfer. Transcultural communication displays complexity, diversity and readiness for conflict in communicative interaction, so the interpreter/translator, as an intercultural mediator, is assigned a special communicative role in this regard. This article examines how interpreters at the European Parliament deal with controversial language rendering evaluative components of political statements as well as whether there is a rise in stress-related disfluencies in the interpretation of such statements and whether intonation (dis) similarities between the source text and the interpretations occur in the context of cultural and lexical know-how. Seven excerpts from four sessions of the European Parliament in the last six years and their interpretations into Croatian, Slovene, English, French and German were analysed from the point of view of stress and culture. Deviations in pitch and intensity levels of both the speaker and the interpreters were calculated and statistically compared in the light of differing cultural know-how. The intonation results for these interpreting examples showed that all the interpreters followed the speaker's pitch deviations to a certain extent. Analysis of politically-controversial statements also revealed that more than 80% of the interpretations selected contained stress-related disfluencies and almost 70% contained some form of discrepancy with the source text at a lexical level. The interpretations therefore largely contained fewer negative evaluative components of controversial language than the speakers in the European Parliament.

"Event data," which codes structured actor-event-target triples from text, is a particularly useful form of data. Most publicly available event datasets, though, are limited to English only, limiting their usefulness for studying many regions. We demonstrate new techniques for coding events in English, as well as in Arabic, a previously uncoded language. In order to generate language-specific political event data, "actor" and "verb" dictionaries are required for each specific language. Efficiently developing an accurate and extensive dictionaries is a difficult challenge. In this paper, we describe four different approaches we have used to solve the problem of producing dictionaries and how other researchers can use our ideas to develop dictionaries in a new language or new ontology. This work stems from an ongoing NSF RIDIR project, "Modernizing Political Event Data" which aims to produce multilingual event data and the software needed for researchers to produce custom datasets.

B	Makouar, N		Alhawary, MT		Makouar, Nadia			CORPUS LINGUISTICS AND CRITICAL READING AND THINKING Proposals for teaching learning sequences based on journalistic corpora in Modern Standard Arabic	ROUTLEDGE HANDBOOK OF ARABIC SECOND LANGUAGE ACQUISITION	Routledge Handbooks		English	Article; Book Chapter								The aim of this study is to show the possibility to integrate corpus analysis tools into language learning activities along with a critical thinking approach. Many studies in second language acquisition have introduced the use of text analysis tools into the classrooms. Known as data-driven learning, this approach allows L2 learners to read and interpret texts critically and acquire language skills more easily. The approach has been adopted in many languages, but it has yet to be applied in Arabic. To this end, a media corpus was used consisting of news articles that covered the Bahrain and the Egyptian revolutions in 2011, from Al-Jazeera, Al-Sharq Al-Awsa., Al-Wasa., and Al-Masry Al-Yawm. For a theoretical framework, the theory of interpretive semantics has been adopted along with textometry methods (Lexico 3) for interpreting and teaching texts. Through combining theoretical principles with textometry tools, it was possible to characterize the ideological and political orientation of the different enunciators of Arabic media texts. After a careful analysis of the corpus, an exploratory case study was conducted with four French-speaking learners of Arabic. In the course of the study, the participants received the treatment of the new approach over a seven-week sequence, and their performance was qualitatively analyzed. The findings clearly point to the potential of the approach and of using corpus analysis tools and metalinguistic awareness in enhancing participants' reading and critical reading/thinking skills. The study demonstrated that it is possible to develop a hermeneutic reading process and improve interpretative and knowledge-construction process skills and strategies, as well as build more interdisciplinary bridges in the curricula.

News Analytical Toolkit allows a user to compare news sites and their political articles by coverage, mood, sentiment, and objectivity. The user can sort through the news by topic, which was determined using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). LDA is a probabilistic method used to discover latent topics within a series of documents and cluster them accordingly. Each news article can be considered a mix of multiple topics and LDA assigns a set of topics to each with a probability of it pertaining to that topic. For each topic, a user can then discover the coverage, mood, sentiment and objectivity expressed by each author and site. The mood was determined using IBM Watsons ToneAnalyzerV3, which uses linguistic analysis to detect emotional, social and language tones in written text. The analyzer is based on the theory of psycholinguistics, a field of research that explores the relationship between linguistic behavior and psychological theories. The sentiment and objectivity scores were determined using SentiWordNet, which is a lexical database that groups English words into sets of synonyms and assigns sentiment scores to them. The features were combined to plot an interactive graph of how opinionated versus how analytical an article is, so that the user can click through them to get a better understanding of the topic in question.

A Comparative Digital Social Science Analysis of Comments on Public Facebook Pages from Romania and Hungary	INTERSECTIONS-EAST EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOCIETY AND POLITICS			English	Article						Social Media; Hate Speech; Romania; Hungary; Digital Social Science; Text Mining	AGENDA	Online hate speech, especially on social media platforms, is the subject of both policy and political debate in Europe and globally from the fragmentation of network publics to echo chambers and bubble phenomena, from networked outrage to networked populism, from trolls and bullies to propaganda and non-linear cyberwarfare. Both researchers and Facebook Community Standards see the identification of the potential targets of hateful or antagonistic speech as key to classifying and distinguishing the latter from arguments that represent political viewpoints protected by freedom of expression rights. This research is an exploratory analysis of mentions of targets of hate speech in comments in the context of 106 public Facebook pages in Romanian and Hungarian from January 2015 to December 2017. A total of 1.8 million comments were collected through API interrogation and analyzed using a text-mining niche-dictionaries approach and co-occurrence analysis to reveal connections to events on the media and political agenda and discursive patterns. Findings indicate that in both countries the most prominent targets mentioned are connected to current events on the political and media agenda, that targets are most frequently mentioned in contexts created by politicians and news media, and that discursive patterns in both countries involve the proliferation of similar stereotypes about certain target groups.

Most of the posted tweets or comments reflect the impressions of the Tunisian public towards social, economical and political major events. These opinions have been tracked, analyzed and evaluated through sentiment analysis systems. In the current study, we investigate the impact of several preprocessing techniques on sentiment analysis using two sentiment classification models: Supervised and lexicon-based. These models were trained on three Tunisian datasets of different sizes and multiple domains. Our results emphasize the positive impact of preprocessing phase on the evaluation measures of both sentiment classifiers as the baseline was significantly outperformed when stemming, emoji recognition and negation detection tasks were applied. Moreover, integrating named entities with these tasks enhanced the lexicon-based classification performance in all datasets and that of the supervised model in medium and small sized datasets.

In the article for the study of military vocabulary in the language of Ukrainian periodicals at the beginning of the XXI century observation and descriptive methods are used. At different stages of the study, the method of functional analysis was used to determine the stylistic load of lexical units. It is concluded that due to a number of extra-linguistic factors of socio-political orientation, the modern Ukrainian language was enriched with new tokens of military actions, processes and states, which is reflected in the pages of the national press of the second decade of the XXI century. In particular: the level of development of science and technology in the language environment, socio-political conditions in the linguistic society, the state language (terminology) policy in society, the functional status of the state language, the international status of the national language. The military vocabulary is singled out into two groups: 1) the one that names persons; 2) the one that characterizes processes, actions and states. According to our observations, the most significant manifestations are lexemes of foreign origin for the nomination of persons. Quite often, military vocabulary has a negative coloring, contrasts with the neutral vocabulary and attracts the attention of the reader. The military vocabulary is still a little explored layer of lexicology and requires a thorough study, in particular, the question of replenishment of thematic groups, word-building potential of lexemes, etc.	[Navalna, Maryna; Kaluzhynska, Yuliia] Pereiaslav Khmelnytskyi Hryhorii Skovoroda State, 30 Sukhomlynskyi Str, UA-08401 Pereiaslav Khmelnytskyi, Kyiv Region, Ukraine		Navalna, M (corresponding author), Pereiaslav Khmelnytskyi Hryhorii Skovoroda State, 30 Sukhomlynskyi Str, UA-08401 Pereiaslav Khmelnytskyi, Kyiv Region, Ukraine.	mnavalna@gmail.com; kaluzhynskaya@gmail.com	navalna, maryna/AAH-5756-2019; Kaluzhynska, Yuliia/AAE-7242-2020	Kaluzhynska, Yuliia/0000-0002-9787-2686; Naval'naa, Marina/0000-0002-5064-3122				16	0	0	0	1	STATE HIGHER EDUCATIONAL ESTABLISHMENT	PEREYASLAV-KHMELNYTSKYI	VUL SUKHOMLYNSKOHO 30, PEREYASLAV-KHMELNYTSKYI, 08400, UKRAINE	2309-1797	2415-3397		PSYCHOLINGUISTICS	Psycholinguistics		2018	24	2					218	235		10.31470/2309-1797-2018-24-2-218-235			18	Linguistics	Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI)	Linguistics	HA3LI	WOS:000450152200012		gold, Green Submitted			2022-03-30

It is the need of the hour to be able to mine this information that is presented to us. Sentimental analysis refers to mining of this raw information to make sense. The discipline of opinion mining has seen a lot of encouragement in the past few years augmented by involvement of social media like Instagram, Facebook, and twitter. The hidden message in this web of information is useful in several fields such as marketing, political polls, product review, forecast market movement, Identifying detractor and promoter. In this endeavor, we introduced sentiment rating system for a particular text or paragraph to determine the opinions polarity. Firstly we resolve the searching problem, tokenization, classification and reliable content identification. Secondly we extract probability for given text or paragraph for both positive & negative sentiment value using naive bayes classifier. At last we use sentiment dictionary (SD), sentiment degree dictionary (SDD) and negation dictionary (ND) for more accuracy. Later we blend all above mentioned factor into given formula to find the rating for the review.	[Nithyakalyani, A.; Ushasukhanya, S.; Nagamalleswari, T. Y.

LEXICAL PECULIARITIES OF TRANSLATION OF SOCIAL AND POLITICAL TEXTS (ON THE MATERIAL OF ENGLISH AND TATAR LANGUAGES)	5TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON EDUCATION AND SOCIAL SCIENCES (INTCESS 2018)			English	Proceedings Paper	5th International Conference on Education and Social Sciences (INTCESS)	FEB 05-07, 2018	Istanbul, TURKEY			linguistics; language; lexical peculiarities; translation; social and political texts; English; Tatar		The urgency of the problem under investigation is stipulated by the fact that questions of comparative and typological study of social and political of the English and Tatar languages remain a littlestudied. Intensity of changes in public life is directly proportional to intensity of lexical transformation at each stage of its development. Therefore it is so important to research lexical peculiarities of translation of social and political texts in close connection with the historical period and the political tendencies reigning at that time in society. The purpose of the paper is to determine definition of lexical peculiarities of translation of social and political texts, and also detection of universal and national characteristics in translation of the analyzed text from English into Tatar. Methods and techniques used in the study: descriptive method with its main components -observation, interpretation and generalization; the method of contextual analysis; the method of a solid sample of the actual material from the original texts. The main results of the paper. It is important to consider linguoculturological and local knowledge of this or that state in process of conversion of social and political vocabulary, besides some translation peculiarities of those languages from which a translation is made. Also it is important to adhere to high lexical level as semantic changes which are result of language contact are considered as the level of a lexical meaning of the word, and its semantic structure within cross-cultural communication of English. The materials of this article can be useful for students, master program undergraduates, post-graduate students while learning Tatar and English.

J	Oko, CMW				Oko, Christina M. Willis			Orthography development for Darma (The case that wasn't)	LANGUAGE DOCUMENTATION & CONSERVATION			English	Article							LANGUAGE; COMMUNITY; GENDER	As the discipline of language documentation and description evolves, so do the expectations placed on researchers. Current trends emphasize collaborative efforts that prioritize tangible contributions to the community, such as a pedagogical grammar, dictionary, or collection of texts. Some argue that for unwritten languages orthography development is imperative so that materials prepared by the researcher (perhaps in collaboration with the community) are accessible to speakers. In light of the current discussions of methodology and ethical issues related to endeavors to document and describe the world's languages, this paper explores the challenges faced by a single researcher (the author) working on a single language (Darma) within a multilingual setting (in India). This project emphasizes ethnographic and discourse-centered research methodologies which reveal language ideologies that are discussed here to demonstrate that while orthography development is a reasonable objective in many cases, one must be sensitive to a variety of interconnecting issues including history, social relationships, language ideology, and local politics associated with writing and education. While orthography development has not been a viable option in the Darma Documentation and Description Project, it is nevertheless a matter that needs to be addressed for the benefit of the community as well as ongoing discussions of methodology and best practices in linguistic and anthropological research.				willisoko@gmail.com			Fulbright IIE; Fulbright-Hays DDRA; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [BCS 0236475]; Foundation for Endangered Languages	Field research for this project was supported by Fulbright IIE, Fulbright-Hays DDRA, the National Science Foundation Dissertation Improvement Grant (BCS 0236475 with Anthony C.

J	Onanuga, P				Onanuga, Paul			Exploring Post-Colonial Leadership Crisis in Africa: A Linguistic Stylistic Analysis of Osundare's The State Visit and Two Plays	JOURNAL OF LITERARY STUDIES			English	Article								The colonial experience in most African states alongside the attendant merger of nation-states based on administrative convenience precipitated the urgency for sustained positive leadership. However, the constant punctuations of civil democratic rule by military juntas forestalled the change envisaged by most African countries upon independence. Niyi Osundare is one of the most vocal literary activists from Nigeria whose writings, in reflecting the literary writer's social responsibility role, have documented and emphasised the paucity of quality leadership in Nigeria, nay the African continent. The present study is a linguistic stylistic analysis of The State Visit, a satirical drama on military encroachment into governance and Two Plays, a social commentary on the effects on leadership crisis on the masses. Emphasis is on lexico-semantics in the (re) presentation of the leadership lacuna in the texts. Culture-specific expressions, neologisms, lexical sense relations, collocational deviations and word range were established stylistic tools found to be preeminent in showcasing the post-colonial leadership rut in which African nations are bespattered.

Their translations should accordingly not only be linguistically impeccable and technically accurate, but also read as if written by a professional. This article offers new insights into the translation norms and conventions of cookbooks and recipes by discussing how corpus tools can help choose the most appropriate collocation or turn of phrase and validate hypotheses concerning crucial but non-salient choices at the lexical, syntactic, stylistic, spelling and punctuation levels. With the aid of a rich self-compiled corpus of recipes (1 million tokens, <12,000 types) we then describe several features of British and American culinary texts, outline major categories of snares lurking for the translator, discuss key characteristics of English-language recipes, and present numerous concrete examples vindicating the brownie points gained through analyses of recipe websites and cookery software in teaching English for specific purposes and specialised translation from the author's experience of more than a decade.

J	Paribok, AV				Paribok, Andrey V.			On the Philosophical Legitimateness of Heidegger's Language Licenses	VOPROSY FILOSOFII			Russian	Article						semantics; syntax; Heidegger; neologism; derivation; ambiguity; Being; functional style; comprehension activity		In this article I pretend to systematize the notorious language licenses of Heigedders' philosophical style in "Sein und Zeit" and his later works. All their main types are discussed and illustrated by examples. On account of them I conclude the existence of an essential correlation between Heideggers' philosophical self-imposed tasks and the style of their textual presentation. I enumerate 8 principal conventions of the philosophical functional writing style, which were tacitly and universally accepted down to the late twenties of the XX-th century. They include the structure of technical terms as language units, the manner of their introduction and usage in a text, the possible terminologization limits and so on. As a matter of fact, all these rules were numerously and deliberately violated by Heidegger in "Sein und Zeit" and later. We witness e.g. terminologizations by him of non-root morphemes (ausfragen, befragen, erfragen ...); creation of rootless technical terms (umhaft, Inheit ...); the trespass of the prohibition of tautological assertions (Die Welt weltet, die Sprache spricht); extremely cumbrous compound words on the very edge of the language norm (Gewissen-haben-wollen), abrupt disregard of syntax, viz. verbal governing (Fragen nach ... , Anfragen bei ...). As a consummation of all these licences, we observe numerous newly coined technical and semi-technical terms characterized by intentionally multiple derivation, where all variants are pertinent and ought to be grasped quasi-simultaneously (Abkhriftigkeit has five derivation chains, Vorhabe has two, vorgingig has three etc.). As a whole, all these novelties not only tend to establish a new canon of the philosophical functional style, but induce in the reader's mind an unprecedented type of activity and level of reflexivity in his efforts to comprehend the text. The previously extreme and unsurpassable antithesis f a lexical unit as being grasped by the mind in a moment of immobile apperception, and a syntactical structure which is being understood by a thought movement, becomes relative. The reader, therefore, has got a chance to develop an ability to be present, to witness the activity of his own mind. Finally, this very presence (and not an objectifying thought) discloses us the Being according Heidegger. The Being is non and cannot become an object.

The process begins with the analysis and interpretation of Lexicographic definitions of Camp and, close concepts to it by meaning (kitsch and Trash), followed by the interpretation and revaluation of still the most important text on Camp - Notes on Camp by Susan Sontag. Following that, the paper seeks to provide a general definition of Camp that seeks to determine, describe and indicate the boundaries of its scope. The paper revises the postulate of certain theories on Camp: firstly, only those on its gay character and its power for political subversiveness. Camp taste/sensibility/style also strives to be contextualized within the framework of fine arts on examples of certain stylistic formations and author poetics of some of the exemplary artists that belong to them, in order to provide a paradigm for the interpretation of their opus applicable to other artistic opus.

A Subword-based Deep Learning Approach for Sentiment Analysis of Political Tweets	2018 32ND INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ADVANCED INFORMATION NETWORKING AND APPLICATIONS WORKSHOPS (WAINA)			English	Proceedings Paper	32nd IEEE International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and Applications (IEEE AINA)	MAY 16-18, 2018	Krakow, POLAND	IEEE Tech Comm Distributed Processing, IEEE Comp Soc, IEEE, Pedagogical Univ Cracow		sentiment analysis; social networks; Twitter; neural networks; deep learning; lexicon-based approach		The successful use of online material in political campaigns over the past two decades has motivated the inclusion of social media platforms such as Twitter as an integral part of the political apparatus. Political analysts are increasingly turning to Twitter as an indicator of public opinion. We are interested in learning how positive and negative opinions propagate through Twitter and how important events influence public opinion. In this paper, we present a neural network-based approach to analyse the sentiment expressed on political tweets. First, our approach represents the text by dense vectors comprising subword information to better detect word similarities by exploiting both morphology and semantics. Then, a Convolutional Neural Network is trained to learn how to classify tweets depending on sentiment, based on an available labelled dataset. Finally, the model is applied to perform the sentiment analysis of a collection of tweets retrieved during the days prior to the latest UK General Election. Results are promising and show that the neural network approach represents an improvement over lexicon-based approaches for positive/negative sentence classification.

The elaboration of the characters, their dialogues, and the line notes by the author all echo the Adornian question about what type of poetry is possible after Auschwitz. Crisscrossed by a "performance of the archive," the text's reflection moves from its specific historical context, to historical analogy and timeless questions about human cruelty and fragility. Nightbirds defines the poetic diction and the atemporal character of Hilst's theater, and demonstrates the "allegorizing gaze" that results from her political and poetic use of language and space in the theater.

The wine loosens the tongues of the guests and the members of the Athenian elite, to begin with Sophocles, let themselves go to some jokes, some good words, some paidiai which make the salt of these evenings. The poet Ion of Chios, silent witness of these symposia preserved us the memory of it in its Epidemiai, work in prose quoted by Athenee and Plutarque. These verbal games are based on the repetition of the other's words, a mocking repetition made of sylleps and lexical detour. First of all, Sophocles pretends to take literally the figurative words of his interlocutor in order to better ridicule him: what could indeed denote a "rododaktylos" [rose-fingered] hand, if not a dyer's hand? The syllepsis makes the right word and induces the parody that silences the poet's opponent. Sophocles then tackles the serious isotope of military strategy by hijacking the verb of military command "stratigein" [to be a strategist] to apply it to the art of seduction. This burlesque detour then carries, by its impertinence, a political meaning. Indeed, if their aim is to make the audience laugh, these games are not for all that innocent: they aim not only, for the speaker, to discredit in front of his audience his adversary, the one he is playing with, the play on words illustrates itself as a weapon of verbal jousting; but they also carry in hollow a definition of poetry and politics, of the poet and the strategist, of which we should not neglect the scope and the social value.										36	0	0	0	0	WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH	BERLIN	GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY			978-3-11-058645-9; 978-3-11-058638-1	DYNAM WORDPLAY			2018	7						175	189		10.1515/9783110586459-009			15	Communication; Language & Linguistics	Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science &amp; Humanities (CPCI-SSH)	Communication; Linguistics	BS3ZM	WOS:000717032600009		hybrid			2022-03-30

In other words, Pacheco's poetry implies a reading code and a writing politics that turns the text into a space of both reflection and resistance. Moreover, in this essay I argue that the poetic system of recent Mexican poetry is in alignment with the immediate political and social challenges of the country in a global and transnational context, traits apparent avant la lettre in Jose Emilio Pacheco's visionary work.

J	Sboev, AN				Sboev, Alexander N.			MECHANISMS OF PRECEDENT STATEMENTS ADAPTATION IN CHINESE INTERNET COMMUNICATION	IZVESTIYA URALSKOGO FEDERALNOGO UNIVERSITETA-SERIYA 2-GUMANITARNYE NAUKI			Russian	Article						Internet communication; precedent statement; syntactic phraseology; phraseological scheme; adaptation		Modern texts contain many precedent statements, and Internet space is not an exception, Chinese Internet communication in particular. However, not all Internet users can detect precedent statements in texts, measure their features, and determine the sources of precedent statements. This article is an attempt to study precedent statements as sources of modern Chinese Internet phraseology, and also analyse their formal and semantic ways of adaptation, and examine phraseosyntactic schemes (phraseoschemes) based on precedent statements. Utterances of well-known figures, famous TV hosts, politicians, as well as posts or comments of Internet users may become precedent statements in Chinese Internet communication. Statements that acquire new meanings without changing their form and begin to function as precedent statements can be considered syntactic phraseological units, while statements with replaced lexical components can be considered phraseoschemes, underlying some sentences. Quite frequently, the use of syntactic phraseological units and phraseoschemes based on precedent statements is a response to the desire to add humorous tone to an utterance, however, if it touches upon, for example, a political aspect, the use of precedent statements is also a method of bypassing quite rigid Internet censorship in China. The article examines mechanisms of precedent statements adaptation to their secondary usage. According to the author, such mechanisms include structural transformations of the original statement, which provide, among other things, its semantic and syntactic variability, and include a secondary semantisation of the statement. The analysis allows the author to demonstrate the diversity of types of precedent statements used in modern Chinese Internet communication, and formulate questions that require further study.

J	Serra, S				Serra, Sophie			A philosophy for Here and Now? The French work of Nicole Oresme	PHILOSOPHICAL READINGS			French	Article						Nicole Oresme; Aristotle; language reform; Middle Ages; Middle French; vernacular; popularization; dissemation of knowledge; translation; vocabulary; gloss; laypersons; epistemology		The mere interest in vernacular languages as the terminological vehicle for certain medieval philosophical texts opens an interesting field of investigation, because the vast majority of texts recognized as philosophical at that time were written in Latin (or rather, as Ruedi Imbach's works have shown, do we tend to transfer onto these works the criteria of what we recognize today as falling within the philosophical discipline?). But can the history of philosophy take as its own object the opinion that the medieval thinkers themselves had on the vernacular? Is the choice of a language and thus, of a readership, not only a political gesture, but also a philosophical one? This article puts forward the hypothesis -through the examination of the treatment and use of the French medium by Nicole Oresme in his translations of Aristotle in the second half of the 14th century- that linguistic voluntarism (be it translation, spelling reform, lexical innovations) is inseparable from an underlying epistemological conception, which confronts the tension between an eternal truth and a moving and multiple human condition.

The author analyses the frequency of words ending in - ism in different types of texts and periods in the Slovak National Corpus (https://korpus.juls.savba.sk). The research shows that in this group of words the productive word-formation tendencies are the prefixation (anti-, neo-, post-, inter-, multi-etc.), the derivation from proper names (freudizmus, trumpizmus) but also the coinage of pejorative designations (papalasizmus, imidzizmus).

AN EMPIRICAL MACHINE LEARNING APPROACH TO EXTRACT AND RANK MULTI-WORD PRODUCT NAMES USING iCIW APPROACH	JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Data mining; Entity extraction; Sentiment analysis; Text mining; Document level mining; Machine learning; POS tagging	ENTITY RECOGNITION; WIKIPEDIA	Entity Extraction or product name extraction is a suitable premise for sentiment analysis. A sentiment discovers opinion of the customers on the product stated in the sentence. Extracting product names using the existing approaches from the customer's reviews are not exact most of the time. Almost many existing approaches mainly lack in addressing the product name having multiple words or sequence of words (multi-word). When compared with single word named products, extracting opinion on multi-word named products are non-trivial task as customer use either full name or part of the product name (sub-word) in product reviews. Therefore, it is the foremost challenging task in sentiment analysis to recognize appropriate complete name of a specific product using the sub-word names. Secondly, the multi-word named products or sub-word named products may occur anywhere in the review sentences, the position of the product names cannot be predicted in advance. It may occur in the beginning, middle or at the end and also with any number of times. So, identifying the position of these product names is another key issue. Therefore, this research attempt to design a novel automated improved Context Information Weight (iCIW) approach to resolve the exiting issues. The iCIW assimilates the concept of lexicon and statistical approach. The proposed iCIW model is more suitable for document analysis related to medical reports, product details repository and political documents. The experimental result reveals that the proposed method performs very efficient than existing approaches in multi-word named product extraction.

Specifically, the description of functional paradoxes in the Ukrainian language is further presented in this article, with a particular focus on phraseological units (idioms) that function in mass communication. The sources of new phraseology that percolate into mass consciousness direct it through mass media and all described manipulative strategies show that the journalists like to use phraseological units and their stylistic transformations in media texts from the headline to the conclusion. The author gives scientific interpretation of the term medial phraseological unit (idiom) and its correlation with the term new phraseological unit / phraseological innovation in Ukrainian and European Linguistics. The author gives scientific interpretation of the term medial phraseological unit (idiom) and its correlation with the term new phraseological unit / phraseological innovation in Ukrainian and European Linguistics. The research and analyzes results collected as material for innovative dictionary of new words and phraseological units (2016-2018) showed, that Ukrainian language integrates itself into the world global process, enriches itself with new lexemes thanks to the English Language, has great psycholinguistic influence from the side of active political processes and connected with the innovations development. The results of the data analysis indicate that the ratio of the new idioms to the new vocabulary in the media in Ukrainian points to the pragmatic specificity of the phraseological resources of the Ukrainian language in the twenty-first century. Comparing the corpus media phraseology in 2016 and 2017, it can be concluded that aphoristic quotations of politicians occupy a substantial place among the new phraseologisms (30% and 32% respectively), advertising slogans, including political ones (25% and 23%), calqued phraseologisms (mainly from the English language) (12% and 9%), new cliches and stamps (8% and 9%), terminological neologisms (10% and 12%), and semantically transformed phraseologisms (15%).

Particularly in dictionary-based approaches, research is far less prolific as research on the English language. We divide the most common types of content-analytical research questions into three categories: 1) research problems for which automated methods ought to be used, 2) research problems for which automated methods could be used, and 3) research problems for which automated methods (currently) cannot be used. Finally, we give suggestions for the advancement of automated text analysis approaches for Dutch texts.

Consequently, in Serbia, there are the irregularity of financial support to bird studies, the shortage in professional ornithologists, and the lack of regular academic curricula on the Class Aves. The perception of the importance of birds evolved conceptually during time. In 19th and 20th centuries in Serbia dominated a concept of the practical, so-called economic importance of birds. It was based on divergently evaluating each bird species either as beneficial or as a pest. In modern agronomy and forestry, evidence on activities of the birds, allied to humans, increased. Positivelly have been valuated especially perching bird species when controll the insects as pests, and some raptors and owls - predators of rodents. And oppositelly, lot of birds have been labelled negativelly and considered nuissible in agroculture and forestry. Problem appears when the same species, such as some raptors, are mutually beneficial (controlling rodents) and nuissible (taking poultry). In cities, negative attitude is recorded toward gregarious species that pollute public and private surfaces. The conflicts between fisheries and piscivorous birds are notoriuous. Gregarious birds attracted by huge airport landing areas and runways cause a serious security risk to the air transport. In the first half of 20th century the more sound question of assessing the importance of birds excallates, pollarising the experts into conservationists and representatives of development interests. As a result of first attempting to compromisingly regulate this matter, the international Convention for the Protection of Birds Useful to Agriculture was signed in Paris 1902. Serbian national lows followed this approach and forbided destruction of beneficial species, allowing (and even ordering) killing of bird pests. By the end of the first half of 20th century the scientists renowned in Serbia start to publicly emphasise the deficiencies of such an black/white concept. Step by step, in novelling hunt regulations the number of pest species officially decreased to few. As a result of environmental studies and under recommendations of Biodiversity Convention, the evaluation of birds in Serbia of 21th century conversed to the concept of the protection of natural values and conservation of biological diversity. Instead of most beneficial to economy, most valuable species become those most threatened, in need of most protection, to be safeguarded from extinction. Simultaneously, birds were evaluated in the scope of famous ecosystem services. Among cultural services, birds provide physical and intellectual, as well as spiritual, symbolic and other interactions with humans. True, in all cultures and religions birds play important roles. From the earliest childhood, man admires birds. Some authors recognise this as fascination of birds. The reflection or perception of the birds in traditional and contemporary creativity is multifold. The semantics of birds in general, and of individual species is complex in the cultural, linguistic, literary, artistic, historiographic, scientific, mythological, religious, political, and any other aspects. In fact, the reflection on birds in us, tells much more on us than on birds, as proved as yet in childish drawings. Birds are mentioned already in the starting sentence of Iliad, in the very beginning step of European literature. A bird is the first word of the first verse of the earliest record of a Serbian epic poem from 15th century. An unexpected avian allegoric antithesis in the beginning of one among the oldest Serbian epic poems, the one on the Fall of Serbian Empire, uses two different bird species as personifications of saints. Birds have specific position in Serbian, as well as in most other languages, that could be considered as the oldest and most persistent treasure of memorised experiences. Significance of lexic richness becommes obvious in the fact that average people knows many more traditional species names of birds than the number of species they can describe or identify on the plates or in the field. Even the designers of national courts of arms used to be unfamiliar with proper appearences of the birds they depicted. The harizmas and symbolic significances of some species do not correspond necessarily with natural characteristics of given birds. This divergence originates back to the ancient times and was communicated to modern days by medieval Physiologuses, didactic religious textes, translated to Serbian. The early inhabitants of todays Serbia gave an enormous importance to the birds. Archaeological findings from the Iron and Bronze Ages allong the middle course of Daube, and wider in central parts of Balcan Peninsula, contain a dominating number of votive and ritual ornithomorphic objects and pottery carrying avian depictions. In the same ages presentation of any other animal are very few. The abbility of birds to play the roles of excellent bioindicators is one of the classical service values in cathegory of regulating and sustaining ecosystems. Birds may indicate the status of ecosystem, the quality of habitat, the effects of climatic changes, the pollution, the spread of diseases, as well as many other changes, processes and phenomena. However, there is no instiutional service, project nor network for monitoring birds as indicators of ecological changes. Instead of that, there are some well organised and efficient programmes of civil research. Civil ornithological organisations in Serbia attract increasing number of amateur bird-watchers, bird photogaphers and naturalists. In that way, those organisations become a value themself because they create a new value - enhance the quality of life for their members. Consequently, a new interest group appears, with the conservation of existential values of birds as a principal goal. This social group calls publicly for its civil right to utilise the natural values and opposes to other such groups (hunters, fishermen) aiming to exploit nature's welth exclusively.

J	Videkanic, B				Videkanic, Bojana			LEXICON OF TANJAS OSTOJIC AND FEMINISM IN TRANSITION	SOCIOLOGIJA			English	Article						Tanja Ostojic; Contemporary Serbian Art; Participatory Art; Materialist Feminism; Post-transition; Former Yugoslavia		The text examines artist Tanja Ostojic's interdisciplinary research project entitled Lexicon of Tanjas Ostojic, in the light of feminist materialist theories, participatory art, and socio-political analysis of the former Yugoslav region. Tanja Ostojic decided to frame her project around the lives of women who share her first and last name. Ostojic's name-sisters became her collaborators as the work turned into a large-scale, long-term project involving 33 women and their personal histories. The women all share a mutual connection to the Yugoslav region that has directly or indirectly shaped their lives through its turbulent recent history. Artist's intent was to use the stories encountered by collaborating with her name-sisters as a foil to uncover and highlight the connecting personal narratives following Yugoslav wars of succession in the 1990s and in doing so point to the detrimental legacies of war and transition on women's lives. In this article, author's main argument borrows from Karen Barad's discursive-material ontology to point out that Lexicon activates a form of material feminism which functions intra-actively, in other words, in both its form and content the work recognizes that women's lives are continuously constituted and re-constituted through multiple linguistic and material formations, or through complex relationships between humans, non-humans, and various discursive and material contexts. In using materialist feminist analysis, the author argues that Lexicon gives primacy to women's agency and proposes a sustained, growing forms of resistance to the forms of post-socialist exploitation.

Besides the benefits that the platform offers, there are still various security threats relating to the fact that most extremist groups have been abusing social media to spread distorted beliefs, to incite the act of terrorism, politics, religions, to recruit, to raise funds and much more. These groups tend to include sentiment leading to illegal affairs such as terrorism, cyber-attacks, etc. when sharing their opinions and comments. Therefore, it is necessary to capture public opinions and social behaviors in social media content. This is a challenging research topic related to aspect-based opinion mining, which is the problem of determining what the exact opinions on specific aspects are rather than getting an overall positive or negative sentiment at the document level. For an entity, the main task is to detect all mentioned aspects of the entity and then produce a summary of each aspect's sentiment orientation. This paper proposes an aspect-based opinion mining model to address the problem of estimating public opinion in social media content. The model has two phases: 1 - extracting aspects based on double propagation techniques, and 2 - classifying opinions about the detected aspects with the consideration of the context of review sentences using the hybrid approach of machine learning and lexicon-based method.

Modern Greek - Dynamics and Perspectives	BALKANISTIC FORUM			Bulgarian	Article						Greek language; dynamic; language changes; neologisms		This article explores some of the dynamic processes that are taking place in the modern Greek and which are characterized by certain changes in its structure. The changes under consideration are divided into two main categories: a) changes in the grammar system of the language, and b) changes on the lexical level. As far as the first category is concerned, there are some changes that have been reflected in a number of popular textbooks and Greek language teaching aids, as the changes have been followed in their editions over the years. In particular, some changes have been studied in the verb and pronoun systems of contemporary Greek. Concerning the second category, there are number of neologisms that have entered the Greek language in recent years, the different types of foreign as well as Greek neologisms, and also those that are the product of different word-forming processes (eg neologisms with a foreign basis and a Greek suffix). Neologisms are spread over thematic areas such as computer technology and the Internet, telecommunications and the media, politics, economics, medicine, culture, sports, etc. The brief review of the changes under consideration implies the conclusion that the Greek language is not an exception among the other languages - there are analogous and equally dynamic processes characterized by various changes in the field of grammar and vocabulary as the development of human society is constantly changing our surrounding reality, which naturally leads to changes in the language - the main means of reflecting this reality.

J	Yu, M; Guo, CH				Yu, Miao; Guo, Chonghui			Using news to predict Chinese medicinal material price index movements	INDUSTRIAL MANAGEMENT & DATA SYSTEMS			English	Article						Text mining; Chinese medicinal material price index; Movement prediction	MARKET PREDICTION; SENTIMENT ANALYSIS; IMPACT; TWITTER; SYSTEMS	Purpose The purpose of this paper is to propose an approach for predicting the movements of Chinese medicinal material price indexes using news based on text mining. Design/methodology/approach A research framework and three major methods, namely, domain dictionary construction, market convergence time calculation and dimensionality reduction integrating semantic analysis, are proposed for the approach. The proposed approach is applied in practice for predicting the price index movements of the top ten Chinese medicinal materials that receive the greatest media attention. Findings A set of experiments performed herein show that a predictive relationship exists between the news and the commodity market and that each of the three major methods improves the forecasting performance. Research limitations/implications Because the field of Chinese medicinal materials lacks a corpus that can be used for sentiment analysis, the accuracy of a trained automatic sentiment classifier is lower than obtained by a manual method, which can cause the calculated convergence result to be inaccurate, thus affecting the final prediction model. The manual method of having people label news decreases the proposed method's aspects of being intelligent and automatic. Practical implications Using the method proposed herein to predict the trends in Chinese medicinal materials prices helps farmers arrange a reasonable planting plan to pursue their best interests. Social implications The method proposed herein to predict the trends in the prices of Chinese medicinal materials is conducive to the government arranging planned drug availabilities in order to avoid disasters in which herbs are looted. Originality/value The produced prediction result is meaningful in supporting farmers and investors to make better decisions in growing and trading Chinese medicinal material, which leads to financial returns on investments and the avoidance of severe losses.

EXPRESSING PERSONAL MEANING IN MODERN POLITICAL DISCOURSE: LEXICAL ASPECT	VESTNIK VOLGOGRADSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA-SERIYA 2-YAZYKOZNANIE			Russian	Article						personal meaning; political discourse; sources of personal meaning; lexical units; political vocabulary; neologism; borrowing; stylistic coloring of the word		The purpose of the paper is to investigate some lexical means of expressing personal meaning in political discourse based on the Russian language. We define the notion 'personal meaning' in various aspects, focus on its sources in different utterances: ambiguousness of reality, the bias in a person's objective picture of the world, creation of personal worlds in the process of creativity and constant expansion of knowledge. We draw special attention to the peculiarities of political discourse and some means of expressing personal meaning in it. In the practical part of the paper we present some vivid examples that express a personal meaning of the speaker: political lexis that can have positive and negative connotation, neologisms, borrowed words, jargonistic words, etc. Some examples of generalization as one more way of expressing personal meaning are given in the paper. The lexemes that have a general meaning may have a derogative connotation. Finally, we make a conclusion that personal meaning is a vital part of any text and a political text in particular. It expresses the intention of the author and it is usually verbalized in the text through diversity of lexical units. The results of the given research could be interesting for the investigators of the discourse and political discourse in particular on the subject of expressing personal meaning in it.

Nowadays, there are many problems in the management and application of government geospatial big data which come from different departments and areas, such as information islands, lower sharing efficiency and low rate of comprehensive utilization in information resources. Therefore, an integration technology of multi-source government information resources based on semantics is proposed in this paper. Based on the distributed computing framework-Hadoop, we analyze textual content and application subjects of government geospatial big data, such as socioeconomic, population and juridical person information. Based on this, with the semantic analysis and integration of multi-source government information resources, the comprehension of spatial data classification system, and related technologies, such as Chinese word segmentation, semantic computing and clustering analysis, corresponding rules and classification methods are formulated based on the classification system of various types of spatial data. Secondly, the word segmentation dictionary related to government information resources are utilized to extract text content of the data and carry out thematic classification of information resources based on the topic classification rules. Lastly, according to the semantic factors in the theme classification of government information resources, the semantic concept lattice of spatial data topics is constructed to realize the semantic matching of the subject types of government information resources. The practice shows that the integration technology of multi-source government information resources based on semantics can improve the efficiency of integration, the management and utilization level of government information resources, and increase the accuracy and effectiveness of government macro-control, market supervision, social governance and public service.

Almost all educational institutions choose virtual learning not only as a means to attract new enrolees, but also as a new working model that could combine and make effective various organizational, cultural, technical and commercial initiatives in a new format via the use of information technologies and the vast capacity of educational platforms. In this paper, the authors focus on the most successful Internet project in the field of teaching the Spanish language, the virtual platform of the Instituto Cervantes (the Cervantes Institute). The experience of the Cervantes Institute allowed the authors to systematize methodological principles of our work and it initiated the creation of a corpus of electronic training materials that allow to carry out remote work. It involves larger groups of students, correctly distributing the classroom activity in such a way that part of the assignments are performed at home during extracurricular time and further is discussed in class. The created virtual materials include phonetic, lexical, grammatical, socio-cultural components, as well as texts illustrating various spheres of communication of native speakers. Since the authors of the article work at a law institute, we believe that audio recordings of trial simulation, authentic speeches of politicians on issues of the legal and international sphere may be of particular interest.

THE CONCEPT OF "FATHERLAND" IN THE PATRIOTIC DISCOURSE	VESTNIK SLAVIANSKIKH KULTUR-BULLETIN OF SLAVIC CULTURES-SCIENTIFIC AND INFORMATIONAL JOURNAL			Russian	Article						concept; semantic field; fatherland; patriotism; patriotic education; identity		Concepts reveals complex interrelationship of personal experience and the nature of culture, define multidimensionality of the mental world. The sphere of concepts of language creates the bases for formation of the cultural person perceiving and reproducing a national image of the world. The semantic field of the concept "patriotism" includes basic values of a civil and spiritual and moral order, with concept "fatherland" acting as the kernel. Substantial consistence of the word "fatherland" conditions both the view of culture "from within" and understanding of place and role of the country in the world history. The paper interprets concept "fatherland" as a culture constant and considers it in religious (the heavenly fatherland) and secular (the terrestrial homeland) contexts as exemplified by verbal (recorded in dictionaries) and visual (icon) cultural texts. The author discovers sociocultural meaning of the concept "patriotism", its dependence on ideology and socio-political interests and demonstrates that emphasis on religious meaning of a concept "fatherland" facilitates fuller understanding of its cultural value and allows specifying the directions of patriotic education.

A valences-totaling model for English sentiment classification	KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Review						English document semantic classification; Cosine measure; Valences-totaling model		Sentiment classification plays an important role in everyday life, in political activities, activities of commodity production and commercial activities. Finding a time-effective and highly accurate solution to the classification of emotions is challenging. Today, there are many models (or methods) to classify the sentiment of documents. Sentiment classification has been studied for many years and is used widely in many different fields. We propose a new model, which is called the valences-totaling model (VTM), by using cosine measure (CM) to classify the sentiment of English documents. VTM is a new model for English sentiment classification. In this study, CM is a measure of similarity between two words and is used to calculate the valence (and polarity) of English semantic lexicons. We prove that CM is able to identify the sentiment valence and the sentiment polarity of the English sentiment lexicons online in combination with the Google search engine with AND operator and OR operator. VTM uses many English semantic lexicons. These English sentiment lexicons are calculated online and are based on the Internet. We present a full range of English sentences; thus, the emotion expressed in the English text is classified with more precision.

J	Badir, S				Badir, Semir			Issues of the notion of genre in semiotics	SEMIOTICA			French	Article						genre; cultural practices; discourse; hermeneutics; epistemology; theory		What is a genre? Applied to the textual domain, this question has received a descriptive answer in language studies. Genres would thus be distinguished from one another through formal (syntactic and lexical) traits and specific enunciative markers, as well as through the specificities of punctuation on the layout. Such response presupposes a global model where genres assemble texts (that actually undergo analysis) and are in turn integrated into discourse. I question this model in the name of empiricism: genres, as governed by usage, do not allow for such integration. Genres are heterogeneous by nature and their description cannot be rigid. The reason is that genres are a product of a certain type of interpretative practice of texts and, beyond texts, of all sorts of works. The aim of this study is to show how genre is the categorization that corresponds to a hermeneutics of appropriation and, in this sense, is reluctant to being disclosed through a formal description. Greimas seems never to have doubted this, since his semiotic project was precisely centered in the neutralization of generic categories.

Our approach extends traditional content analysis techniques by combining insights from linguistic theory and recent developments in computational techniques. We develop and employ phrase-level data dictionaries (using both noun phrases and verb phrases) from organizational documents. We use letters to the board of education from a sample of New Jersey school districts to develop measures of innovativenessone measure is based on expert assessments and the other is inductively derived. We perform rigorous tests of content validity, external validity, and predictive validity on these measures. We conclude with a discussion of implications of this new measurement approach and its potential applications to other public management contexts.

J	Pavlich, G				Pavlich, George			Before the Law: Criminalization, Accusation and Justice	LAW AND CRITIQUE			English	Review						Civil order; Criminal accusation; Criminal responsibility; Criminalization; Ethics and criminal law; Overcriminalization		This review essay critically engages three socio-legal books directed to the changing bases of criminalization; namely, Lacey (In search of criminal responsibility: ideas, interests, and institutions, Oxford University Press, Oxford, 2017); Farmer (Making the modern criminal law: criminalization and civil order, Oxford University Press, Oxford, 2016); and Norrie, Justice and the slaughter bench: essays on law's broken dialectic, Routledge, New York, 2016). The texts explore how modern (largely English) institutions of criminal law proscribe, assign responsibility and appear through contradictory socio-political 'constellations'. They variously reference criminal law's expanding punitiveness as it: embraces revived character-based ways of attributing responsibility via ideas of risk; drifts away from a social function of creating civil order; and, works through a 'broken dialectic' that fails to recognize its ethico-political auspices. The ensuing 'overcriminalization' is referenced variously, but this review questions a tendency to work off legal lexicons, with consequent limitations placed on the scope of social analysis. Referring to Roman and Cape colonial forms of criminalization, this review highlights processes of accusation that call subjects to account as criminals, thereby signalling an initiating socio-political layer upon which unequal forms of overcriminalization rest.

The capabilities of SOMs include assessment of nonlinear relationships among study variables and projection of firms and clusters in two-dimensional space based on their relative similarity. Research Findings/InsightsTo demonstrate their application to governance research, SOMs were used to study patterns of immunity to institutional governance logics in the financial services industry. Firm sensemaking and governance logics were assessed by analyzing the language and meaning of corporate codes of conduct. Content analysis was guided by the DICTION software program. DICTION uses data dictionaries to analyze the meaning of text documents based on word usage. Our results supported a configurational model characterized by distinct groupings of firms with varying degrees of acceptance of prevailing institutional governance logics. Practitioner/Policy ImplicationsSOM analysis demonstrated that context influences firm governance logics. Specifically, different interpretations of environmental pressures led to different adaptive responses suggesting reconsideration of the notion of universal or best governance practices.

I adopted methods modified from the Biber Connor Upton Approach to retrieve the expanded concordances of the lexical units almar'a (woman) and alnisa' (women) from the corpus. The extracted text reveals the discursive patterns regarding a number of topics which are discussed in Arabic newspapers, namely, socio-culture (social practices) and eco-politics. The results of the study show how and why topics related to Arab women are discursively constructed, revealing negative patterns with regard to the topics discrimination, the veil, sports, male guardianship, driving, pro-divorce settlements and municipal elections, and positive patterns concerning the topics marital status, violence, education, travel, sexual harassment, the removal of male guardianship, employment, ministerial election and political participation. The specific case of the topic (un) veil is subsequently analysed in more detail and the results reveal that the topic is associated with negative patterns within a wider socio-cultural discourse.

Cohesion is like the glue that unifies the meaning within a text through binding the textual elements. Several studies applied the model of Halliday and Hasan on different texts such as legal, political, narrative, etc., but, very scarce attention has been given to scientific texts. The aim of this study is to examine and analyze some medical texts chosen randomly in terms of the Halliday and Hasan's model by identifying both the lexical and the grammatical cohesive ties. The data analysis shows that the grammatical cohesive ties of reference and the lexical cohesive ties of reiteration carry the highest frequency among other cohesive ties. These results confirmed the significant role of cohesive ties in scientific texts.

J	Banerjee, S				Banerjee, Sushmita			Conceptualising the past of the Muslim community in the sixteenth century: A prosopographical study of the Ak_h_br al-Ak_h_yr	INDIAN ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL HISTORY REVIEW			English	Article						Ak_h_br al-Ak_h_yr; taz?kirt; "Abd al-Haqq Muhaddis Dehlawi; sufis; history of Sufism; silsilas; Chishtis; Muslim community; pr-murd relationship; prosopography; Islamic millennium	MUGHAL STATE; WORLD; 15TH-CENTURY	This article studies a sixteenth-century sufi taz?kirt (biographical dictionary), Ak_h_br al-Ak_h_yr written by Abd al-Haqq Muhaddis Dehlawi (1551-1642), an lim (scholar), who was also a sufi. The text is frequently cited as the earliest, most comprehensive and reliable biographical compilation of South Asian sufis and ulam' (learned men in religious sciences) from the thirteenth to the sixteenth century. Indeed Abd al-Haqq is best remembered for his scholasticism as a m<umacron>haddis? (a person well-versed in Prophetic traditions) which is also supposed to have made him into a rather staid scholar of Sufism. But what of him in his own society of elite Muslim intellectuals in the early seventeenth century? Abd al-Haqq was networked into the elite circles of the Mughal court, but he stayed away from Mughal patronage, communicating his ambivalence regarding its political experiments by espousing alternative paradigms. My article studies the structure of the Ak_h_br al-Ak_h_yr to comprehend how a Muslim intellectual constructed a history of his peer group at a critical juncture in the making of Mughal authority. My article follows a prosopographical methodology to explore the innovative structure of the Ak_h_br al-Ak_h_yr and its complex projection of the past of the piety-minded in Hindustan. As I argue, the Ak_h_br al-Ak_h_yr is a carefully structured, remarkable history of sufis and their networks, providing them with contexts and significance that questioned both, inherited paradigms of moral authority present in the fourteenth- and fifteenth-century sufi texts as well as those emerging in the statist renditions of the past from the courts of the Mughal emperors Akbar and Jahangir.

J	Kuntic-Makvic, B				Kuntic-Makvic, Bruna			Delta iota alpha lambda epsilon K tau omicron sigma, gamma rho alpha mu mu alpha tau alpha, signum Illyrian Rulers Official Communications According to Classical Writers Reports	TUSCULUM-CASOPIS ZA SOLINSKE TEME			Croatian	Article						Polybius; Livy; Classical literary sources; illyrian kingdom; communication; language; writing; sign; embassy		Classical writers wrote most comprehensively about the public and official diplomatic speech. In the 19th century and thanks to Dimitrije Demeter, the often quoted dialogue between the Illyrian queen Teuta and the Roman emissary (Polyb. II, 8, 6-13, Appendix 1) entered from the Polybius' report into the Croatian literature to remain productive there until today. The Polybius' report about the Illyrian and the Macedonian kings' joint embassy to the island of Rhodes show that the Illyrian emissaries were accepted there with particular attention (Polyb. XXIX, 11, 1-3; 5-6, App. 2). Titus Livy (Livius) reports that spies in Rome tried presenting themselves as diplomats (Liv. XLII, 26, 2-6, App. 3). Selected texts from the period 230 - 170 BC describe movements of emissaries between the Illyrian kingdom and various political entities in the Mediterranean. Polybius opened the question of the language that could have been used to enable proper understanding between the individuals speaking different languages. He refers to the world languages of the contemporary Mediterranean, Phoenician, Greek and Latin, as the delta iota alpha lambda epsilon kappa tau omicron sigma. (Polyb. I, 67, 7-9; 80, 1; 80, 5-6; III, 22, 3; XXVII, 15, 2-4; XXXIX, 1, 1-4; Appendices 5-10). The same noun he applied to the Illyrian language recognising it thereby as a distinct language (Polyb. XXVIII, 8, 1; 5; 7-9; Liv. XLII, 19, 13-14; 20, 2-3; App. 4). By recording that the Macedonian king requested that in his embassy to the Illyrian court there was also a person speaking the Illyrian language, Polybius confirmed that this language was strange to the Macedonian and Greek languages speakers. The Polybius' dictionary makes difference between the emissaries-diplomas able and authorised to communicate orally (pi rho epsilon sigma beta epsilon upsilon tau alpha iota, pi rho epsilon sigma beta epsilon iota sigma) in accordance with the king's instructions (epsilon nu tau omicron lambda alpha iota), the heralds conveying brief oral messages (kappa eta rho upsilon kappa epsilon sigma) and the curriers (gamma rho alpha mu mu alpha tau omicron phi omicron rho omicron iota) who carried letters (gamma rho alpha mu mu alpha tau alpha or epsilon pi iota sigma tau omicron lambda alpha iota). Polybius systematically used a developed terminology, wherefore his information that the Illyrian queen Teuta was giving orders to her general in letters (Polyb. II, 6, 3-5; App. 11) and that other persons in the Illyrian ethnarchy were reading written messages (Polyb. V, 101, 6-7; 102,2; App. 12) are to be taken as reliable. In the Classical period Mediterranean the standard was set that money made a means of communication. The coins presenting image, title and name of the king Gentius can be related to the Livy's report on the >> Illyrian sign << with which the Gentius' emissaries marked the silver that the Macedonian king donated to their ruler (Liv. XLIV, 27, 8-12; App. 13) and on the >> Illyrian silver << that the praetor Lucius Anicius Gallus carried in the triumph after the victory over Gentius in 167 BC (Liv. XLV, 43, 4, App. 14). Parts of the information provided by the Classical literary sources in the original form on the public and official communications have been lost in translations. When the originals are paid proper attention they show that, at least during the three wars with the Romans, the Illyrian rulers' domestic and international communications achieved a respectable level, adopted all the contemporary forms and included written communication of a volume that does not permit the Illyrian community of the epoque to be considered in a generalised manner as agraphic.

J	Najar, D; Mesfar, S				Najar, Dhekra; Mesfar, Slim			Opinion mining and sentiment analysis for Arabic on-line texts: application on the political domain	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SPEECH TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Opinion mining; Sentiment analysis; Arabic language; TAL; Politic; Web media		Since the continuous proliferation of the journalistic content online and the changing political landscape in many Arabic countries, we started our current research in order to implement a media monitoring system about the opinion mining in political field. This system allows political actors, despite of the large volume of online data, to be constantly informed about opinions expressed on the web in order to properly monitor their actual standing, orient their communication strategy and prepare the election campaigns. The developed system is based on a linguistic approach using NooJ's linguistic engine to formalize the automatic recognition rules and apply them to a dynamic corpus composed of journalistic articles. The first implemented rules allow identifying and annotating the different political entities (political actors and organizations). Then these annotations are used in our system of media monitoring in order to identify the opinions associated with the extracted named entities. The system is mainly based on a set of local grammars developed for the identification of different structures of the political opinion phrases. These grammars are using the entries of the opinion lexicon that contain the different opinion words (verbs, adjectives, nouns) where each entry is associated with the corresponding semantic marker (polarity and intensity). Our developed system is able to identify and properly annotate the opinion holder, the opinion target and the polarity (positive or negative) of the phraseological expression (nominal or verbal) expressing the opinion. Our experiments showed that the adopted method of extraction is consistent with 0.83 F-measure.

Ten Years of Studies (2001-2011)	CRISTIANESIMO NELLA STORIA			Italian	Article						Logos; Incarnation; Ethics		We can group the Origenian studies in the years 2001-2011 under four words: logos, incarnation, ethics and language. The Origenian logos present a challenge to contemporary theology and require a distinction to be made between logos and Gospel, in order to study their distance and their proximity. An 'against', an 'anti', a 'coupure', and a doorway, an opening and a possibility of iteration converge to heighten the critical quest. Incarnation and Christology intersect, guide and benefit from the work of editing, translation and commentary on Origenian texts. Ethics, in its multiple individual, ecclesiastical and political aspects, seems to be the subject that emerges. Finally, a new focus is drawn to the language and style and a reconsideration of rhetoric, literary form and lexical elements is proposed as a way to penetrate Origenian thought.

J	Wagner, T				Wagner, Thomas			L2 irregular verb morphology: Exploring behavioral data from intermediate English learners of German as a foreign language using generalized mixed effects models	STUDIES IN SECOND LANGUAGE LEARNING AND TEACHING			English	Article						mental lexicon; irregular verb morphology; analogy; pattern associator; apophony	INFLECTED WORDS; 2ND-LANGUAGE; RULES; ANALOGY; TENSE; ISSUE	This paper examines possible psycholinguistic mechanisms governing stem vowel changes of irregular verbs in intermediate English learners of German as a foreign language (GFL). In Experiment 1, nonce-infinitives embedded in an authentic fictional text had to be inflected for German preterite, thus testing possible analogy-driven pattern associations. Experiment 2 explored the psycholinguistic reality of the so-called apophonic path by prompting two inflections for one given nonce-word. Data were analyzed using generalized mixed effects models accounting for within-subject as well as within-item variance. The results of Experiment 1 and 2 support the notion of a pattern associator and yield only scarce evidence for the psycholinguistic reality of a universal apophonic path. Therefore, the organization of irregular verb morphology in the mental lexicon of intermediate GFL learners might best be captured by the linguistic notion of structured lexical entries as well as the psycholinguistic mechanism of an analogy-based pattern associator.

J	Baronian, L				Baronian, Luc			Two problems in Armenian phonology	LANGUAGE AND LINGUISTICS COMPASS			English	Article							STOPS	The author surveys 2 major phenomena in Armenian phonology. The first is schwa epenthesis in Western Armenian, which is known to break up the impressive consonant clusters of the language. Before looking at the synchronically epenthetic schwas in Western Armenian, it is important to first distinguish schwas that are unambiguously part of lexical representations then to recognize schwas that have led, over time, to different allomorphs. A fourth category is left to explain: schwas that break up attested clusters, but only in derived morphological environments. After listing known facts about the syllabic nature of Armenian, the author shows that motivated prosodic specifications can account for the derived environment schwas (simplifying somewhat the previous account by Vaux, 1998). The second phonological phenomenon surveyed is the voicing and aspiration patterns found in Armenian dialects. While the patterns neatly divide the linguistic domain into seven groups, the standard classifications rely on present-tense formation as a primary divider between larger groups of dialects. The author, however, highlights that the phonological division between voicing and aspiration patterns should be considered a more fundamental one, once textbook notions of geolinguistics are applied to reduce the 7-way division to a more ancient 3-way division of dialects. Indeed, sound change is a more common type of innovation used for grouping related languages and dialects, and the territorial divisions thus obtained correspond to more ancient political divisions than the morphological ones.

FOOD METAPHOR IN CONCEPTUALIZATION, CATEGORIZATION AND VERBALIZATION OF REPRESENTATIONS ABOUT THE WORLD	VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA FILOLOGIYA-TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF PHILOLOGY			Russian	Article						food metaphor; figurative lexis; phraseology; figurative lexical and phraseological field; world view		The article is concerned with the analysis of the Russian food metaphor world modeling function, its role in conceptualization, categorization and verbalization of representations about the world. Food metaphor denotes a cognitive metaphoric model which enables to perform conceptualization of cognizable phenomena from different extra-linguistic spheres by analogy with phenomena from the sphere "Food". At the linguistic level it is embodied in figurative lexis with a metaphoric internal form (kislyy (literally: acid) 'dissatisfied, sad', nakhlebnik (lit.: someone on bread) 'person who lives at others' expense), phraseological units of different structure (tochno varenyy (lit.: as if boiled) 'about a slow, weak, apathetic person', medom namazano (lit.: smeared with honey) 'attractive for many people'), proverbs (kto uspel, tot i sjel (lit.: someone, who was in time, ate something) 'a person who was the first in taking advantage of a situation gets a benefit'). At the speech level it is presented by author's expressions with a metaphoric character. The procedure for reconstruction of the figurative fragment of the Russian linguistic world view is presented including semasiological and cognitive analysis techniques. In the structural and semantic aspect the semantics of figurative units embodying food metaphor are analyzed; the lexical structure of the metaphoric field "Food" reflecting results of reality linguistic categorization by means of food metaphor is modeled. For this purpose the figurative words and expressions are combined into category-figurative paradigms presenting series of figurative nominations naming a certain phenomenon from one conceptual sphere which is analogized with different phenomena from the common source sphere with the same basis of figurative analogy. The procedure for description of category-figurative paradigms of the field "Food" is presented in the article on the material of units representing the conceptual sphere "Society", including thematic areas "Politics", "Economics", "Culture", "Social Life". In the cognitive aspect particular metaphoric models, frames and slots involved in metaphoric interaction are described; bases of figurative adaptation and typical figurative representations specific to Russian culture are determined. A successive description of category-figurative paradigms demonstrated that food metaphor of objective type takes part in characteristics of such reality spheres as "Human Being" (42 % of linguistic figurative units total number), "Material World" (22 %), "Society" (19 %), " Non-Material World" (12 %), "Environment" (2 %), " Scent" and "Sound" (2 %). The bases for figurative adaptation are presented by food product properties (form, structure, color, size, texture, flavor, nutrition value), food processing character during cooking, food intake specifics and others. Systematization of the linguistic material into category-figurative paradigms allowed presenting the fragment of the Russian linguistic world view as a result of metaphoric world-modeling.

J	Jain, VK; Kumar, S; Fernandes, SL				Jain, Vinay Kumar; Kumar, Shishir; Fernandes, Steven Lawrence			Extraction of emotions from multilingual text using intelligent text processing and computational linguistics	JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL SCIENCE			English	Article						Emotion extraction; Machine learning; Text mining; Twitter; Classification; Natural language processing	TWITTER; ELECTION; US	Extraction of Emotions from Multilingual Text posted on social media by different categories of users is one of the crucial tasks in the field of opining mining and sentiment analysis. Every major event in the world has an online presence and social media. Users use social media platforms to express their sentiments and opinions towards it. In this paper, an advanced framework for detection of emotions of users in Multilanguage text data using emotion theories has been presented, which deals with linguistics and psychology. The emotion extraction system is developed based on multiple features groups for the better understanding of emotion lexicons. Empirical studies of three real-time events in domains like a Political election, healthcare, and sports are performed using proposed framework. The technique used for dynamic keywords collection is based on RSS (Rich Site Summary) feeds of headlines of news articles and trending hashtags from Twitter. An intelligent data collection model has been developed using dynamic keywords. Every word of emotion contained in a tweet is important in decision making and hence to retain the importance of multilingual emotional words, effective pre-processing technique has been used. Naive Bayes algorithm and Support Vector Machine (SVM) are used for fine-grained emotions classification of tweets. Experiments conducted on collected data sets, show that the proposed method performs better in comparison to corpus-driven approach which assign affective orientation or scores to words. The proposed emotion extraction framework performs better on the collected dataset by combining feature sets consisting of words from publicly available lexical resources. Furthermore, the presented work for extraction of emotion from tweets performs better in comparisons of other popular sentiment analysis techniques which are dependent of specific existing affect lexicons.

Similarities and differences in constructs represented by US States' middle school writing tests and the 2007 National Assessment of Educational Progress writing assessment*	ASSESSING WRITING			English	Article						NAEP; Writing; Large-scale assessment	STUDENTS; KNOWLEDGE; INSTRUCTION; STRATEGIES; VALIDITY; AUDIENCE; GENRE	Little is known regarding the underlying constructs of writing tests used by U.S. state education authorities and national governments to evaluate the writing performance of their students, especially in middle school grades. Through a content analysis of 78 prompts and 35 rubrics from 27 states' middle school writing assessments from 2001 to 2007, and three representative prompts and rubrics from the United States' 2007 National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) writing test, this study illuminates the writing constructs underlying large-scale writing assessments through examination of features in prompts and rubrics and investigation of the connections between prompts and rubrics in terms of genre demands. We found the content of state writing assessments and the NAEP align with respect to measurement parameters associated with (a) emphasis on writing process, audience awareness, and topic knowledge, (b) availability of procedural facilitators (e.g., checklists, rubrics, dictionaries) to assist students in their writing, and (c) inclusion of assessment criteria focused on organization, structure, content, details, sentence fluency, semantics, and general conventions. However, the NAEP's writing assessment differs from many state tests of writing by including explicit directions for students to review their writing, giving students two timed writing tasks rather than one, making informational text production one of the three genres assessed, and including genre-specific evaluative components in rubrics. This study contributes to our understanding of the direction and path that large-scale writing assessments in the US are taking and how writing assessments are continually evolving.

However, the spatiotemporal dynamics of how attention is allocated during eye fixations are not completely understood. The current study explored the use of EEG alpha-band oscillations to investigate the spatial distribution of attention during reading. We reanalyzed two data sets, focusing on the lateralization of alpha activity at posterior scalp sites. In each experiment, participants read short lists of German nouns in two paradigms: either by freely moving their eyes (saccadic reading) or by fixating the screen center while the text moved passively from right to left at the same average speed (RSVP paradigm). In both paradigms, upcoming words were either visible or masked, and foveal processing load was manipulated by varying the words' lexical frequencies. Posterior alpha lateralization revealed a sustained rightward bias of attention during saccadic reading, but not in the RSVP paradigm. Interestingly, alpha lateralization was not influenced by word frequency (foveal load) or preview during the preceding fixation. Hence, alpha did not reflect transient attention shifts within a given fixation. However, in both experiments, we found that in the saccadic reading condition a stronger alpha lateralization shortly before a saccade predicted shorter fixations on the subsequently fixated word. These results indicate that alpha lateralization can serve as a measure of attention deployment and its link to oculomotor behavior in reading.

Moving from previous findings (Righettini and Sbalchiero, ICPP-international conference on public policy, 2015), related to consumer protection in the annual speeches of Italian Presidents of AGCOM, delivered between 2000 and 2015, statistical analyses of textual data are applied on the same set of texts in order to compare and contrast results and evaluate the opportunity of integrating different approaches to enrich the results. This review of results resorts to topic based methods for classification of context units (Reinert, Les Cah l'Anal Donnees 8(2):187-198, 1983), text clustering and lexical correspondence analysis (Lebart et al., Exploring textual data, 1998) in a general framework of content analysis and "lexical worlds" exploration (Reinert, Lang Soc 66:5-39, 1993), i.e., the identification of main topics and words used by AGCOM Presidents to talk about consumer protection. Results confirm the strengths and opportunities of topics detection approach and shed light on how quantitative methods might become useful to political scientists when available policy documents increase in number and size. One methodological innovation of this article is that it supplements the use of word categories in traditional content analysis with an automated topics analysis which exceeds the problems of reliability, replicability, and inferential circularity.

PATRIOTIC DISCOURSE IN THE NETWORK MEDIA SPACE	VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA FILOLOGIYA-TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF PHILOLOGY			Russian	Article						patriotism; discourse semiosis; covalency; emergence; oxymoron metaphorics; cognitive extreme; interdiscoursivity		In this paper, results of research on specifics of negative "semantic excessiveness" in the sphere of "patriotism" concepts in Russian network mass media publications (texts) are presented. The concepts "patriot" and "patriotism" being a traditional background of socially important codes of public consensus are revealed to be in the center of global connections. Conceptual analysis of popular online and offline mass media shows the dominance of discourses with ambivalence of ideological and political environment in Russia. Content analysis of traditional (offline) mass media like the newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda demonstrates that the sphere of patriotism concepts is oriented on the traditional meaning of patriotism. However, this discourse is less popular than hybrid discourses in online media. Hybrid patriotic discourses in online media are represented in several forms. Discourse analysis of online mass media publications with a significant number of page visits confirms that such hybrid forms envelope all major spheres of social, cultural, economic and political life. However, discourses based on facts and artifacts of marginal and taboo spheres of social life prevail and become popular in a public space. Online mass media texts demonstrate the explication of "patriot" and "patriotism" concepts into deviant forms. The meaning of words is shifted into areas of social and cultural anomalies, and ironical and expressive neoderivates along with concepts with negative and ambivalent connotations appear. It is revealed that the first condition for derivates of "patriot" and "patriotism" concepts with negative semantics in a public lexicon is caused by specifics of mass media hypertexts circulation on the Internet (i.e. their instant distribution and sharing). The second condition seems to be the nature of media texts emergence with unexpected changes of meanings not caused by their initial semantics. The mechanism of this viral distribution of patriotic discourse derivates with ambivalent and negative semantics is based on a specific semiosis of conceptual metaphors used in connotation and blending of meanings. Metaphors from marginal subcultures and taboo spheres are brought into the sphere of spiritual culture and ideology. This way, oxymorons like "homosexual patriotism", "glamorous patriotism" and "trendy patriotism" are introduced into the public space. Expansion of such discourses has a manipulative effect, and the discourses dominate in a non-formal public communication. Traditionally, patriotism is one of the pillars of the spiritual culture of Russian society. Loss of this pillar in a confrontation with negative discourses is a major threat to a dynamic functioning of the society system.

J	Athanasiou, V; Maragoudakis, M				Athanasiou, Vasileios; Maragoudakis, Manolis			A Novel, Gradient Boosting Framework for Sentiment Analysis in Languages where NLP Resources Are Not Plentiful: A Case Study for Modern Greek	ALGORITHMS			English	Article						gradient boosting machines; sentiment analysis; high-dimensional data; Modern Greek	TRANSLATION	Sentiment analysis has played a primary role in text classification. It is an undoubted fact that some years ago, textual information was spreading in manageable rates; however, nowadays, such information has overcome even the most ambiguous expectations and constantly grows within seconds. It is therefore quite complex to cope with the vast amount of textual data particularly if we also take the incremental production speed into account. Social media, e-commerce, news articles, comments and opinions are broadcasted on a daily basis. A rational solution, in order to handle the abundance of data, would be to build automated information processing systems, for analyzing and extracting meaningful patterns from text. The present paper focuses on sentiment analysis applied in Greek texts. Thus far, there is no wide availability of natural language processing tools for Modern Greek. Hence, a thorough analysis of Greek, from the lexical to the syntactical level, is difficult to perform. This paper attempts a different approach, based on the proven capabilities of gradient boosting, a well-known technique for dealing with high-dimensional data. The main rationale is that since English has dominated the area of preprocessing tools and there are also quite reliable translation services, we could exploit them to transform Greek tokens into English, thus assuring the precision of the translation, since the translation of large texts is not always reliable and meaningful. The new feature set of English tokens is augmented with the original set of Greek, consequently producing a high dimensional dataset that poses certain difficulties for any traditional classifier. Accordingly, we apply gradient boosting machines, an ensemble algorithm that can learn with different loss functions providing the ability to work efficiently with high dimensional data. Moreover, for the task at hand, we deal with a class imbalance issues since the distribution of sentiments in real-world applications often displays issues of inequality. For example, in political forums or electronic discussions about immigration or religion, negative comments overwhelm the positive ones. The class imbalance problem was confronted using a hybrid technique that performs a variation of under-sampling the majority class and over-sampling the minority class, respectively. Experimental results, considering different settings, such as translation of tokens against translation of sentences, consideration of limited Greek text preprocessing and omission of the translation phase, demonstrated that the proposed gradient boosting framework can effectively cope with both high-dimensional and imbalanced datasets and performs significantly better than a plethora of traditional machine learning classification approaches in terms of precision and recall measures.

J	Ho, V				Ho, Victor			Guarding the gate politically and politely: How accreditation teams do facework while gatekeeping	JOURNAL OF POLITENESS RESEARCH-LANGUAGE BEHAVIOUR CULTURE			English	Article						accreditation; evaluation; face; facework; politeness	PROGRAMS; CHALLENGES; RAPPORT	Accreditation is a quality assurance mechanism which evaluates either the capability of an institution to offer an academic program or the quality of an academic program before its launch. Accredited institutions and programs are allowed to enroll students, both fee-paying and non-fee-paying. The outcome of an accreditation exercise will therefore have significant implications for an institution's reputation and finance. Institutions are normally informed of the outcome through an accreditation report, a genre whose discourse is intrinsically interesting and important, and thus deserves fuller research attention, for two reasons: (1) the genre contains evaluations and comments which can be negative and face-threatening, and (2) the accreditation team, as we can safely assume, will do facework subsequent to the performance of face threats through the negative evaluations and comments. The present study seeks to gain a better understanding of the lexicogrammar of this genre in general, and the lexicogrammar used to textualize facework in particular by analyzing the discourse of 30 accreditation reports in an Australian context. This paper argues that the evaluative language used in this genre can serve to perform facework for both the institution being accredited and the accreditation team itself, and have important implications for both the workplace and classroom.

J	Al-Shaikh, AR				Al-Shaikh, Abdul-Rahim			The Political Darwish "... In Defense of Little Differences"	JOURNAL OF ARABIC LITERATURE			English	Article						Mahmud Darwish; Palestine; al-Andalus; Troy; Arabic Poetry; Yasir 'Arafat; Jesus Christ; Native Americans; Colonialism; Exodus		Mahmud Darwish spent his life as a poet, a public intellectual, and a politician working "in defense of little differences," and he is often quoted by Palestinian compatriots to explain their seemingly inexplicable history. After the Nakbah of 1948-the rules of engagement in flux, and Palestinians subject to harsh colonial conditions-Eden, Troy, al-Andalus, and Exodus became not only terrains of metaphor and political rhetoric in Darwish's poetic lexica, but also fleeting heterotopias, heavily employed in his public intellectualism in constructing the phraseme of "little differences." This article is not a critical reading of Darwish's poetry but rather of his prose texts, and argues that the would-be dichotomy between aesthetics and politics was mediated by Darwish through the "little differences" between the roles of poetry and prose in defending national and universal causes; and the "little differences" that make up Palestine's relation to myth and history. Triumph and defeat come to mean through Troy as a metaphor for Palestine, the fall of al-Andalus standing in for Palestine's fall to Euro-Zionist colonial projects, the location of the Palestinian ever on the periphery of modern Jewish ethics, ever re-enacting Biblical scenes. Reading the polemics of such cultural landscapes and political geographies, this article maps Darwish's vision for justice in historic Palestine and its diaspora.

In the cyber world, a person can share his/her opinions and express his/her thoughts easily using different social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook. These shared opinions, comments and thoughts attract responses that can be very helpful to improve the thought process and can result in enhanced learning of participants. The dark side of the picture is that those responses and reactions can be very negative and sometimes this negativeness reach the level of cyberbullying. Just like real-world bullying, the cyberbullying has become a big problem in the world of social media and actions are needed to be taken to get rid of this ugly phenomenon. The aim of this paper is to explain the nature of challenge of cyberbullying. In order to handle this ugly phenomenon, this paper also discusses how machines can detect cyberbullying. In this context, the text mining approach and lexicon based approach to detect cyberbullying in Arabic text is discussed. The automatic detection of cyberbullying can help the government agencies to tackle the problem quickly thus making cyberspace secure and safer place for all segments of society.

A social robot is much more effective if it is able to learn and so take into account the properties of the humans around it, including personalities. We investigate how well personality can be estimated based on modest amounts of speech or writing, which a social robot might (over) hear. Such a technique also permits humans to be able to infer the personalities of other humans 'at a distance' based on their writing in political, hiring, negotiation, and other relationship settings. We design and implement a technique for predicting personality from small amounts of text, with accuracies comparable to inter-human agreement and substantially better than previous algorithmic approaches (except for a few that use much richer data). The technique works for both of the popular personality typologies, the Big Five and the Myers-Briggs. Because the approach does not require a lexicon, it is language independent. We illustrate using eight different languages, including Arabic.	[Alsadhan, N.; Skillicorn, D.

It has enabled people to keep in touch with each other anytime and anywhere around the globe. People share their opinions and experiences publically through such platforms. Twitter is one of the significant social networking platform that is used by many news media to disseminate breaking news instantaneously. Sentiment analysis of social media is successfully used to gain insights regarding collective behavior of the society. In addition, sentiment analysis is used to detect positive or negative content posted on the social media for various purposes such as riots detection. In this paper, we focus on the sentiment analysis of news tweets in Urdu language by major news sources in Pakistan. By gathering tweets data over the period of 10 months, we built a sentiment lexicon in Urdu language. Moreover, we devise an algorithm that classifies Urdu text into positive, negative, or neutral classes based on the cumulative sentiment score of the text. Our sentiment analysis algorithm achieves 77% accuracy. Furthermore, we have done perspective analysis in which we estimated the bias in the news reporting through tweets with respect to the government with 77.45% accuracy.

J	Buljan, I				Buljan, Ivana			From Language to Thought: Unreal Conditionals and Counterfactual Thinking in Early China	FILOZOFSKA ISTRAZIVANJA			Croatian	Article						counterfactual reasoning; classical Chinese philosophy; Old Chinese language; Confucius; Mencius; Zhuangzi; Zuo zhuan		Counterfactual reasoning - the construction of mental alternatives to reality - is an important part of theoretical thinking. In this kind of reasoning, which is expressed through the use of unreal conditional sentences, i.e. statements such as "if it were not for X, there would be no Y", a hypothesis is established on the basis of an action/state/event that did not happen. An unfulfilled condition or cause from the past or present is connected with a potential effect. Thus, counterfactual reasoning is important in the formation of ethical/political and scientific reflections. While conducting empirical research, Alfred Bloom concluded that Chinese speakers are not inclined to counterfactual reasoning. Bloom links this with a deficit in equivalent grammatical markers for unreal conditionality in the modern standard Chinese language. Bloom shows that the modern Chinese language has no extricated lexical, grammatical, or tonal markers for counterfactuality. This paper will examine Bloom's thesis in the area of the Old Chinese language and classical Chinese texts. Research will be carried out on two levels. On the first, linguistic level, it will be determined if there are unreal conditional constructions in Old Chinese. On the second, discursive level, the presence/absence and rhetorical role of counterfactual thinking in classical Chinese philosophical and historical texts will be examined. Consideration of the relationship between the grammatical structures of the Old Chinese language and counterfactual reasoning will contribute to an understanding of the nature of classical Chinese philosophical thought and the relationship between the Old Chinese language and thinking, especially regarding the issue of the extent to which the formation of a specific thinking/philosophy is conditioned by the morphosyntactic structures of the language it is built upon. Secondly, due to the importance of counterfactual reasoning in the formation of theoretical thinking, this research provides additional insight into the "predispositions" of the Old Chinese language towards the formation of philosophical and scientific discourse.

ASSESSING TRANSLATION QUALITY	NOVYI FILOLOGICHESKII VESTNIK-NEW PHILOLOGICAL BULLETIN			English	Article						comparative translation discourse analysis (CTDA); connotative meaning; contamination; denotative meaning; domestication/naturalization; expert translator; foreignization; lexical/text; pragmatics neutralization; stylization; theories of the middle range; translation studies		English-language reviews of translations of prose fiction are dominated by a "belletristic" approach whereby the artistic features of the translation text are assessed with little reference to its original. Such an approach fails to provide an adequate evaluation of the merits, drawbacks or "losses" in the translation under review. The author of the article offers a method of concrete comparative translation discourse analysis (CTDA) of originals and their translations based on their specific lexical, structural-communicative, stylistic, pragmatic, and sociocultural properties. At the lexical level, the objects of comparison of the original text and its translation are the following elements of denotative and connotative meaning: denotation -(1) denotative word-sense core; (2) denotative word-sense periphery; connotation - the "emotive charge" of the sense core, including (3) the nature of emotion and (4) its intensity; (5) the evaluative connotation of the word-sense ("the author's attitude"); (6) functional style reference; (7) dialectal reference (temporal/generational, regional, and sociocultural); (8) comparative frequency of occurrence in a particular functional style; (9) word-sense pragmatics (word-sense comparative "metaphoricity," its "political correctness," "cumbersomeness" and some other features). At the predication level (sentence and clause), it is possible to single out 5-7 key (constant) syntactic and communicative "discrepancies" between Russian and English, which get rendered in either language with the help of 5-7 constant translation models. The assessment of the overall pragmatics of the translation text consists in determining the degrees of the neutralization, "domestication" ("naturalization"/localization), "contamination," "foreignization," and stylization of the original text. The comprehensive "impression" of the quality of a translation in the mind of the translation analyst, based on the analyses at the three levels (lexical, predication, and pragmatic), constitutes the tertium comparationis of the proposed analytical approach. Given the relative "fuzziness" and variance in individual perceptions of textual meaning, the categories of analysis and assessment proposed in this article are not absolute, belonging as they do to the qualitative methods of comparative translation studies. The article contains examples illustrating the author's conceptual framework.

In translating the Iliad and the Odyssey, Hobbes had to handle a lexicon imbued with expressions that linked men in power to the Olympian gods. Unfortunately, the existence of these ties was completely at odds with what he had previously explained in his political works; hence he had to work on it extensively. By starting from a lexical analysis and moving to the dimension of History of Political Ideas, the article will show how Hobbes bypasses this problem, in order to reach his political and educational target.

An important place amongst them, as a valuable source for the study of language in Istria of the socialist period, was held by the Uljanik, the magazine of the eponymous Pula shipyard, which was published in Pula from 1954 to 1990. This paper analyses the orthographical, morphological, syntactical, word-formational, lexical and stylistic features of the magazine, which are then compared to the normative rules of the handbooks and other publications with the aim to determine the extent to which the language of the Uljanik was in accord with the norm of the period. The analysis of all the features provides insight into the real situation of the language and orthography and evaluates the influence of the language policy and its tendencies on the language of the media in Istria in this period. A special emphasis is put on stylistic characteristics which are susceptible to the influence of the political expression in this type of texts. In addition, a content analysis of the articles has been carried out in the attempt to see how much language problems were discussed among workers.

J	Dickins, T				Dickins, Tom			The Political Slogan in Communist Czechoslovakia (1948-89)	CENTRAL EUROPE			English	Article						Czechoslovakia; political slogan; Communism; speech act theory; Searle; Austin; corpus-analysis		This article employs an interdisciplinary approach to evaluate the role of the political slogan in Communist Czechoslovakia, with reference to Bakhtin's concept of hierarchically superior texts, as developed by Alexei Yurchak and Michal Pullmann. It argues that the slogan performed a much wider range of temporally specific functions than has been generally recognized, and that its repetitive and ritualistic character had a major psychological effect on people's memory and perception of reality (see C. Atkinson and R.M. Shiffrin, and David I. Kertzer). A clear distinction is drawn between denotative and connotative meaning, with detailed attention paid to J.L. Austin's speech act theory, as elaborated by John R. Searle. The first two sections of the article define the concept and the functions of the 'political slogan', with special significance accorded to the use of language to establish a binary opposition between 'us' and 'them' (a la John B. Thompson's notion of fragmentation). The third part identifies the sources and methodology adopted, and lists the principal word tokens identified. Following a brief contextualization of the slogan in the next section, the main body of the study uses corpus-assisted statistical analysis to evaluate the development of different thematic, lexical and semantic referents over three broad time spans (1948 to the mid-1950s, the mid-1950s to 1968, and 1969 to 1989).

Yet, analysing sentiments in Arabic texts has not been explored much in the extant literature. In this paper, we present a new tool that applies sentiment analysis to Arabic text tweets using a combination of parameters. Those parameters are (1) the time of the tweets, (2) preprocessing methods like stemming and retweets, (3) n-grams features, (4) lexicon-based methods, and (5) machine-learning methods. Users can select a topic and set their desired parameters. The model detects the polarity (negative, positive, both, and neutral) of the topic from the recent related tweets and display the results. The tool is trained with 8000 randomly selected and evenly-labelled Arabic tweets. Our experiments show that the Naive Bayes machine-learning approach is the most accurate in predicting topic polarity. The tool is useful for intermediate and expert users and can help guide them in choosing the best combinations of parameters for sentiment analysis. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

J	Fenwick, L				Fenwick, Lisl			The effects of discourses in regional contexts on the development of curriculum-based literacy standards for adolescents in schooling: a comparative study of South Australia and Ontario	CURRICULUM JOURNAL			English	Article						Competencies; curriculum development; curriculum theory; government policy; international comparison	LARGE-SCALE; NO CHILD; POLICY; FRAMEWORK; EQUITY	This study analyses how discourses in regional contexts affect the development of curriculum-based literacy standards for adolescents in schooling. A comparative case-study research design enabled the influences of discourses at the regional level to be analysed. The case studies include the development of curricula to define a minimum literacy standard for the final years of schooling for adolescents in Ontario, Canada, and South Australia, Australia. Critical discourse analysis of key texts associated with the development of literacy standards in each region reveals how globally shared meanings about standard setting for schooling interact with other discourses operating in local contexts to produce curricula that define literacy standards. The results indicate that, while a global discourse about standards-based reforms may be foregrounded in curriculum, locally generated discourses can challenge key ideas associated with a simplistic discourse about standards. Discourses about literacy in Ontario and South Australia contest the assertion that literacy at the end point of schooling can be defined as a basic competency and local meanings associated with literacy are emphasised within the curriculum for each location. Language choices, involving particularly lexical cohesion, complex noun groups and nominalisation, are used to ensure that local meanings inform literacy standards for the endpoint of schooling.

C	Fonseca, A; Sadat, F; Lareau, F		Mitkov, R		Fonseca, Alexsandro; Sadat, Fatiha; Lareau, Francois			Combining Dependency Parsing and a Lexical Network Based on Lexical Functions for the Identification of Collocations	COMPUTATIONAL AND CORPUS-BASED PHRASEOLOGY, EUROPHRAS 2017	Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence		English	Proceedings Paper	2nd International Conference on Computational and Corpus-Based Phraseology - Recent Advances and Interdisciplinary Approaches (Europhras)	NOV 13-14, 2017	London, ENGLAND	European Assoc Phraseol, Univ Wolverhampton, Res Inst Informat & Language Processing, Sketch Engine, European Language Resources Assoc, Univ Wolverhampton		Meaning-Text Theory; Lexical function; Collocation identification; Dependency parsing; Lexical network		A collocation is a type of multiword expression formed by two parts: a base and a collocate. Usually, in a collocation, the base has a denotative or literal meaning, while the collocate has a connotative meaning. Examples of collocations: pay attention, easy as pie, strongly condemn, lend support, etc. The Meaning-Text Theory created the lexical functions to, among other objectives, represent the meaning existing between the base and the collocate or to represent the relation between the base and a support verb. For example, the lexical function Magn represents the meaning intensification, while the lexical function Caus, applied to a base, returns the support verb that represents the causality of the action expressed in the collocation. In a dependency parsing, each word (dependent) is directly associated with its governor in a phrase. In this paper, we show how we combine dependency parsing to extract collocation candidates and a lexical network based on lexical functions to identify the true collocations from the candidates. The candidates are extracted from a French corpus according to 14 dependency relations. The collocations identified are classified according to the semantic group of the lexical functions modeling them. We obtained a general precision (for all dependency types) of 76.3%, with a precision higher than 95% for collocations having certain dependency relations. We also found that about 86% of collocations identified belong to only four semantic categories: qualification, support verb, location and action/event.

J	Garrido, J				Garrido, Joaquin			Discourse segmentation and interaction	CIRCULO DE LINGUISTICA APLICADA A LA COMUNICACION			Spanish	Article						discourse segmentation; discourse units; journalistic column; political cartoon; text interaction; topic structure		In discourse segmentation, discourse units are based on dependance and constituency, and they incorporate properties of units in other approaches such as the utterance and the act. Elementary discourse units establish discourse relations by virtue of their topic sentence structure. Framing and hanging topics, as well as parenthetical expressions, fall ouside of the inner sentence topic hierarchy of aboutness-shifting, contrastive and familiar topics. It is shown in the interaction of a political cartoon and a journalistic column how elementary units build up complex ones, including both properties of discourse relations and properties of topic management and the represented lexical frames, in a dynamic discourse-construction model that assumes syntactic continuity from sentence to discourse. Higher units involve interaction between participants according to the type of text, such as the political cartoon or the column. It is further shown how text structure affects discourse: depending on positions of lexical units in text structure, lexical relations may override the results of the discourse construction process and thus the resulting discourse representations.

RUSSKAYA PRAVDA: SEMANTIC VARIATION OF THE TITLE IN TEXTUAL CONTEXT	VESTNIK VOLGOGRADSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA-SERIYA 2-YAZYKOZNANIE			Russian	Article						Russkaya Pravda; chronicle; Merilo Pravednoye; Old Russian text; semantic syncretism; lexical meaning; sense; connotation		The article presents its authors' reflections on various reasons for cultural heterogeneity in understanding the title of a well-known Old Russian manuscript on justice Russkaya Pravda. The authors study the etymological roots and meaning of the word pravda ('truth'), its semantic ties with some other word forms that were derived from the common root in the Old Russian language. Taking into account such feature of the word pravda as semantic syncretism, the authors show that this lexeme denotes qualities (justice, truth, innocence), an action that is aimed at establishing the truth in conformity with Holy truth, and a law that governs the actions. Since Russkaya Pravda used to be a constituent of some larger manuscripts (chronicles, legal and other compilations), the authors state its place in the structure of Merilo Pravednoye or ('measure of righteousness') (14th cen.) and in the Novgorod First Chronicle (Commission Scroll, 15th cen.). The article also reveals semantic peculiarities of the titles of these compilations, other legislative texts included in them along with Russkaya Pravda (statute, law and others), as well as synonymous nominations of Russkaya Pravda (regulations, court of justice) in their correlation with the word pravda ('truth'). The authors make conclusion that the semantic constituency of the studied lexemes, reflecting the Russians' representations about the world that create sustained connotations and associations and form the essence of the title Russkaya Pravda.

Court biographies, popular lexicons, and the letters sent from the Mughal court to its Rajput allies reveal that the fabrics used for dress in early modern South Asia were valued for sensory qualities, such as softness, saturation of color, and coolness on the skin, that went beyond the cost of the materials or the sophistication of the technology used to produce them. This project transports the study of dress in early modern South Asia beyond its current focus on the material wealth of imperial costumes to recover the sensory experience of wearing airy cotton and velvety wool, as well as the sophisticated intellectual, poetic, and political messages that could be carried in the fabric of a courtly coat.

Previous works exploring political framing typically analyze frame usage in longer texts, such as congressional speeches. We present a collection of weakly supervised models which harness collective classification to predict the frames used in political discourse on the microblogging platform, Twitter. Our global probabilistic models show that by combining both lexical features of tweets and network-based behavioral features of Twitter, we are able to increase the average, unsupervised F-1 score by 21.52 points over a lexical baseline alone.

J	Juric, TS				Juric, Teuta Serreqi			THE IDEA OF GOD'S PROVIDENCE AND THE INFLUENCE OF THE HOLY SCRIPTURE AS REFLECTED IN PORPHYROGENITUS' VITA BASILII	FLUMINENSIA			Croatian	Article						Vita Basilii; Basil I; God's providence; biblical quotes; biblical exempla; biblical metaphors		The Christian idea of Providence is quite conventional in Byzantine literature and it is not surprising that it is present in Vita Bas., the biography of Emperor Basil I, Porphyrogenitus' grandfather, in which we also find a strong influence of the Holy Scripture. Taking into account the author's frequent references to the mentioned idea, in this paper we aim to examine the relationship between the emphasis of the idea of Providence and the influence of the Holy Scripture, as well as to answer the question of why Porphyrogenitus constantly stresses the importance of divine providence throughout Basil's life if the Byzantines perceived emperors as appointed by God himself. Our research has shown that the author, wishing to support the idea that God's will played a key role in every aspect of Basil's life, used the Holy Scripture as a source from which he extracted quotes or lexical and phraseological parallels and incorporated them into the descriptions of important moments in Basil's life in order to present his grandfather as a pious man, obedient to God's will, which consequently led him to the throne. Additionally, he aimed to describe Basil's personal traits, more precisely, justice, piety and mercy, as Christian virtues which marked his politics, as well as to highlight his sobriety and prudence in the face of most difficult family circumstances, one of which was surely the death of his son Constantine. With the same intention the author used the exempla when comparing Basil to the biblical figures of Samson, Abraham and the father from the Parable of the prodigal son, or biblical metaphors of the storm and the shepherd and his flock, when illustrating the dangers of war and depicting Basil as a ruler. Although the use of quotes and stylistic devices usually follows the rhetorical conventions of a given period of time and genre standards, and in this case the genre we are dealing with is an encomium written in honour of a Byzantine emperor, the mutual connection between the emphasis of the idea of Providence and the biblical elements that are used cannot be denied. The fact that, if these were lacking, the specified idea would not possess such expressive and aesthetic strength as it does in this panegyric biography, undoubtedly confirms that the author included parts of the Holy Scripture into his narrative not only in order to achieve the exalted stylistic expression, but also to realize his ideological intention throughout the text, which was obviously to whitewash the reputation of his grandfather as the founder of the Macedonian dynasty. Motivated by this desire, instead of denying Basil's involvement in the murders of Cesar Bardas and Emperor Michael III, the author portrays his grandfather as a pious and moral man (which is consistent with Christian principles), whose accession to the throne was ordained by God's will, and not a consequence of his immoral acts or great ambition.

VIDONIMS AS A MEANS OF GIVING A NEGATIVE ASSESSMENT TO NEWSPAPER TEXTS	PSYCHOLINGUISTICS			Ukrainian	Article						vidonims; emotionally expressive vocabulary; language of mass media; extralinguistic factors; negative evaluation		The article examines the use in the language of modern Ukrainian periodicals vidonim words to provide texts with expressive and emotional coloration, which, however, often have negative marking. The appearance in newspapers of such lexical units indicates the intensification of the print media development and the need to inform about news from different fields of life, politics, culture. It was found that the largest group of vidonims make derivatives from anthroponyms, in particular from surnames. It was found that this is due to a number of extralinguistic factors including some political processes in the country. Vidonims had been classified by the method of creation and the area of use. It was discovered that the appearance of vidonim units was caused by a desire of speakers to name figuratively this or that phenomenon, effect, transfer meaning shades or expression, to express which in Ukrainian literary language there are no special tools. The study found that the beginning of the XXI-st century is characterized by the active use of vidonim units for negative characteristic of people, processes and conditions that take place in the life of the country. Mainly they are using for political texts, sometimes in the texts on military topics.

Information from public complaints can be used by the government to improve public satisfaction. In addition, the government can obtain public sentiment from public complaints either on media social or the official government site. Many kinds of research on sentiment analysis have been done, either used statistical method approach, semantic method approach or both. Statistical method approach was widely used. While semantic method approach being the hot topic recently. On semantic method approach, lexical resource was an important component to classify sentiment on text. Namely Sentiwordnet and Indonesian sentiment lexicon. Currently, Indonesian lexical resources for sentiment analysis has grown. But the lexicon doesn't have polarity score that can be measure emotion on text like Sentiwordnet. Sentiwordnet has been widely used on research in English. In this research, we apply Sentiwordnet to classify sentiment on Indonesian public complaints with accuracy 47% either on media Twitter and 56.85% on the official government website's data. Furthermore, we compare it with Indonesian sentiment lexical and get the accuracy 65.4% on media Twitter and 81.4% on the official government website	[Lailiyah, M.; Sumpeno, S.; Purnama, I. K.

The analysis has included three features, they are the diction, the sentence sturucture, and the language style. The fourth aspect to be considered is the students reponse in understanding the imperative utterances in the textbook. Students make the most of they can, or their effort, to get to know about the lesson activity, and the lesson activity "requires" or asks them to do. By the results and discussion for the four research questions, it can be concluded that the imperative utterances written by the writers of this textbook do really help the teaching and learning, using 2013 Curriculum approach. Besides its sentences writing which are varied and efficient, the textbook imperative utterances diction, sentence structure, and language style are of features that make the imperative utterances practical and understandable to the students. In challenge of the students to be "very" active" or responsible, in 2013 Curriculum teaching and learning, the textbook give positive value to the students, in the way its imperative utterances are efficient, which are is formal English for 2013 Curriculum Indonesian EFL teaching and learning. The students has given response toward the imperative utterances implementation during their learning time, to support the analysis of the diction, sentence structure, and language style. By a structured interview to ask for their comments and opinions, the students of X IPA 3 and X IPA 4 give positive response in two meetings of lessons. They give comments that the diction, sentence structure, and language style that they notice by simply "reading" of these imperative utterances are of efficient formal English language imperative.

The article shows how the authors of these textbooks change the discursive practices of global English to suit their own purposes. In particular, the article discusses how the authors appropriate the genre structure of biographical texts and adapt lexico-grammatical resources for identity management. An appropriation of the language in the textbooks, the article argues, curtails students' access to the linguistic or semiotic tools that are needed to read and engage with other globally oriented texts. This may impact students' views of the world as well as limit their ability to understand and appreciate alternative perspectives.

Concentrating on two agents that foreground these alterities, the soldier who refuses' and the refugee', the article disaggregates this region's heterotopias. The argument is that, in their walking away from civil wars in East Africa to Southern Africa, these subjects provide an original set of lexical items to interpret new but fragile peoples who break free from the nation state.At the same time, the unique grammar broadens the methodology for considering the Indian Ocean' as a topic that recurs in studies on East Africa. In this reading, the discussion works with the cultural studies concept of walking', as its politics of terra firma centres on guerrilla tactics and on how they weaken the postcolony.The first part of the article attempts a review of the cartographies of East Africa.The second section closely considers how the representations of these sets of heterotopias in select fiction on East Africa render this region transnational.

RUSSKAYA PRAVDA: PECULIARITIES OF TEXT PERCEPTION IN THE WEST	VESTNIK VOLGOGRADSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA-SERIYA 2-YAZYKOZNANIE			Russian	Article						Russkaya Pravda; comparative analysis; legislative discourse; annotated translation; translation difficulties		Thearticle deals with a review of studies of the most famous and important papers of European and American researchers devoted to Russkaya Pravda (also translated into English as "Russian Justice" or "Russian Truth"), i.e. monumental legal text of Ancient Russia. The authors represent the opinions of German, British, American and French scholars, historians and lawyers in the first place, whose studies involve primarily a comparative text analysis of the Russkaya Pravda with the law systems in other countries of that period (Germanic, Swedish, Anglo-Saxon and Frankish law). The article shows that the researchers analyze the influence of foreign legal traditions on the Russkaya Pravda (e.g. Scandinavian influence from the point of view of political relations). It demonstrates some scholars attempt to determine what Russkaya Pravda is: "local customary law" or the embodiment of "princely law". A number of studies offer evidence of the evolution of justice in Russia by comparing the text of the "Russian Truth" with the later monuments of the legislative discourse, which reflect a shift towards greater social justice. The few philological works carry out terminological analysis based on the interpretation of the translation: the groups of lexical elements are identified, which are most difficult for adequate translation, since they reflect the realities of life in the medieval period in the Russian history; the ways to interpret this vocabulary are suggested.

J	Morales Moreno, A				Morales Moreno, Albert			The vocabulary marking the process of reform and approval of the text of the Autonomy Statute of Catalonia (2006)	TREBALLS DE SOCIOLINGUISTICA CATALANA			Catalan	Article						lexicometry; lexicology; autonomy statute; discourse analysis; legislative discourse		In 2006, after a drawn-out parliamentary process, the Autonomy Statute of Catalonia (ASC) was approved. The Spanish Constitutional Court Ruling 31/2010 would later declare it partly unconstitutional. Morales (2008) already examined the statutory frameworks drafted by the parliamentary groups and this paper now presents a study of the three versions of the ASC agreed on in the Catalan Parliament. These texts are marked by discursive characteristics typically found in legal and political discourse and belong to a genre - legislative discourse - which has remained under-researched in Catalan linguistics in recent years. Using textual statistics and a lexicometric analysis conducted with Lexico3, this study demonstrates how lexical choices shifted over the course of the process of drafting and approving the ASC of 2006. Based on lexicometric criteria and discursive analysis, this paper describes the vocabulary used in this process. It also puts forward the theoretical and methodological approaches used for this research and describes the four types of amendments identified.

THE PECULIARITIES OF TRANSLATION OF THE POLITICALLY CORRECT VOCABULARY	QUID-INVESTIGACION CIENCIA Y TECNOLOGIA			English	Article						translation; sociolinguistics; language; translation; political correctness; euphemisms; race; subject of the activity; student		The article presents the results of a study of the problem of translating politically correct vocabulary from English into Russian in the context of sociolinguistics. Political correctness is the practice of introducing a language policy, called upon to make changes in the lexical language system to influence the consciousness of its native speakers. The research method included the analysis of publicist texts and their translation into Russian. We translated four articles from English into Russian containing politically correct vocabulary. The experimental work was carried out on the website of the news media company BuzzFeed and on the anti-racist websites. Based on this analysis, we singled out the features of politically correct vocabulary relating to the human race, in the English language, its differences from this vocabulary in Russian, and, therefore, the peculiarities of its translation into Russian. As a research result, we found the productive ways of translating the politically correct vocabulary. We identified the potential difficulties encountered by professionals in the translation process. The materials of the article can be useful in the practice of linguists, translators, philologists, sociolinguists, sociologists, and students. The article has special significance for the activists of human rights protection organizations when working with English-language theoretical materials of anti-racist orientation.

The automatic mapping of relevant documents stands out as an important application for automatic questions-documents classification strategies. This paper presents a contribution to the identification concepts in text comprehension in unstructured documents as an important step towards clarifying the role of explicit concepts in information retrieval in general. The most common representational scheme in text categorization is the Bag of Words approach when the dictionary, as incorporating background knowledge, is large. The authors introduce a new approach to create conceptbased text representations, and apply it to a text categorization collection to create predefined classes in the case of short text document analysis problem. Further in this paper, a classification-based algorithm for questions matching topic modelling is presented. The paper also describes the weighting of concepts that present terms with high frequency of occurrence in questions is based on their similarity relevance in the predefined classes of documents. The results of the experiment within the criminal law domain in the present case study show that the performance of concept-based text representations has proven to be satisfactory in the case when there is no dictionary for this domain.

J	O'Grady, G				O'Grady, Gerard			"I think" in political speech	INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF PRAGMATICS			English	Article						political speech; discourse markers; prosody; intonation; intonational prominence	DISCOURSE; BELIEVE	Simon-Vandenbergen (2000: 61) concluded her study of I think in political discourse by noting the importance of further study of its prosodic realisation. Consequently, I investigate the prosodic realisations of I think in political debates. At the same time, I examine the lexico-grammatical form of the construction, and its surrounding co-text. My exploration confirmed that I think is frequent in political speech, and revealed that it projected four types of meanings. Three of the meanings occurred irrespective of the intonational choices, though prosody influenced the likelihood of the occurrence of a particular meaning. There was a greater likelihood of the speaker expressing a tentative statement if think was prominent/tonic. Intonational prominence on I explicitly warranted the source of the evaluation. When the construction did not contain an intonational prominence it tended to signal commitment to a proposition, or if followed by a filled pause or rhythmic disjunction a hesitation marker.

Bengali WordNet, developed at ISI Kolkata has been used as a knowledge base and the input data set is prepared from the Bengali Text Corpus developed in the TDIL (Technology Development for Indian Language) project of the Government of India. The proposed approach resolute the exact sense of a Bengali ambiguous word based on the maximum overlap among the dictionary definitions of the ambiguous word, with its collocating words in that sentence and the synonymous words of these collocating words. The algorithm is tested on 9 (nine) mostly used Bengali ambiguous words. The accuracy of the output is achieved 75% which is verified by an expert. The challenges and the pitfalls of this approach are discussed in this report in detail.

FUNCTIONAL AND STYLISTIC ROLE OF NOUNS-OCCASIONALISMS IN THE LANGUAGE OF UKRAINIAN PERIODICALS AT THE BEGINNING OF THE XXI CENTURY	PSYCHOLINGUISTICS			Ukrainian	Article						occasionalism; speech; neologism; lexical unit; linguistic norms; ways of word formation		The article examines the use of nouns-occasionalisms in the language of media at the XXI century. The specific use of occasionalisms has been outlined on the base of print periodicals examples and explanation of their meaning has been made. It is noted that usually the studied vocabulary has a negative-evaluative nature. This article provides a brief analysis of Ukrainian linguists' studies on the functioning of the occasionalisms in the Ukrainian language. It has been concluded that nouns-occasionalisms are formed by using existing in our language words or phrases, and they often break the language norms; it has been found out that occasionalisms differ from neologisms by the number of features, in particular, neologisms are lexical units of language and speech, and occasionalisms are only speech ones; the author's presence is not essential for neologisms, but it is essential for occasionalisms and so on. It has been investigated that occasionalisms are used in different thematic groups, most often in the articles, which describe the political events in our country, relations between Ukraine and Russia, as well as events from the sphere of culture. It has been generalized that occasionalisms are used intentionally in many journalistic articles so that to give emotional and expressive colour to a text.

CROSS-LANGUAGE CODE CONVERTION: FUNCTIONALLY SEMANTIC AND STYLISTIC ASPECTS	VESTNIK VOLGOGRADSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA-SERIYA 2-YAZYKOZNANIE			Russian	Article						cross-language code conversion; Russism; French newspapers; semantic classification; functional aspect; stylistic device		The article is devoted to the problem of cross-language interaction in mass media; in particular, the author chooses lexical items that have been linguistically converted from Russian into French forms as a specific object of research. In the focus of attention is the process of foreign word penetration into another language and stating peculiarities in the usage of code converted Russian words in modern French press. The cross-language code converted word items are grouped in accordance with a semantic criterion that is based on V.S. Vinogradov's classification, their contextual environment analysis points to specificity of their functions in media texts. The semantic classification of the cross-language code converted lexical items is viewed as correlating with the variety of semantic functions, including nominative, informative, terminological as well as the functions of text exotization or national culture specification. The author concludes that social and political items are majoring and perform the widest range of the functions, the least numerous is a groups of items that nominate natural world phenomena. It is stated that cross-language item code conversion serves for presenting substantive or specifically cultural content of the message, it is used as an expressive language means with a shade of stylistic potential, which is supported with a set of examples and their stylistic interpretations.

J	Reid, P				Reid, Pauline			Image and illusion in Francis Quarles's emblems and pamphlets: duplication, duality, duplicity	WORD & IMAGE			English	Article						perception; rhetoric; print; duplication	'EMBLEMES'	In the seventeenth-century dictionary The Gate of Languages Unlocked, Johann Comenius describes "Gravers cutting most curious little images in brass, and imprinting them on paper," under a section called "The Delights of the Eyes." These curious shapes, engraved on brass or copper plates, formed a new illustration technique in seventeenth-century prints. Engravings were reproduced in print through the duplication and reversal of their visual forms. In Francis Quarles's Emblemes ( 1633) and political pamphlets, a pattern of replication and inversion appears throughout their poetic texts, engraved illustrations, and philosophical concerns. This pattern portrays the visual reading process as unsettled. In a culture where visual species, or replicas of images and objects, were thought potentially to mediate and transform what was seen, where diabolical influences interfered with the human senses, and where new visual marvels in astronomy and aesthetics were displayed and contested, visual observation was an ambivalent sensation that could alternately divine truths and deceive observers. This article will explore Quarles's and his collaborator William Marshall's use of rhetorical tropes, such as chiasmus, paradox, and mimesis, and references to visual technologies, such as glass prisms, " fool's paradises," optical glasses, and telescopes, as well as engraving itself, to interrogate vision in the context of the popular illustrated print. In the works of Quarles, these crises and marvels of visual culture create a sense of duplicity, as readers become lured by sensual visions and optical illusions.										53	0	0	0	2	ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD	ABINGDON	2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND	0266-6286	1943-2178		WORD IMAGE	Word Image		2017	33	1					70	86		10.1080/02666286.2016.1259437			17	Humanities, Multidisciplinary	Arts &amp; Humanities Citation Index (A&amp;HCI)	Arts & Humanities - Other Topics	EO5HP	WOS:000396724300005					2022-03-30

COMPLEX DIDACTIC REPRESENTATION OF VERBAL INTERCULTURAL COMMUNICATION "RUSSIA-CHINA"	PHILOLOGICAL CLASS			Russian	Article						speaking; teaching package; intercultural communication; textbook; tests; workbook; Chinese students; Russian as a foreign language		The article reviews a new teaching package "Stylistics, Standard of Speech and Translation Practice" for Chinese students learning Russian in non-native language environment. The article describes the package, which includes a textbook, tests in speaking, tests in translation from Chinese into Russian, a reader and a workbook. This article underlines that the urgency of this teaching package is determined by the necessity of development and perfection of teaching materials to form communicative competence of Chinese students in four activities in Russian - productive (speaking and writing) and reproductive (listening and reading). There is no doubt that Chinese language native speakers should be acquainted with all the levels of the Russian language, including communication in business, scientific, everyday and publicistic discourses. The article presents a description of the teaching package, the first part of which is a textbook that includes theoretical and practical material in all the four types of language activities, as well as the resources for translation practice and mistakes correction. The second part is a book of tests in translation from Chinese into Russian; each test correlates with a certain part of the textbook; these tests check lexico-grammatical and stylistic aspects of translations. The third part of the package is a reader to form reproductive language skills (listening and reading); it includes political, cultural, and publicistic texts that describe different spheres of Russian life. The workbook has the same units as the textbook and it develops skills in writing, translation, and mistakes correction to develop productive language skills. Moreover the article describes two units of the textbook in detail ("Reading" and "Writing"). It pays special attention to the features of intercultural material and tasks, which make the basis for good speaking skills formation.	[Ruzhentseva, N. B.; Nakhimova, E.

They calculate the overall sentiment of texts by using a general collection of words, with predetermined sentiment orientation and strength. However, words' sentiment often vary with the contexts in which they appear, and new words might be encountered that are not covered by the lexicon, particularly in social media environments where content emerges and changes rapidly and constantly. In this paper, we propose a lexicon adaptation approach that uses contextual as well as semantic information extracted from DBPedia to update the words' weighted sentiment orientations and to add new words to the lexicon. We evaluate our approach on three different Twitter datasets, and show that enriching the lexicon with contextual and semantic information improves sentiment computation by 3.4% in average accuracy, and by 2.8% in average F1 measure.

By conducting a historical ethnography to trace how different authors contributed to the policy text, and examining these contributions against political shifts and the dynamics of the media discourse surrounding the policy, and by collecting accounts from key actors through interviews, the paper presents a detailed reconstruction of the process of drafting the strategy. The analysis uncovers an on-going struggle between different groups of Slovene linguists to secure their own interests, and finds that political shifts enabled different groups to shift wordings within the document in their own favour.

Starting from an anti-essentialist perspective, which holds that language differences between men and women speakers are much less extensive than claimed in the past, we analysed 463 parliamentary speeches in the course of the XIVth legislature (5-2001 / 4-2006) in four parliamentarian pairs, differentiated by gender and political orientation. The general aim was to explore the socio-psychological constructs of agency and ingroup/outgroup dynamics as revealed by linguistic behaviour in men/women parliamentarians. The two constructs were detected by specific linguistic markers in the interventions of men/women parliamentarian pairs. Specifically, for agency, we detected : (1a) pronoun variations between singular and plural first person (I, We); (1b) amplitude of We as either specific or superordinate; (1c) conditional modal form of verbs. For ingroup/outgroup dynamics, we detected : (2a) pronoun variation between first and second plural person (We vs. You) and (2b) their valence. Lexicographical analysis was carried out with statistical packages TaLTaC2 and TreeTagger on a corpus of 432,671 words. Chi-square and z-test were applied to word frequencies, while Student's t-tests were applied to gender comparisons. The results showed reduced variability between men/women parliamentarians in the use of linguistic devices, confirming the weakness of the essentialist and binary logic that has long dominated the field of studies on language and gender.

The research materials are the military charters of the middle and the end of the 18th century, which are kept in the Fund "Mikhaylovskiy stanichnyy ataman" of the State archive of Volgograd region. Similarities and differences in the expression of text subject in the charters of different time slices are established. It is shown that the similarity is manifested in the naming of "collective" subject by lexical units designating officials and indicating his name and status, population of persons and their status, in using linguistic means forming the imperative tone of the document. It is argued that the differences are related to the use of performatives and verbal forms of the past tense, indicating the legal actions of the subject of the text, the personal and possessive pronouns, lexical units that name the institution that performs certain managerial functions, names of places, localizing the subject of the text. It is revealed that changes in the composition and usage of language means, which reveal the subject of military charters, reflect opposite tendencies - to the individualization of the subject and the objectivity of the document text that are caused by the development of the administrative governance within the Province of the Don Cossack Host and by the formation of new functional paradigm of the Russian language.

IDENTITY, NATION AND DIALOGUE: LANGUAGE AND DISCOURSE			Unspecified	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Globalization, Intercultural Dialogue and National Identity	MAY 18, 2017	Tirgu Mures, ROMANIA			information overflow; linguistic cliche; TV crawlers; television news; graphic elements		In the context of a society increasingly marked by forms of fluidity and dynamism, television, subject to the pressure of the new digital media, struggles to align itself to the values of the so-called liquid modernity and fluid journalism (Bauman 2000, 2005; Bivens 2014), to adapt to the, physiognomy" of the contemporary society, marked by vectors of postmodern velocity (globalization, mobility, self-affirmation of the individual through multiple, flexible identities, acceleration of time and condensation of space through technology, etc.). In order to cope with the overflow of information and to perform the function of providing viewers the maximum amount of information in the shortest possible time, television is constantly updating its graphic elements. Thus, television news and talk show programs have embedded crawlers or news tickers as multiple strips of text scrolling horizontally to continually provide news, information. The present research is based on an inventory of linguistic cliches extracted from crawlers, headlines, messages or written information displayed on the TV screen during news programs and political debates, taken especially from the niche channel news (Edirie speciala - Romania TV, Sinteza zilei - Antena 3, Jocuri de putere - Realitatea TV, Digi24, broadcast news). The focus of investigation is primarily on identifying the linguistic behaviour of cliches in the television discourse. From a methodological point of view, we use the theoretical tools provided by semantics, pragmastilistics, lexicology, but we also draw on those provided by media studies (agenda setting, constructivist perspective, etc.).

In Asia, however, the diagnosis, assessment and intervention of ASD is significantly lagging behind its western counterpart: there is no systematic prevalence study in China yet as to how many of its population has been affected by ASD. In this paper, we present our study, the first of its kind, to offer some preliminary, yet early valuable insights into the practices, knowledge and public awareness of ASD through lexical-affinity based emotion analysis on textual contents extracted from a notably well-known Chinese support site on ASD and one enormously popular social media site-Weibo. Mixed results were obtained. The 'sum' of our feeling is potentially positive and encouraging; yet the data obtained from Weibo are in line with previous works that public awareness of ASD is very low in China and the Asia Pacific region. Thanks to the increasing Chinese government supports and more research and development in this area, it is our 'collective' hope that more HCI community can engage in such efforts in China.

The introduction focuses on the phenomenon of "Slavic Vienna" of the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries. Both the living and political conditions of the Slays in the capital of the monarchy are closely related to the development of their cultural life. The following part briefly defines tamburitza music and the process of its dissemination as a result of Slavic students' migration. This is followed by the methodology, focusing on the possible criteria that can be used to approach the history of the Slavic tamburitza players in Vienna. The core of the study consists of the short profiles of Slavic tamburitza societies in Vienna. One of the conclusions is that Vienna was a sort of "transit hub" of tamburitza music on the way from the Balkans to the Czech lands. This fact should be highlighted: for example, the dictionary entry "tamburitza players" in Slovnik Ceske hudebni kultury (A Dictionary of Czech Musical Culture) only mentions one Czech-Viennese (tamburitza) composer. A truly "Czech branch" of the Viennese tamburitza scene was formed shortly before 1900 - in this study, it is represented by the profile of the Tovacovsky society and a list of societies. The short overview of the German tamburitza societies in Vienna has similar importance. The conclusion summarizes the role of migration for the dissemination of tamburitza music and its importance in the content of Slavic solidarity. The last sentences give the reasons for stagnation of tamburitza music in the inter-war period, both in Vienna and in Czechoslovakia, and describe the current situation in Vienna and in the Czech Republic.

Unfortunately, most of the languages in the world are 'minority languages', in the sense that they are spoken by a small population and with limited resource accumulation. Since the present speech technologies are mostly based on big data, partly due to the profound impact of deep learning, they are not directly applicable to minority languages. However, minority languages are so numerous and important that if we want to break the language barrier, they must be seriously taken into account. Recently, the Chinese government approved a fundamental research for minority languages in China: Multilingual Minorlingual Automatic Speech Recognition (M2ASR). Although the initial goal was speech recognition, the ambition of this project is more than that: it intends to publish all the achievements and make them free for the research community, including speech and text corpora, phone sets, lexicons, tools, recipes and prototype systems. In this paper, we will describe this project, report the first-year progress, and present the future plan.

Firstly, a series of text preprocessing is done by using the Chinese word segmentation tool combined with three kind of dictionary built by authors, i.e., the domain word dictionary, the domain synonym dictionary and the domain stopword dictionary. Then, according to the co-occurrence information of words in the government work reports, we attempt to conduct topic modeling on the corpus consisted of all the government work reports and single government work report respectively, Finally, we find 12 latent topics for the corpus, such as the "Economic reform", "Agriculture", "Government construction", "Defense military" and so on. Based on the 12 topics, we conduct the topic modeling on every single government work report, with which topic evolution analysis is carried out over the whole period of all government work reports.

The portrayal can influence the perception of Singapore among Malaysians. Singapore was part of Malaysia for about two years (1963-1965) and its brief union represents a crucial historical episode. The episode is analysed using Toulmin's argument structures. The analysis identifies the claims, grounds and warrants for the arguments, and it also examines the use of lexicogrammatical and intertextual features. Certain arguments articulate the benefits of the merger and it is endorsed by foreign and local leaders, and the general population. Subsequently, other arguments articulate the threats which Singapore posed and its separation is made to seem inevitable. The textbook portrays Singapore as an enthusiastic partner and later a distrusted partner of the Malaysian Federal Government. Its arguments validate the state-sanctioned version of history. The article also provides four proposals to improve history textbooks.

Model of the Dynamic Construction Process of Texts and Scaling Laws of Words Organization in Language Systems	PLOS ONE			English	Article							LONG-RANGE CORRELATIONS; POWER LAWS; DNA; ZIPFS	Scaling laws characterize diverse complex systems in a broad range of fields, including physics, biology, finance, and social science. The human language is another example of a complex system of words organization. Studies on written texts have shown that scaling laws characterize the occurrence frequency of words, words rank, and the growth of distinct words with increasing text length. However, these studies have mainly concentrated on the western linguistic systems, and the laws that govern the lexical organization, structure and dynamics of the Chinese language remain not well understood. Here we study a database of Chinese and English language books. We report that three distinct scaling laws characterize words organization in the Chinese language. We find that these scaling laws have different exponents and crossover behaviors compared to English texts, indicating different words organization and dynamics of words in the process of text growth. We propose a stochastic feedback model of words organization and text growth, which successfully accounts for the empirically observed scaling laws with their corresponding scaling exponents and characteristic crossover regimes. Further, by varying key model parameters, we reproduce differences in the organization and scaling laws of words between the Chinese and English language. We also identify functional relationships between model parameters and the empirically observed scaling exponents, thus providing new insights into the words organization and growth dynamics in the Chinese and English language.

These translations, made by the philosopher in the last years of his life, have also been considered to be a sort of 'continuation of Leviathan by others means'. Starting from here, the article, based on a comparative lexical analysis of the original Greek and English texts, aims to highlight three of these 'means' Hobbes uses to disseminate his political theory in a period during which he could not write freely because of censorship.

J	Jamison, K				Jamison, Kelda			Hefty Dictionaries in Incomprehensible Tongues: Commensurating Code and Language Community in Turkey	ANTHROPOLOGICAL QUARTERLY			English	Article						Commensuration; language community; textualization; Kurdish; Turkey	STANDARD LANGUAGE; REVITALIZATION; IDEOLOGY; TECHNOLOGIES; CIRCULATION; REGIMES	In this article, I consider one aspect of the larger linguistic-political project of rendering Kurdish an "equivalent" language in a world of standard languages: the material contours of text artifacts, and their commensurating capacities. In Turkey, where Turkish has long been the sole officially sanctioned code of public life, the project of asserting equivalence takes place in no small part as a function of an increasingly textualized and widely circulating Kurdish. Inserting Kurdish, both spoken and printed, into ever more arenas disrupting the expectations of which code goes with which context has become a central plank in a Kurdish political project. Yet relatively few people actually read the texts in question. The circulation of largely unread Kurdish texts allows us to investigate how material qualities of text objects-shape, sheen, heft, etc.-contribute to the assertion of particular forms of linguistic commensurability. I examine how textual forms anchor affiliations of loyalty and allegiance to language community, even without necessarily transforming speech practices and norms of pragmatic usage. In the Kurdish project of commensurating codes, the circulation of textual artifacts stacked newspapers, glossy street signs, hefty dictionaries, paperback novels works to signal the presence of the genres they are presumed to contain. At least three commensurating processes are at play here: between spoken Kurdish and its textual equivalent; between "Kurdish" and "Turkish" as the orienting codes of their respective language communities; and between "Kurds" and "Turks" as members of those communities, participants in a fiercely contested struggle over sovereignty and resources. At stake in these assertions of linguistic equivalence the normative purchase of a would-be newly commensurate Kurdish are politically and socially consequential mappings of groupness, polity, and political legitimacy.

J	Montiel, CJ; Umel, A; de Leon, M				Montiel, Cristina Jayme; Umel, Audris; de Leon, Marlene			Discursive Construction of Political Categories and Moral Fields: God Versus Rights and Access in a Reproductive Health Legislative Debate	POLITICAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						discourse analysis; rhetoric; political categories; moral field; storyline; reproductive health; religion; text mining	SOCIAL CATEGORIZATION; DISCOURSE ANALYSIS; PSYCHOLOGY; CONFLICT; MEDIA	Using a discursive lens, we argue that politicians rhetorically construct categories, storylines, and moral fields. We further claim that such discursive products are action-oriented toward gaining popular support in a public sphere that is politically fault lined along similar moral orders. As a case in point, we analyze speeches delivered during congressional voting on a Reproductive Health bill (RH bill). Employing a mixed methods strategy, we first implement a quantitative lexical analysis of frequently used words, followed by a qualitative detection of cohering storylines on both sides of the debate. Results show that oppositionists mark their speeches with a deployment of the word God, while bill supporters use the word access conspicuously. One storyline claims that The RH bill stands against God, while the other purports that The RH bill advocates rights and access. Although both storylines assert moral righteousness, they invoke two different moral orders backed by power blocs and the public at large. The God story appeals to a Catholic discourse and the moral order loudly supported by the politically powerful Catholic Bishops Conference of the Philippines. The rights/access narrative references a liberal morality frame maintained by social liberals and Philippine President Aquino. We end our paper by introducing the idea of an intrastate discursive lens to analyze moral fields constructed by politicians, oriented toward winning support from the public at large.

Methods: This is a qualitative, exploratory, descriptive cross-sectional study, carried out in the form of survey. A letter of invitation was sent to higher education institutions that had at least one class that graduated by the end of the first semester of 2010 and provided the Nutrition education discipline syllabus. The software Analyse Lexicale par Contexte d'un Ensemble de Segments de Texte (Image, Toulouse, Franca) version 4.7 was used in the textual data analysis of the syllabuses, and the social representation theory was adopted as the theoretical model. Results: Data were obtained from 46 participant higher education institutions (11.7%), of which 18 were public institutions. Lexical analysis revealed the formation of two independent axes, which were composed respectively of words from the reference list of relevant books and articles included in the discipline syllabus and words related to the discipline program, indicating a lack of association between "reference list" and "text". As for the syllabus content, it was observed that the educational process should be composed of analysis, planning, and implementation, but these three steps (defined by classes) do not seem to be related or connected to each other, demonstrating a nutrition (and food) education teaching gap. Conclusion: This analysis revealed the need to restructure the nutrition education syllabuses to promote greater integration between theory and practice. However, in order to ensure higher qualification and competence of future professionals, it is suggested deeper consideration including the political-pedagogical projects of nutrition undergraduate programs and the Diretrizes Curriculares Nacionais (National Curriculum Guidelines).

It involves building classifiers capable of detecting human emotions for a specific application, for example, analyzing reactions to product launches, monitoring emotions at sports events, or discerning opinions in political debates. Most successful approaches rely heavily on costly manual annotation. To alleviate this burden, we propose a distant supervision method-Dystemo-for automatically producing emotion classifiers from tweets labeled using existing or easy-to-produce emotion lexicons. The goal is to obtain emotion classifiers that work more accurately for specific applications than available emotion lexicons. The success of this method depends mainly on a novel classifier-Balanced Weighted Voting (BWV)-designed to overcome the imbalance in emotion distribution in the initial dataset, and on novel heuristics for detecting neutral tweets. We demonstrate how Dystemo works using Twitter data about sports events, a fine-grained 20-category emotion model, and three different initial emotion lexicons. Through a series of carefully designed experiments, we confirm that Dystemo is effective both in extending initial emotion lexicons of small coverage to find correctly more emotional tweets and in correcting emotion lexicons of low accuracy to perform more accurately.

Consequently, software requirements must conform to those privacy policies. To help stakeholders extract privacy goals from policies, we introduce a semiautomated framework that combines crowdworker annotations, natural language typed dependency parses, and a reusable lexicon to improve goal-extraction coverage, precision, and recall. The framework evaluation consists of a five-policy corpus governing web and mobile information systems, yielding an average precision of 0.73 and recall of 0.83. The results show that no single framework element alone is sufficient to extract goals; however, the overall framework compensates for elemental limitations. Human annotators are highly adaptive at discovering annotations in new texts, but those annotations can be inconsistent and incomplete; dependency parsers lack sophisticated, tacit knowledge, but they can perform exhaustive text search for prospective requirements indicators; and while the lexicon may never completely saturate, the lexicon terms can be reliably used to improve recall. Lexical reuse reduces false negatives by 41%, increasing the average recall to 0.85. Last, crowd workers were able to identify and remove false positives by around 80%, which improves average precision to 0.93.

VLAAMS DIERGENEESKUNDIG TIJDSCHRIFT			English	Article							VETERINARY STUDENTS FRANCE; LIBRARY	There was a time when science still had to 'hatch'. An era during which man often extrapolated existing knowledge to a level beyond reality. That period is not as far behind us as we would like to believe. Breeding of animals has always stimulated man's fantasy. Out of this, a very interesting myth - or is it a mystery? - was born: the existence of a hybrid between horse and cow, 'Le Jumart'. On top of the very well-known hybrids between horses and donkeys, the French 'capitaine des haras' Francois Alexandre de Garsault (1692-1778) describes the procedure of how to create a hybrid between a cow and a horse in his widespread and well known 'Nouveau Parfait Marechal', first published in 1741. In depth research showed that he was far from being the only one who believed in the existence of such a crossover species. Other well-respected contemporary scientists even dedicate chapters in their textbooks on this animal, such as the French naturalist and medical doctor Jean-Pierre Buchoz (1731-1807) in his 'Traite Economique et Physique de Gros Menu Betail' published in 1778. Even opinion leaders Charles Bonnet (1720-1793) and Lazzarro Spallanzani (1729-99) were convinced that these animals really roamed around in France during the 18th century. Finally, even the founder of the first 'Ecole Veterinaire' in the world, Claude Bourgelat (1712-1779) testified in a letter to Bonnet to have admired the product of a stallion and a cow with his own eyes. Fortunately, the debate could count on important disbelievers as well, with Albrecht von Haller taking the lead by publishing a paper in the 'Supplement a l'Encyclopedie ou Dictionnaire Raisonne des Sciences, des Arts et Metiers' (1777), in which he calls the existence of the Jumart a 'fable'. It would take another century for Andre Suchetet (1849-1910) to publish an 'Extrait des Memoires de la Societe Zoologique de France' with the title 'La Fable des Jumarts' (1889). Extremely interested in hybridization, this 19th century politician and member of several scientific societies, faces the challenge to finally steer the scientific community to a general conclusion on this enigma. This paper describes in a chronological order the rise and fall of one of the most intriguing 'fabula' in reproductive medicine and how it took emerging modern science about 200 years to decide on 'myth' or 'mystery'.

To do this, we analyze the role of these factors in the representation of actors, events, processes and circumstances selected in history textbooks to describe the government of Salvador Allende (1970-1973), the coup d'Etat (1973) and the military dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet (1973-1990). Our concern for textbooks lies in their importance as official instruments of memory, because the interest in these historical periods is related to their important role in the transmission of a traumatic past to new generations. The analysis reveals, first, the potential of the adverb, nominalization and sentence discursive order to produce discursive meanings and, secondly, the construction of historicizing patterns from these capabilities.

Previous research with very different repertoires have established that lexical heterogeneity is a common trend in the entire colonial written production. The objective of this research is to check whether a particular repertoire, such as relations of the Government of Yucatan (1579-1581) represents a homogeneous or heterogeneous body of indigenous loans incorporation. Quantitative and qualitative methodologies are used to analyse the potential lexical plurality of these texts which are associated with certain specific factors. The findings corroborate that lexical heterogeneity is present, despite being a uniform corpus, and show three different trends when including prehispanic concepts in Spanish documents.

J	Breed, A; Carstens, W; Olivier, J				Breed, Adri; Carstens, Wannie; Olivier, Jako			The DBAL: An unknown digital language museum	TYDSKRIF VIR GEESTESWETENSKAPPE			Afrikaans	Article						Digital Bibliography of Afrikaans Linguistics; linguistics database; Afrikaans linguistics sources; linguistic usage patterns; digitalisation of sources		The Digital Bibliography of Afrikaans Linguistics (DBAL) is a comprehensive database of Afrikaans linguistics and language-related sources. This. database includes more than 16 000 sources, of which 9 500 are available in full-text format. In addition, 1 500 links to external full text sources are also listed. This article reports on research on the usage patterns of the DBAL. In this regard, the assumption that the extensive archive provided by the DBAL is not used sufficiently by potential users is confirmed The DBAL was based on the Bibliografie Nederlandse Taal- en Letterkunde (BNTL) or Bibliography of Dutch Linguistics and Literature. In terms of the establishment of the DBAL, it was important that the database not only includes lists of sources but also provides an archive of digitalised sources. From the start of the development of the database in 1993 up to its official launch in 2010, the database now includes not only articles from academic journals, books, dissertations and theses, but also reviews, newspaper articles and online material. A process of digitalisation of out-of-print books on Afrikaans linguistics was also initiated. After acquiring the necessary rights from authors, publishers or families of deceased authors, a number of key historical works on Afrikaans linguistics and related fields were scanned and added to the database. The entries in the database cover 193 different categories. The majority of sources in the database are listed under "Diachronic linguistics and language history", followed by "Education and teaching", "Language practice and the study of language in use", "Language politics" and "Lexicography". Usage statistics indicate that from June 2010 up to December 2015 a total of 6 672 searches were conducted on the DBAL. This included searches from 1038 individual devices. Most of the visitors are from South Africa; however, a fair number of visitors from Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany were also noted. A survey was conducted among current and prospective users of the DBAL. Most of the respondents were university lecturers, researchers or students. However, a small number of language practitioners and journalists were also part of the research population. Most of the respondents indicated that they work in the fields of sociolinguistics, descriptive linguistics, language history or language practice. The majority of respondents are associated with universities in South Africa; however, a small number of international universities were also represented. The responses indicate the importance of word of mouth in terms of the marketing of the database. Most respondents who are already users of the database noted that they use the database at least once a month. From the survey it is clear that the DBAL is regarded as a useful research resource. It is also clear that more should be done towards marketing the database among potential users and especially linguistics students. Furthermore, greater co-operation from role-players such as Afrikaans linguists and linguistics lecturers is needed. A future expansion to the DBAL would be multilingual interfaces, as well as the inclusion of even more international materials. In addition, the DBAL can clearly act as a prototype for similar projects in related fields and for other South African languages. As a research resource the DBAL clearly has an important role to play. The DBAL has established itself as a digital monument of the Afrikaans language. The groundwork has been laid for the development of the DBAL from an archive of digitalised material to the basis of a dynamic open-source knowledge community of Afrikaans linguists.

Stochastic Model for Phonemes Uncovers an Author-Dependency of Their Usage	PLOS ONE			English	Article							LEXICAL ACCESS; CHINESE; REALITY; WORD	We study rank-frequency relations for phonemes, the minimal units that still relate to linguistic meaning. We show that these relations can be described by the Dirichlet distribution, a direct analogue of the ideal-gas model in statistical mechanics. This description allows us to demonstrate that the rank-frequency relations for phonemes of a text do depend on its author. The author-dependency effect is not caused by the author's vocabulary (common words used in different texts), and is confirmed by several alternative means. This suggests that it can be directly related to phonemes. These features contrast to rank-frequency relations for words, which are both author and text independent and are governed by the Zipf's law.

RITUAL DIVERSITY AND DIVERGENCE OF CLASSIC MAYA DYNASTIC TRADITIONS: A LEXICAL PERSPECTIVE ON WITHIN-GROUP CULTURAL VARIATION	LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY			English	Article							EVOLUTION; DEMOGRAPHY; GUATEMALA; ARCHAEOLOGY; COMPLEXITY; INFERENCES; EMERGENCE; POLITICS; DISTANCE; BEHAVIOR	To study the Classic Maya is to at once recognize the shared material representations and practices that give coherence to this cultural category as a unit of analysis, as well as to critically examine the diversity and idiosyncrasy of specific cultural traits within prehispanic Maya society. Maya hieroglyphic writing, in particular the tradition of inscribing texts and images on carved stone monuments, offers evidence for widespread and mutually intelligible cultural practices that were, at the same time, neither unchanging nor uniform in their semantic content. As conduits of linguistic and cultural information, Maya hieroglyphic monuments offer detailed records of Classic Maya dynastic history that include the names, dates, and specific rituals performed by elite individuals. In this article, we analyze the distribution and diversity of these inscriptions to examine ritual variation and the divergence of dynastic traditions in Classic Maya society. Diversity indices and methods adapted from population genetics and ecology are applied to quantify the degree of ritual differentiation and evaluate how these measures vary over time and are partitioned within and between elite populations. Results of this research refine our understanding about the variation of Classic Maya ritual traditions and make substantive contributions to examining the population structure of cultural diversity within past complex societies.

In such research, opinions about politicians are typically divided into positive, negative, or neutral. In our research, the goal is to mine political opinion from social media at a higher resolution by assessing statements of opinion related to the personality traits of politicians; this is an angle that has not yet been considered in social media research. A second goal is to contribute a novel retrieval-based approach for tracking public perception of personality using Gough and Heilbrun's Adjective Check List (ACL) of 110 terms describing key traits. This is in contrast to the typical lexical and machine-learning approaches used in sentiment analysis. High-precision search templates developed from the ACL were run on an 18-month span of Twitter posts mentioning Obama and Romney and these retrieved more than half a million tweets. For example, the results indicated that Romney was perceived as more of an achiever and Obama was perceived as somewhat more friendly. The traits were also aggregated into 14 broad personality dimensions. For example, Obama rated far higher than Romney on the Moderation dimension and lower on the Machiavellianism dimension. The temporal variability of such perceptions was explored.

With the vast use of social media and internet applications such as e-commerce, e-tourism and e-government, numerous comments and opinions are broadcasted per day, thus an automatic way of analyzing them is of great importance. The present paper focuses on sentiment analysis for Greek texts, obtained from Web 2.0 platforms. Greek is a language that lacks an in-depth availability of natural language processing tools in the sense that most of them are not publicly available. The novelty of the article is that instead of utilizing preprocessing tools such as Part-of-Speech taggers, text stemmers and polar-word lexica, it incorporates the translation of the Greek token as provided by the Google Translator (R) API. Since automatic translation of Greek sentences often results in poor translations where the meaning of the original sentence is severely deteriorated, the translation of each token individually is almost 100 % correct. However, taking the translation of every Greek token poses a significant issue to the outcome of the classification process for practically any classifier, therefore, we introduce the use of a powerful ensemble algorithm that is highly customizable to the particular needs of the application, such as being learned with respect to different loss functions and thus dealing with a large number of dimensions. This algorithm is called Gradient Boosting Machines and experimental results support our claim that it surpasses other, well-known machine learning techniques with a significant improvement for our task.

It is more than a simple website, but a popular tool of communication. Social networking users communicate between them exchanging a several kinds of content including a free text, image and video. Today, the social media users have a special way to express themselves. They create a new language known as "internet slang", which crosses the same meaning using different lexical units. This unstructured text has its own specific characteristics, such as, massive, noisy and dynamic, while it requires novel preprocessing methods adapted to those characteristics in order to ease and make the process of the classification algorithms effective. Most of previous works about social media text classification eliminate Stopwords and classify posts based on their topic (e.g. politics, sport, art, etc). In this paper, we propose to classify them in a lower level into diverse pre-chosen classes using three machine learning algorithms SVM, Naive Bayes and K-NN. To improve our classification, we propose a new preprocessing approach based on the Stopwords, Internet slang and other specific lexical units. Finally, we compared between all results for each classifier, then between classifiers results.

Capturing Digest Emotions by Means of Fuzzy Linguistic Aggregation	SENTIMENT ANALYSIS AND ONTOLOGY ENGINEERING: AN ENVIRONMENT OF COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE	Studies in Computational Intelligence		English	Article; Book Chapter						Fuzzy linguistic modeling; Ontology; Sentiment analysis; Sentic computing; Linguistic Ordered Weighted Averaging (LOWA); Computing with words; Fuzzy logic	IMPACT; MODEL	Distilling sentiments and moods hidden in the written (natural) language is a challenging issue which attracts research and commercial interests, aimed at studying the users behavior on the Web and evaluating the public attitudes towards brands, social events, political actions. The understanding of the written language is a very complicated task: sentiments and opinions are concealed in the sentences, typically associated to adjectives and verbs; then the intrinsic meaning of some textual expressions is not amenable to rigid linguistic patterns. This work presents a framework for detecting sentiment and emotion from text. It exploits an affective model known as Hourglass of Emotions, a variant of Plutchik's wheel of emotions. The model defines four affective dimensions, each one with some activation levels, called 'sentic levels' that represent an emotional state of mind and can be more or less intense, depending on where they are placed in the corresponding dimension. Our approach draws from the Computational Intelligence area to provide a conceptual setting to sentiment and emotion detection and processing. The novelty is the fuzzy linguistic modeling of the Hourglass of Emotions: dimensions are modeled as fuzzy linguistic variables, whose linguistic terms are the sentic levels (emotions). This linguistic modeling naturally enables the use of fuzzy linguistic aggregation operators (from Computing with Words paradigm), such as LOWA (Linguistic Ordered Weighted Averaging) that inherently accomplishes an aggregation of the emotions in order to get an emotional expression that synthesizes a set of emotions associated with different sentic levels and activation intensities. The whole process for the emotion detection and synthesis is described through its main tasks, from the text parsing up to emotions extraction, returning a predominant emotion, associated with each dimension of the Hourglass of Emotions. An ad-hoc ontology has been designed to integrate lexical information and relations, along with the Hourglass model.

J	Cerna, AM				Cerna, Alena M.			CHOCENSKY'S TREATISE ON BLOODLETTING AND ITS MEDICAL TERMINOLOGY	LISTY FILOLOGICKE			Czech	Article						Jan Berka of Chocen; Kristan of Prachatice; Old Czech language; bloodletting		The books on bloodletting attributed to John Berka of Chocen (Jan Chocensky, 1494-1545 or 1548) a doctor, Prague politician, the rector of the Prague University and printer belonged to the most known and widespread phlebotomic treatises printed in the 16th century. The article demonstrates that Chocensky's work was not original but based upon older treatises, especially those written by Kristan of Prachatice. Then, it compares the three editions of Chocensky's book (1532, 1538 and 1597) and shows that their language was deliberately adapted to the changes which Czech language underwent during that time. Later editions attest to the fact that publishers tried to make the text as comprehensible and exact as possible. The vocabulary of bloodletting was not very abundant and was rooted in the Medieval Czech: e.g. bloodletting through veins / cupping glasses pusteti ziloulbankami; strike / cut open a vein - zatiti/otevriti zilu; blood-letter (the person) - pustedlinik; blood - letter (the instrument) pustadlo; cupping glass - banka. The comparison with the 16th century dictionaries, published e.g. by Tomas Reselius and especially by Daniel Adam of Veleslavin, demonstrates that the vocabulary formed a stable part of the Czech Humanist language. At the same time, in comparison with the terminology of other branches, this vocabulary appears to have been limited in its development, not following the tendency to specification. This was the consequence of the fact that the method of bloodletting had been pushed off to the periphery of medical therapies and went to the hands of non-doctors barbers and tonsorial practicians.

The considered authors are: (a) Mihai Eminescu, Romania's national poet and a remarkable journalist of his time, and (b) Ion C. Bratianu, one of the most important Romanian politicians from the middle of the 18th century. Both orators have a common journalistic interest consisting in their desire to spread the word about political issues in Romania via the printing press, the most important public voice at that time. In addition, both authors exhibit writing style particularities, and our aim is to explore these differences through our ReaderBench framework that computes a wide range of lexical and semantic textual complexity indices for Romanian and other languages. The used corpus contains two collections of speeches for each orator that cover the period 1857-1880. The results of this study highlight the lexical and cohesive textual complexity indices that reflect very well the differences in writing style, measures relying on Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) semantic models.

It uses the lexica extracted from the manual annotation based on Appraisal Theory, of some 30 K word texts. The underlying hypothesis is that using this framework it is possible to precisely pinpoint ironic content through the deep semantic analysis of evaluative judgement and appreciation. The paper presents the manual annotation phase realized on 112 texts by two well-known Italian journalists. After a first experimentation phase based on the lexica extracted from the xml output files, we proceeded to retag lexical entries dividing them up into two subclasses: figurative and literal meaning. Finally more fine-grained Appraisal features have been derived and more experiments have been carried out and compared to results obtained by a lean sentiment analysis. The final output is produced from held out texts to verify the usefulness of the lexica and the Appraisal theory in detecting ironic content.

We present Empath, a tool that can generate and validate new lexical categories on demand from a small set of seed terms (like "bleed" and "punch" to generate the category violence). Empath draws connotations between words and phrases by deep learning a neural embedding across more than 1.8 billion words of modern fiction. Given a small set of seed words that characterize a category, Empath uses its neural embedding to discover new related terms, then validates the category with a crowd-powered filter. Empath also analyzes text across 200 built-in, pre-validated categories we have generated from common topics in our web dataset, like neglect, government, and social media. We show that Empath's data-driven, human validated categories are highly correlated (r=0.906) with similar categories in LIWC.

Social media has been used to rally public opinion, increase awareness, spread information/misinformation, and organize large events. Data analysis is necessary to drive decision making, advertisement, political campaigning, counterintelligence, etc. The sheer volume of data and number of users calls for automated methods for analysis and classification of Arabic text. In this paper, the problem of analysis and classification of Arabic news reports was studied. Innovative methods, based on lexical analysis and machine learning, were employed to tame the complexity of the Arabic language. Different classification algorithms were compared and the classification accuracy results are promising. This research presents seminal steps toward specialized analysis of Arabic crowd-sourced data and social media.

We present a large scale study of news articles from partisan sources in the US across a variety of different issues. We first highlight that differences between sides exist by predicting the political leaning of articles of unseen political bias. Framing can be driven by different types of morality that each group values. We emphasize differences in framing of different news building on the moral foundations theory quantified using hand crafted lexicons. Our results show that partisan sources frame political issues differently both in terms of words usage and through the moral foundations they relate to.

SA enables observation, experiment, and quantification of emotions of the public toward a particular issue. However, there is not much SA done with respect to the Malay Language, especially in the context of the Malay dialects used in social media. The research presented in this paper aims to perform SA on one of the derivatives of the Malay language, namely Sabah Language. The Sabah Language, unlike many other languages, does not have a fixed spelling and, when used in an unstructured form as in the case of social media, poses particular difficulties for SA. This paper takes a lexicon-based approach to SA of the Sabah Language as used on social media. For the investigation, the corpuses selected were Facebook posts and tweets written in the Sabah language, 443 posts and tweets in total. Each was manually annotated as positive, negative or neutral by three annotators. As Sabah Language is a derivative of Malay language, the words used in Sabah Language contains most of Malay words. That is why, in Sentiment-Lexicon (SL) construction process, opinion-bearing Malay SL is retrieved, modified and expanded to build Sabah SL. Three different methods of assigning scores to the words in SL (opinion-bearing words) were employed during SL construction: (i) Simple PSA, (ii) Simple PSA with Switch Negation (PSASN) and (iii) Strength-based PSA. In this paper, pre-processing phase that includes spellchecker and shortform corrector is also implemented to reduce distinct word to be analyzed for SA. In classification phase, two classification methods, simple and bias aware classifications, were used to classify the posts. Experiments are conducted to show the effect of SL modification and expansion, the effect of pre-processing as well as the effect of bias-aware classification to the SA performed. Results show the highest accuracy of 85.10% was achieved using bias-aware classification with the modified and expanded SL, scores are assigned using Simple PSA and the pre-processed text.

J	Krongauz, M				Krongauz, Maxim			The Law 'On the State Language of the Russian Federation': History of the Debates and Amendments	ZEITSCHRIFT FUR SLAVISCHE PHILOLOGIE			Italian	Article								The law "On the state language of the Russian Federation," adopted in 2005, became a reflection of debates about the Russian language at the beginning of the twenty-first century and caused frustration in both conservative and liberal segments of society. On multiple occasions, attempts were made to amend the law or enact additional laws aimed at "protecting the Russian language." Some attempts to toughen the legislation were successful (for example, the adoption of legislative bans on swearing), while others were not. All attempts, however, gave rise to new disputes. The study of the history of the discussions of the federal law, as well as the history of later legislative initiatives, helps reconstruct the lively and contentious debate about the Russian language that has taken place in Russia since the beginning of the twenty-first century. More specifically, a linguistic analysis of the text of the law allows us to clarify the original intention of its authors, as well as their concessions to opponents. In addition to these problems, more specific public and government initiatives, such as the 2009 order of the Ministry of Education "On the approval of the list of grammars, dictionaries and reference books containing the norms of the modern Russian literary language in its use as a state language of the Russian Federation", have also caused heated public debate. Most of the legislative initiatives are based on the new legal concept of "Russian as the state language," which is accepted as obvious, but in fact requires reflection and linguistic interpretation.										13	0	0	0	0	UNIVERSITATSVERLAG C WINTER HEIDELBERG GMBH	HEIDELBERG	POSTFACH 10 61 40, D-69051 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY	0044-3492			Z SLAV PHILOL	Z.

The paper proposes a new method based on Bilingual Semantic Cor-respondence Analysis (BiSCAN). In the new method, a bilingual document-pair are looked as two views for the same semantic content and a single topic space is created for each language by using partial least squares (PLS) method in order to capture statistical dependencies of bilingual semantic correspondence. The topic spaces are merged for document clustering task. Experimental results on Chinese-English stories collected from the Hong Kong government news website show that performance of the presented method is over or near to mono-lingual clustering in the original feature spaces and significantly better than CL-LSI.

So it is necessary to analyze these data. While it is difficult to dig out sufficient information from these data because of their shortness and sparsity. In this paper, we propose a sentiment orientation analysis method based on background and domain sentiment lexicon expansion, which reflects user's sentiment orientation of evaluation objects more comprehensively. Then we can obtain a more informative and significant sentiment orientation of short text. In the experiment, Chinese Weibo data sets of French security and Turkish Airlines are used to show that our sentiment orientation analysis method has better performance than the domain sentiment lexicon based method.

However, no considerable research work is carried out at building applications to consume this data for good governance. Topic models are successfully used for various text analysis tasks and are employed here. In order to improve accuracy of the model as government policies is a specialized domain, the model is extended with expert guidance by following a semi-supervised approach. POS tagging is used to identify user opinions which is evaluated through WordNet dictionary. In order to perform real-time analysis, the model is tuned to streaming tweets data which is analyzed to produce real-time analysis about the top government policies.

C	Mierla, A		Taranu, A		Mierla, A.			On Anglicisation and Anglicisms: Fancy English Loanwords in Romanian	GOVERNING FOR THE FUTURE: INTERDISCIPLINARY PERSPECTIVES FOR A SUSTAINABLE WORLD			English	Proceedings Paper	International Political Science Conference on Governing for the Future - Interdisciplinary Perspectives for a Sustainable World	JUN 09-12, 2016	Bucharest, ROMANIA			anglicism; anglicisation; loanword; calque		With the advent of globalization and the ever-growing need of global communication, English has earned the undisputed status of lingua franca, regardless of the wide range of positions taken by the various categories of opinion-makers - journalists, linguists, politicians. The concerns about the evolution of languages and the tremendous influence of English on communication have resulted in an impressive number of studies dedicated to this issue. Consequently, English has acquired various labels indicating its prevalence in many fields (science, politics, international relations, research, education): it is now considered a global language and even called "the Latin of globalization" [1], Euro-speak or Bruxellish and even Globish [2], which is described as "decaffeinated English", leading some linguists to mention the "hegemony" [3] and the "tyranny" of English. Section 1 of the paper examines the gradual spread of English in Romanian and the stages it underwent before reaching its current status. The first English-origin borrowings date back in the second half of the 19th century and it was French through which they were adopted in Romanian, but it is only at the beginning of the 20th century that we can speak of an English influence on Romanian. The second stage of English influence upon Romanian is considered to be in the '70s-`80s when English-origin borrowings could only be encountered in certain types of texts in newspapers and scientific or literary works. With the fall of communism, a new age of anglicisation starts - it is now that the overwhelming "inflation" of anglicisms sets in many fields of activity and specialized lexicons. Section 2 of the paper concerns the fields most responsive to English-origin loanwords: mass-media, advertising, economics and finance, information technology, tourism, art and entertainment, with an emphasis on journalese. Probably the most important factor that has contributed to the impact of English on Romanian is mass-media, followed by information technology and economics and finance. In mass-media, words and phrases such as advertising, brand, briefing, show, target (and even its adapted Romanian related form a targeta) are almost always used as such and rarely replaced with their corresponding (although also new and perfectly adapted) forms: publicitate, marca nregistrata) comerciala, informare, spectacol,.inta. In Section 3 we discuss the concept of anglicism, the main criteria of classification and the resulting categories. According to their function (Section 3.1), a distinction is made between necessary anglicisims and fancy anglicisms. The degree of integration and assimilation in Romanian separates anglicisms that are " totally unadapted" from " fully integrated" anglicisms (Section 3.2). As a means of enriching the vocabulary, anglicisms have been adopted in Romanian by means of borrowing, translation and calques (Section 3.3). Borrowings (or loanwords, also called neologisms) and calques (which involve a (quasi-) identity between the original word or phrase and its corresponding "copy" in the target language) are particularly frequent in Romanian and subject to semantic interferences (the so-called " false friends"), semantic changes and linguistic " innovations" often triggered by snobbery and consequently a source of mistakes, flagged up as inappropriate and inadequate and therefore disavowed by linguists.

The aim of this paper is to assess the use of a controlled vocabulary in the categorisation of legal texts. Controlled vocabularies such as the Medical Subject Headings, Compendex and AGROVOC have been proved to be very useful in the fields of biomedical research, engineering and agriculture, respectively. In this work, a number of lexicons are created for some pre-defined areas of law through an automated approach. The lexicons are then used to categorise cases from the Supreme Court into eight distinct areas of law. We then compared the performance of these lexicons with each other. We found that lexicons which have a mixture of single words and short phrases performs slightly better than those consisting simply of single words. Weights were also assigned to the terms and this had a significant positive impact on the classification accuracy. The number of words in each thesaurus was kept constant. A hierarchical classification was also attempted whereby cases were first classified into either a civil case or a criminal case. Civil cases were then further classified into company, labour, contract and land cases while criminal cases were classified into drugs, homicide, road traffic offences and other criminal offences. Our best model achieves a global accuracy of 78.9 %. Thus, we have demonstrated that it is possible to get good classification accuracies with legal cases through the use of automatically generated thesauri. This outcome of this research can become an integral part of the eJudiciary project that has already been initiated by the government. In line with the vision of the Judiciary, we are hereby in the process of creating an intelligent legal information system which will benefit all legal actors and will have a definite positive impact on the legal landscape of the Republic of Mauritius. Lawyers, attorneys and their assistants would spend less time on legal research and hence they would have more time to prepare their arguments for their case.

One of the main tasks of Opinion Mining is to determine whether an opinion is positive or negative. Therefore, the role of the feelings expressed on the web has become crucial, mainly due to the concern of businesses and government to automatically identify the semantic orientation of the views of customers or citizens. This is also a concern, in the area of health to identify psychological disorders. This research focuses on the development of a web application called SWePT (Web Service for Polarity detection in Spanish Texts), which implements the Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO) algorithm, extracting its features from an affective lexicon in Mexican Spanish. For this purpose, a corpus and an affective lexicon in Mexican Spanish were created. The experiments using three (positive, neutral, negative) and five categories (very positive, positive, neutral, negative, and very negative) allow us to demonstrate the effectiveness of the presented method. SWePT has also been implemented in the Emotion-bracelet interface, which shows the opinion of a user graphically.

Previously, single polarimetric imagery were employed in supervised and unsupervised classification schemes for sea ice investigation, which was preceded by image processing techniques such as segmentation and textural features. Recently, through the advent of polarimetric SAR sensors, investigation of polarimetric features in sea ice has attracted increased attention. While dual-polarimetric data has already been investigated in a number of works, full-polarimetric data has so far not been a major scientific focus. To explore the possibilities of full-polarimetric data and compare the differences in C- and X-bands, we endeavor to analyze in detail an array of datasets, simultaneously acquired, in C-band (RADARSAT-2) and X-band (TerraSAR-X) over ice infested areas. First, we propose an array of polarimetric features (Pauli and lexicographic based). Ancillary data from national ice services, SMOS data and expert judgement were utilized to identify the governing ice regimes. Based on these observations, we then extracted mentioned features. The subsequent supervised classification approach was based on an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). To gain quantitative insight into the quality of the features themselves (and reduce a possible impact of the Hughes phenomenon), we employed mutual information to unearth the relevance and redundancy of features. The results of this information theoretic analysis guided a pruning process regarding the optimal subset of features. In the last step we compared the classified results of all sensors and images, stated respective accuracies and discussed output discrepancies in the cases of simultaneous acquisitions.

Informative Document on queen Elizabeth is been writing by foreign language English which makes its difficult for a Marathi reader to understand and seek History of England, on Similar lines Literature Work on Shivaji is mostly documented in Marathi which makes foreign Historians difficult to gain know, in both case user is at times unknown of facts due to language and may lose interest on information. Vital information on current happing on village and taluka level are been published in newspaper with local language which setback information spread among other Masses. Many Time government documents and forms are been presented in English Language where a lay man from Marathi language background finds difficulty to understand information and even avoid such procedures therefore it highly urges for need of automated Software based Translation system which would assist in cross Domain information Retrieval. Machine Translation assist to translate Information presented in one language to other language. Information can be present in form of text, speech and image translating this information helps for sharing of information and ultimately information gain. A lot of work has been done on Translation of English to Hindi, Tamil Bangla and other foreign languages also. Machine Translation is challenging Research Area with numerous issues due to language ambiguity like grammar, Structure and even fluency of use. Numerous Methodologies have been proposed and developed which have uplifts and downfalls also, Although statistical and rule based at core with each having limitations. rule based produce accurate mapped translation and are trainable system but costly, whereas statistical produce fluent translation but lack accuracy and sense. Hybrid is combine approach which integrated approach and helps to optimize translation output. The research manuscript we present hybrid machine Translator for English to Marathi language which translated Web pages, text Documents on Agriculture (crops fruits for farmer), Medical reports in Marathi and tourism related information. Proposed System consists of Parallel Multi-Engines which process statistical and rule based Translation for same input document and produce a optimized result by performing statistical over rule based which give fluent language sense outputs. Mapper algorithm is been used in rule based Translation, with Agriculture corpus, medical and tourism corpus for statistical evaluation. Marathi wordnet has been implemented to enhance dictionary and incorporate better translation result Currently System has been proposed for text Document which can be extended to speech and voice. Comparative analysis for point view in one dimension of only limited set of Queries is done with Google Translator. Holding hybrid approach as better methodology. A Systematic survey of only 10 key articles used in research has been done. This research article is extension of our previous research surveys and partial implementations. And innovative Smeasure has been new parameter proposed and evaluated by our research team.

Previously, natural text processing and event generation required a lot of human efforts. Today we have high computing infrastructure with advance NLP metadata to leverage those tiresome efforts. TABARI an open source non distributed event-coding software was an early effort to generate events from a large corpus. It uses a shallow parser to identify the political actors, but ignores semantics and relation among the sentences. PETRARCH, the successor of TABARI, encodes event data into "who-did-what-to-whom" format. It uses Stanford CoreNLP to parse sentences and a static CAMEO dictionary to encode the data. To build dynamic dictionaries, we need to analyze more metadata such as the token, Named Entity Recognition (NER), co-reference, and many more from parsed sentences. Although these tools can code modest amounts of source corpora into event data they are too slow and suffer scalability issues when we try to extract metadata from a single document. The situation gets worse for other languages like Spanish or Arabic. In this paper, we develop a novel distributed framework using Apache Spark, MongoDB, Stanford CoreNLP, and PETRARCH. It shows a distributed workflow by using Stanford CoreNLP to extract all the metadata (parse tree, tokens, lemma, etc.) from the news corpora of the Gigaword dataset and storing it to MongoDB. Then it uses PETRARCH to encode events from the metadata. The framework integrates both tools using distributed commodity hardware and reduces text processing time substantially with respect to a non-distributed architecture. We have chosen Spark over traditional distributed frameworks like MapReduce, Storm, Mahout. Spark has in memory computation and lower processing time in both batch and stream processing compared to other options.

J	Nou, J				Nou, Jennifer			REGULATORY TEXTUALISM	DUKE LAW JOURNAL			English	Article							STATUTORY INTERPRETATION; AGENCY INTERPRETATIONS; LEGISLATIVE HISTORY; ADMINISTRATIVE REGULATIONS; JUDICIAL INTERPRETATION; DEFERENCE; LAW; RULES; INFORMATION; DELEGATION	This Article proposes a textualist approach to regulatory interpretation. Regulatory textualism, however, should be distinct from statutory textualism. Judges should interpret regulations armed not with dictionaries or other general linguistic aids, but rather with a hierarchy of sources that sheds light on the text's public meaning. Methodologically, this approach tailors positive political theory insights to the rulemaking process. That process features a number of pivotal actors, or veto-gates, who must sign off on a regulation before it can proceed. The court's interpretive task is to privilege those statements that are more likely to be credible sincere, not strategic reflections of the text's public meaning. Specifically, the judge should first consider the preamble's provision-by-provision explanations, which frequently respond to public comments raising potential ambiguities. If ambiguity persists, the judge should then consult the regulatory analyses, which predict the rule's consequences under specific factual scenarios. Both congressional and presidential veto-gates, as well as the public more generally, rely on these analyses when engaging with the regulatory process. Finally, if these materials conflict, the court should then defer to the agency's interpretation provided that the agency provides a reasoned explanation. In this manner, regulatory textualism asks how the reasonable reader of a rule would have understood its meaning as negotiated by the President, Congress, and other politically legitimate actors.

J	Schreven, S				Schreven, Stephanie			On the case of the missing detail and the twisted truth about hard work	ORGANIZATION			English	Article						Work; consumption; branding; copyright; fans; detail; text; equality; working consumer; prosumer; control		This text, its politics, and erotics originate in the case of the missing detail': the alliance between Warner Brothers Entertainment Inc. and the author J.K. Rowling during a trial over copyright infringement and fair use concerning a lexicon, which, I argue, puts at stake, as an opportunity, ownership in the properties of the story and world of Harry Potter. During the trial, the author alone takes center stage. In investigating the alliance and making a case for its shared interests, this text brings together work and consumption. I look at the role work and specifically hard work' by the author plays in criminalizing and containing consumption that is disorderly, disrespectful, and excessive: consumption by fans. Fans who write fan fiction are not content to merely read and consume; they disrespect the symbolic authority of the author to write their own and different stories and create symbolic value in excess of and for the original story. However, in the end, and in this case, at stake in criminalizing and containing consumption by fans are interests that have nothing to do with hard work, but with collecting rent instead, on the license to use the Harry Potter trademark for branding. Consumption that is disorderly, disrespectful, and excessive undermines the symbolic value of the brand, embodied in a distinctive identity, and hence its attractiveness to be licensed, by diluting it. The law functions to regulate consumption as proper to secure brand value, which legally renders the story of Harry Potter undead to the imagination.

J	Reyes, A				Reyes, Antonio			Building intimacy through linguistic choices, text structure and voices in political discourse	LANGUAGE & COMMUNICATION			English	Article						Political discourse; Contextuality; Informality; Linguistic choices; Voices; Narratives of belonging	SPEAKERS; LANGUAGE; SELF	This paper analyzes linguistic variables employed strategically in various instances of political communication to present different levels of intimacy in relation to a continuum between contextuality and formality (Heylighen and Dewaele, 2002) in political talk. Within a given situation, political actors express these-choices also in relation to a broader context around their personas: the Message (Lempert and Silverstein, 2012, 2003). The linguistic variables under consideration range from concrete units such as lexical choices (i.e., "marked register usages" [Moven, 2007; Myers-Scotton, 2001], to narratives of belonging (Duranti, 2006), to textual organization and instances of intertextuality (Blackledge, 2005; Fairclough, 1992, 2003; Wodak, 2008), in particular, by means of different voices (Balchtin, 1981) politicians bring into the here-and-now moment of discourse. The data for the analysis is obtained from different instances of political talk (speeches and debates) and different politicians (Palin, Biden, George W. Bush and Obama). The linguistic variables display different levels of formality indexing two Aristotelian modes of persuasion: Pathos and Ethos. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

While previous studies have mostly explored the discourse of nuclear proliferation through the analysis of newspaper texts, few have considered corpora from different sites or considered the changes, transformations and contradictions that take place when meanings are delocated from one site and relocated in another. Elements of poststructuralist discourse theory, critical linguistics and corpus linguistics are brought together to consider how events were constructed within two corpora: UN Security Council (UNSC) resolutions and newspaper articles published in prominent UK and US broadsheets. WordSmith Tools (Version 5) was used to analyse word frequencies, statistical patterns of keywords, word collocation profiles and concordance patterns. Results indicate that the most salient lexical items refer to actors, strategic actions and technologies.

J	Novikov, VL				Novikov, V. L.			PERSONALITY AND DEVICE: OKUDZHAVA, VYSOTSKII, GALICH	RUSSIAN LITERATURE			Russian	Article						Bard Song; Bulat Okudzhava; Vladimir Vysotskii; Aleksandr Galich		The article is based on the hypothesis that in a poet's artistic system there is a dominant device that can be found on all levels of the text. This device is closely related to the poet's psychology and biography. Surveying the work of the three main representatives of the bard song ("author song"), the author holds that Okudzhava's poetics is determined by the "harmonized shift" ("garmonizirovannyj sdvig"), which corresponds with his emotional, hedonistic view of life. Vysotskii's poetics is characterized by semantic ambiguity, conflicting meanings, in accordance with his "dramatic" behaviour. Galich's poetics is that of choice, antithetical characters, a particular selection of lexical elements. His political choice, decisive for his fate, is the ontological equivalent of his work.										0	1	1	0	2	ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV	AMSTERDAM	PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS	0304-3479	1878-3678		RUSS LITERATURE	Russ.

J	Agnew, J				Agnew, Junko			The Politics of Language in Manchukuo: Hinata Nobuo and Gu Ding	MODERN ASIAN STUDIES			English	Article								This article explores the language politics of Manchukuo and the implications reflected in the literary texts of the Japanese writer Hinata Nobuo and the Chinese writer Gu Ding. Through the close examination of communicative failures, such as lexical misunderstandings, linguistic barriers, lies, and rumours in Hinata Nobuo's 'The Eighth Switching Point' and Gu Ding's 'The Wilds', this article illustrates the authors' different responses to the impact of this language politics. While both authors were aware of the mutable nature of language, Hinata perceived the Japanese language as a symbol of colonial power and thus the miscommunications between Japanese and Chinese in his story address the ethnic hierarchy embedded in language in the specific context of Manchukuo. Gu Ding, on the other hand, did not see language as a defining element of the culture of a nation, and therefore tried to construct a new type of language and community that were not restricted by the discursive notions of the Chinese and Japanese nations. Gu Ding's primary concern was the modernization of his native place and, to him, adherence to traditional language forms was insignificant and deleterious.

In the last decade, humans have come to share their opinions in social media on the Web (e.g., forum discussions and posts in social network sites). Opinions are important because whenever we need to take a decision, we want to know others' points of view. The interest of industry and academia in this field of study is partly due to its potential applications, such as: marketing, public relations and political campaign. Research in this field often considers English data, while data from other languages are less explored. In this work we evaluate the available resources to assist Portuguese language sentiment analysis. For doing this, we perform sentiment analysis in a data set of the accommodation sector. We compare different pos-taggers and sentiment lexicons. We also evaluate the impact of some linguistic rules regarding negation and the position of adjectives.

Many constructions formed in accordance with the rules governing the co-occurrence of their elements can nevertheless be retained in memory as separate units. Using large text corpora for the empirical data we are going to analyze the type of construction rho mam-mo u sigma ecb N (that's /just the whole N) which is realized in a wide variety of tokens and demonstrate that some tokens of the construction can be so frequent that they can be considered to be cognitively entrenched units and are preserved in memory as separate units of the language. Such units should be described as separate items of the lexicon. The practical task of the investigation is to refine our notions about the structural peculiarities of sigma mam-mo u rho ecb N (that's /just/ the whole N) and its variant rho mom-mo rho ecb u N (that's /just/ the whole N).(a). We are also going to identify some regularities of distribution of fillers of the slot N in both variants of the construction and formulate corresponding rules for such distribution.

Previous psychological researches have proven that emotion is of importance in individual risk perception. Could the effect apply to large societies? The five social mood time series including happiness, disgust, fear, anger and sadness were obtained by analyzing the text content of daily Sina Weibo using the five basic mood lexicon and term-based matching technique. Then the seven societal risk perceptions including social stability risk, daily life risk, resource & environment risk, public morals risk, government management risk, national security risk and economic & finance risk were gotten by corresponding the public searching behavior on Baidu search engine to the societal risk perception psychologically. Then the correlation between the social moods and societal risk perceptions was investigated by Granger causality analysis and liner regression model. The result found that social moods are predictive of societal risk perceptions but the effect of different kinds of social mood is distinguishing. The four negative moods predict societal risk perceptions positively which means negative social moods increase the public risk perception to societal risk factors. The research manifested that capturing public psychological characteristics on social media was feasible.

Sentiment Analysis, Opinion Mining and Emotion Analysis denote the area of research in Computer Science aimed at studying, analyzing and classifying text documents based on the underlying opinions expressed by their authors on various topics. While this is a tough task, because it is related to psychological aspects that are not always immediately evident in the lexical and syntactical aspects of the sentences, its importance may be paramount for several applications such as market analysis, political polls, etc. Fundamental pre-processing techniques for this task come from the area of Natural Language Processing, which may pose additional problems when the language of interest is different than English, and thus less (or less reliable) resources are available to extract the needed data from the text. This paper studies the performance of Sentiment Analysis, seen as a Text Categorization task, depending on the use of different classifiers and different features. While the approach is general, we focus on texts in Italian. The outcomes suggest which experimental settings can be most profitably used in this landscape, and show that significantly good results can be obtained.

F. Lyotard. Jean-Francois Lyotard remains best known for his 1979 study La Condition postmoderne. Lyotard's central concern in the text, the crisis of legitimation, comes to define the postmodern condition. His declared war on "grand narratives" initiates a critical reappraisal of knowledge, aesthetics, and politics in a post Enlightenment era. Postmodernism, as described by Lyotard, involves a challenge to universality and a rejection of exclusive claims to univocal authority. The "postmodern," as Lyotard contends, encompasses more than an historical period or a style; it refers to a philosophy that recognizes that narrative function is losing its functors, its great hero, its great dangers, its great voyages, its great goal. Dissensus, rather than consensus, is configured as the condition for new possibilities for thinking and living, free from the limits of operational criteria that place thinking and living under an obligation to the status quo. Postmodern knowledge is not simply a tool of the authorities, it refines our sensitivity to differences and reinforces our ability to tolerate the incommensurable. It is in Le Differend where Lyotard more fully articulates this philosophical notion of judgment as phrases in dispute. The concept of the differend allows Lyotard to join two concerns, art and politics. Lyotard's contributions to contemporary continental philosophy are many, with the concept of the differend, meta narratives, little-narratives, pagan aesthetics, and paralogy becoming permanent entries in the postmodern lexicon. Absence of pre-established rules, in aesthetics, politics, and ethics, and the obligation to honour the differend are Lyotard's most profound contributions to the field of thinking.

With the growing popularity of social media and user-generated content, efficient and effective sentiment analysis is critical to businesses and governments. Lexicon-based methods provide efficiency through their manually developed affective word lists and valence values. However, the predictions of such methods can be biased towards positive or negative polarity thus distorting the analysis. In this paper, we propose Bias-Aware Thresholding (BAT), an approach that can be combined with any lexicon-based method to make it bias-aware. BAT is motivated from cost-sensitive learning where the prediction threshold is changed to reduce prediction error bias. We formally define bias in polarity predictions and present a measure for quantifying it. We evaluate BAT in combination with AFINN and SentiStrength two popular lexicon-based methods on seven real-world datasets. The results show that bias reduces smoothly with an increase in the absolute value of the threshold, and accuracy increases as well in most cases. We demonstrate that the threshold can be learned reliably from a very small number of labeled examples, and supervised classifiers learned on such small datasets produce poorer bias and accuracy performances.

HSAS: Hindi Subjectivity Analysis System	2015 ANNUAL IEEE INDIA CONFERENCE (INDICON)	Annual IEEE India Conference		English	Proceedings Paper	12 IEEE Int C Elect Energy Env Communications Computer Control	DEC 17-20, 2015	New Delhi, INDIA			Data Mining; Text Mining; Subjectivity Analysis; Hindi Language; Natural Language Processing		With the development of Web 2.0, we are abundant with the documents expressing user's opinions, attitudes and sentiments in the textual form. This user generated textual content is an important source of information to make sound decisions by the organizations and the government. The textual information can be categorized into two types: facts and opinions. Subjectivity analysis is the automatic extraction of subjective information from the opinions posted by users and divides the content into subjective and objective sentences. Most of the works in subjectivity analysis exists for English language data but with the introduction of unicode standards UTF-8, Hindi language content on the web is growing very rapidly. In this paper, Hindi Subjectivity Analysis System (HSAS) is proposed. It explores two different methods of generating subjectivity lexicon using the available resources in English language and their comparative evaluation in performing the task of subjectivity analysis at the sentence level. The first method uses English language OpinionFinder subjectivity lexicon. The second method uses a small seed word list of Hindi language and expands it to generate subjectivity lexicon. Different evaluation strategies are used to validate the lexicon. We achieved 71.4% agreement with human annotators and similar to 80% accuracy in classification on a parallel data set in English and Hindi. Extensive simulations conducted on the test dataset confirm the validity of the suggested method.	[Jha, Vandana; Manjunath, N.; Shenoy, P. Deepa; Venugopal, K.

We develop a new software that provides an instant translation of a written text into signagrams to allow access to information on some topic among national and international users. The signagram is the unit for signage. As an example, we adapt the software to the situation of emergency, where government units have to respond and give instructions to the population. We construct a first ontology for the situation of emergency that we link to the dictionary for signagrams. The translation software is developed in Java. We then test technically the translation method.

Design of the speech corpus plays a very important role in overall quality of the text-to-speech system. A huge text corpus of one million words was created for existing text-to-speech system. We have crawled text from many domains like financial, government, current news etc. along with pre-built dictionaries. For the very first time, we have also generated and incorporated text from Hindi Short-Messaging-Service (SMS). The efforts were made to make the generic speech corpus for Hindi. The crawled text was first filtered for correctness e.g. spelling mistakes, validity to Hindi, word lengths etc. The filtered words were then carefully analyzed and ensured that phonetically balanced text is prepared. This cured text is then recorded by professional recordist in a studio environment. The recorded speech data is then processed and annotated to generate the final speech corpus. The paper explains the speech corpus creation process, beginning with text data crawling, filtering, recording and annotation phases. The final speech corpus thus generated is used in the Hindi Text-to-Speech system with the MOS of 2.8.

However a deeper analysis, combining a classification of vocabulary and an interpretive comparison of lexical structures, reveals a different focusing: while the AFP makes a distinction between the economic aspects (global context) and political ones (national context), the EFE takes it up more strenuously as a political issue directly related to the national economy and Europe.

The components fundamental in the structure of the epitaph are studied: their differences, determined by confessional belonging of the buried, as well as motive space of the 'plot' part of the gravestone inscriptions. The paper considers orthographical, lexical and other peculiarities of the epitaphs. Continuously changing political situation of Belarus has formed its cultural space and linguistic image. In west Belarus, two types of culture have crossed Roman-Catholic and Byzantine-Orthodox that carried confessional character and which can conventionally be called 'religious'. Church-Slavonic and Latin functioned on this land as sacral languages. Specifics of the language situation are clearly seen in the gravestone inscriptions of the Orthodox and Catholic necropolises. Epigraphic texts at a Catholic and Orthodox necropolis, following and preserving the Byzantine canon, have, nevertheless, distinctions. In the Orthodox tradition, a part of gravestone inscriptions has social character. The main distinction lies in the attitude to church faith. The epitaphs of these cemeteries are not distinguished by special originality as they represent a rather conservative genre and are biased towards traditional cliche and poetic formulas.										8	0	0	0	0	ACAD PRESS SAULE	DAUGAVPILS	1-3 SAULES ST, DAUGAVPILS, LV-5401, LATVIA	1691-5038		978-9984-14-710-9	COMP STUD			2015	6		2				101	111					11	Area Studies; Cultural Studies	Book Citation Index – Social Sciences & Humanities (BKCI-SSH)	Area Studies; Cultural Studies	BE6IP	WOS:000374195000008					2022-03-30	
J	Sato, M				Sato, Megumi			"Because of Clavier". The Beethovens and the Regime Change of Prepositions wegen, statt and waehrend in the Era 1520-1870	MUTTERSPRACHE			German	Article								This paper discusses the variation of the case government of some German prepositions, in particular wegen. In terms of a sociopragmatic approach, the historic language awareness is placed at the center of the discussion. In Chapter 2, we investigate first the language usage of Ludwig van Beethoven and his environment; the source is the quasi-spoken conversation books (1818-1827) with which Beethoven suffering increasing hearing loss was able to communicate with family, friends and acquaintances. The results of this case study suggest that the use of the dative case was assigned in the early 19th century to the informal language of immediacy and the use of the genitive to the formal language of distance. In Chapter 3, we describe the history of the language system and language usage statistically through the analysis of the prose text corpus (140 printed texts) from the period 1520 to 1870. Finally, in Chapter 4, the results of Chapters 2 and 3 are compared with meta-linguistic valuations in historical grammars and dictionaries. The sudden decrease of the dative in favor of the genitive after 1800 is then probably due in particular to the normative influence of the grammarian Adelung. Following Labov (1994), this case can be referred to as change from above. The increase in the dative case in the course of the 18th century (before the appearance of the grammar of Adelung) seems in contrast to reflect change from below. The use of the dative had first appeared in the spoken language and finally entered in the 18th century the prose texts of representative authors.

Live subtitling is needed especially for live events and is not restricted to television, but can also be provided to persons on site, e.g. to a deaf politician during a parliamentary debate. Live subtitling is demanding since the audio information has to be transformed into text within a few seconds. In this demonstration we present the Fraunhofer IAIS audio and video live subtitling system for standard German and Bavarian. The system was developed in the "Live Caption" project and consists of an online speech recognition and Speaker diarisation system. We employ our entire large annotated standard German broadcast corpus for training. In addition, we apply the system to Bavarian dialect by adapting the acoustic models and the pronunciation lexicon, exploiting a Bavarian media corpus. Due to the real-time restrictions and the spontaneous character of dialectal speech, the system performance is far from perfect, but encouraging.

The research is based on 453 social and political texts, editorials and feature articles in the English and Russian languages taken from famous media sources. In the course of the research, pragmalinguistic features of social and political texts were analysed on the basis of paradigmatic and syntagmatic relations, extralinguistic and intralinguistic features of the English and Russian languages. Summarizing the results of the research, the author elaborates an operating translation model taking into account specific features of social and political texts. This model reflects the main trends of translation process and the researcher describes the role of a translator taking into account lexical, semantic, syntactic, stylistic and pragmatic aspects of this type of texts.

Advances in Information and Communications Technologies have supported innovations in Knowledge Management (KM). Since the KM has been recognized as one of the critical factors for obtaining organizational competitiveness. KM is among the promising areas for the application of Semantic Web. In this paper we propose an approach to the development of a technological platform for KM that integrates semantic Web technologies. This platform supports all processes required in knowledge management. Therefore, the platform enables the automatic identification of patterns and generation of the taxonomies from unstructured texts (documents). The platform consists of tools that allow storing documents (from a knowledge contributor interface), processing of source documents, i.e. identifying sentences, stop-words, identifying n-grams, and generating bags of words; denoting lexical patterns, taxonomic-relation extraction, and inference algorithms to retrieve knowledge from a set of repositories. These algorithms use the previous phases to retrieve knowledge more accurately derived from the semi-structured or structured information previously generated.

The abandonment of public discourses bred by totalitarianism, which abounded in stereotypical, meaningless formulae, specific to the 'wooden language', engendered a lexical and semantic reinvigoration of language, meant to give new impetus to all forms of communication. During the last few years, channels of online informal communication have developed by means of chat programs, such as Messenger, Skype, Facebook or various forums. In full swing today, the language as used on the Internet offers a model, but also an anti-model of linguistic interaction, observable both in terms of the situations of communication and social relations. Our paper aims to establish the positive patterns of Internet language, as well as its negative aspects. The model invoked is actualised in aspects such as: a tendency of simplification, which follows the principle of economy in expression, without breaking the rules of correct writing; the fast access to information; the instant transmission of messages to several receivers at the same time; the creation of a new type of socialization, especially among the young generation. The anti-model refers to the use of a codified language, based on certain abbreviations and symbols understood only by experienced users or "the initiates"; the proliferation of erroneous forms of language, caused by the dropping of punctuation or diacritical marks, which produce ambiguous texts; erratic combination of registers; the lack of self-censorship in the so-called articles or postings containing vulgar words and expressions.

S	Wilks, Y		Gala, N; Rapp, R; BelEnguix, G		Wilks, Yorick			How Can Metaphors Be Interpreted Cross-Linguistically?	LANGUAGE PRODUCTION, COGNITION, AND THE LEXICON	Text Speech and Language Technology		English	Article; Book Chapter						Metaphor; Interlingua; Semantics; WordNet; Preference; Word-sense		Research on metaphor as a phenomenon amenable to the techniques of computational linguistics received a substantial boost from a recent US government funding initiative (iARPA, http://www.iarpa.gov/Programs/ia/Metaphor/metaphor.html) that set up a number of teams in major universities to address the issues of metaphor detection and interpretation on a large scale in text. Part of the stated goal of the project was to detect linguistic metaphors (LMs) computationally in texts in four languages and map them all to a single set of conceptual metaphors (CMs). Much of the inspiration for this was the classic work of George Lakoff (Lakoff and Johnson 1980) which posited a set of universal metaphors in use across cultures and languages. I wish to examine the assumptions behind this goal and in particular to address the issue of how and in what representation such CMs can be expressed. I shall argue that a naive approach to this issue is to make very much the same assumptions as the work of Schank and others in the 1970s: namely that there can be a universal language of "primitives'' for the expression of meaning, which in practice always turns out to be a form of simple English. Reviving that assumption for the study of metaphor raises additional issues since, even if the senses of the terms in those CM representations could be added to the representations, metaphors often deploy new senses of words which will not be found in existing sense inventories like computational lexicons. The paper is not intended just to present a negative conclusion; I also argue that the representation of metaphors in a range of languages can be brought together within some CM scheme, but that simply reviving the English-as-interlingua assumptions of 40 years ago is not a good way to make progress in this most difficult area of meaning computation. In what follows I discuss first the representation of CMs: in what language are they stated? I argue the need for some inclusion of the representation of the senses of their constituent terms within the CM, or at least a default assumption that the major sense (with respect to some lexicon such as WordNet) is the intended one. I then consider the issue of conventional metaphor and its representation in established lexicons (again such as WordNet) and the effect that can have on detection strategies for metaphor such as selectional preference breaking. I then argue that the mapping of text metaphors to CMs, as well as the empirical, rather than intuitive, construction of CM inventories require further use of preference restrictions in lexicons by means of a much-discussed process of projection or coercion. I conclude that only the use of (computable) procedures such as these for metaphor detection and mapping can lead to a plausible program for the large scale analysis of metaphor in text and that Lakoff's views on metaphor lack these empirical underpinnings.

This paper gives a corpus-based contrastive study from linguistic and discursive perspectives. Through using Fairclough's three-dimension model of text, discourse and social practice, especially from intertextuality levels, it firstly examines contrastively the textual features such as the lexical, rhetorical features as well as the concordance, cluster, and collocation.

It gives lexica-semantic characteristic of basic concepts in synchronism and diachrony. At the same time this work presents the picture of changes in the structures if basic concepts at different historical periods: the Age of the Enlightenment, epoch of German Empire, epoch of Peter the Great and Russian post revolution time. Basing on lexicographic analysis and discourse analysis we define some basic conceptual characteristics of the phenomenon of "Education" ("Bildung" / "Obrazovanie") and they are described according to the groups combined by one and the same semantics. The conclusion of the article shows that the concept of "Education" changes constantly and nowadays is greatly influenced by social, economic, political and cultural factors that lead to its transformation both in German and Russian linguocultures.

Detecting Emotions in Comments on Forums	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTERS COMMUNICATIONS & CONTROL			English	Article						sentiment analysis; language resources; emotions levels; semantic classes; Forums		The paper presents one of the most important issues in Natural Language Processing (NLP), emotion identification and classification to implement a computational technology based on existing resources, open-source or freely available for research purposes. Furthermore, we are interested to use it for establishing Gold standards in sentiment analysis area, such as SentiWordNet. In this sense, we propose to recognize and classify the emotions (sentiments) of the public consumer from the written texts which appeared on the various Forums. We analyse the writing style which refers to how consumers construct sentences together when they write comments to indicate their passion about an entity (persons, brand, location, etc.). We present in this paper a method for integrating Romanian lexical resources from emotional perspective, in developing, which can be used in sentiment analysis. This study is intend to help direct beneficiaries (public consumer, marketing managers, PR firms, politicians, investors), but, also, specialists and researchers in the field of natural language processing, linguists, psychologists, sociologists, economists, etc.	[Gifu, D.] Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Iasi 700483, Romania; [Cioca, M.] Lucian Blaga Univ Sibiu, Sibiu 550024, Romania		Gifu, D (corresponding author), Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, 16 Gen Berthelot St, Iasi 700483, Romania.	daniela.gifu@info.uaic.ro; marius.cioca@ulbsibiu.ro	Gifu, Daniela/D-1805-2015; CIOCA, Marius/B-5633-2011	Gifu, Daniela/0000-0001-8116-053X; Cioca, Marius/0000-0002-0466-9196	Erasmus Mundus Action 2 EMERGE Project [2011 2576 / 001 001 - EMA2]	In order to perform this research the first author received financial support from the Erasmus Mundus Action 2 EMERGE Project (2011 2576 / 001 001 - EMA2).

J	Bravo-Marquez, F; Mendoza, M; Poblete, B				Bravo-Marquez, Felipe; Mendoza, Marcelo; Poblete, Barbara			Meta-level sentiment models for big social data analysis	KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS			English	Article						Sentiment classification; Twitter; Meta-level features; Opinion mining; Social media	DOMAIN	People react to events, topics and entities by expressing their personal opinions and emotions. These reactions can correspond to a wide range of intensities, from very mild to strong. An adequate processing and understanding of these expressions has been the subject of research in several fields, such as business and politics. In this context, Twitter sentiment analysis, which is the task of automatically identifying and extracting subjective information from tweets, has received increasing attention from the Web mining community. Twitter provides an extremely valuable insight into human opinions, as well as new challenging Big Data problems. These problems include the processing of massive volumes of streaming data, as well as the automatic identification of human expressiveness within short text messages. In that area, several methods and lexical resources have been proposed in order to extract sentiment indicators from natural language texts at both syntactic and semantic levels. These approaches address different dimensions of opinions, such as subjectivity, polarity, intensity and emotion. This article is the first study of how these resources, which are focused on different sentiment scopes, complement each other. With this purpose we identify scenarios in which some of these resources are more useful than others. Furthermore, we propose a novel approach for sentiment classification based on meta-level features. This supervised approach boosts existing sentiment classification of subjectivity and polarity detection on Twitter. Our results show that the combination of meta-level features provides significant improvements in performance. However, we observe that there are important differences that rely on the type of lexical resource, the dataset used to build the model, and the learning strategy. Experimental results indicate that manually generated lexicons are focused on emotional words, being very useful for polarity prediction. On the other hand, lexicons generated with automatic methods include neutral words, introducing noise in the detection of subjectivity. Our findings indicate that polarity and subjectivity prediction are different dimensions of the same problem, but they need to be addressed using different subspace features. Lexicon-based approaches are recommendable for polarity, and stylistic part-of-speech based approaches are meaningful for subjectivity. With this research we offer a more global insight of the resource components for the complex task of classifying human emotion and opinion. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Woerfel, T; Koch, N; Woerfel, SY; Riehl, C				Woerfel, Till; Koch, Nikolas; Woerfel, Seda Yilmaz; Riehl, Claudia			Growing Up with Two Languages: What About Literacy?	LILI-ZEITSCHRIFT FUR LITERATURWISSENSCHAFT UND LINGUISTIK			German	Article						bilingualism; monoliteracy; biliteracy; discourse strategy; L1-instruction; bilingual education; extra linguistic factors		The value of additive mother tongue instruction for children with migration background has become a hot political issue. It has been assumed that L1-instruction has a positive effect on L2 competences. Yet these assumptions have not been investigated by systematic approaches that would consider a broader range of linguistic and extra-linguistic factors and their respective correlation. To explore this correlation, this paper presents a study on qualitative and quantitative multi-literacy skills of 28 bilingual 9th graders (with Turkish as a first language and German as an early L2) analyzing narrative and expository texts in two languages. The data is examined both from macro structural perspective, and considers lexico-semantic, syntactic and text organizing features, with the main focus centered on the correlation between positive transfer and language capability. The outcomes of the analysis are compared to the respective school curriculum, types and duration of L1 instructions (mother tongue instruction outside or as part of the school curriculum, bilingual educational programs and monolingual instruction in the dominant language only). The results show that mother tongue instruction is not sufficient to obtain a high enough degree of language proficiency to produce positive transfer. Pupils, who didn't visit L1 instruction courses, produce better texts. Positive effect of L1 on L2 and vice versa can only be found in the written text of pupils, who visited a bilingual educational program over a long period of time. It shows a higher degree of written skills especially in argumentative texts in L1. There are, however, additional extra linguistic factors which influence written text competence. Parents' education background doesn't show any influence on the text competences of pupils. As expected, pupils with higher degree of written skills in L1 narrative text were not as successful enough in producing argumentative texts in L1.

J	Ahn, JH				Ahn, Ji-Hyun			REARTICULATING BLACK MIXED-RACE IN THE ERA OF GLOBALIZATION Hines Ward and the struggle for Koreanness in contemporary South Korean media	CULTURAL STUDIES			English	Article						globalization; multiculturalism; national identity; racial politics; mixed-race; media discourse; Hines Ward; South Korea	GLOBAL MIGRATION; MULTICULTURALISM	Since the mid-2000s, the term multiculturalism has entered the Korean lexicon as migration has become more and more prevalent due to globalization. The cornerstone of this multicultural explosion was a 2006 visit by American football star Hines Ward, born to an African-American father and a Korean mother. As a black mixed-race sports celebrity, he suddenly became an emblematic media figure in the Korean televisual landscape, signifying a broader racial reconfiguration in Korean society. This media event - what I shall call 'the Hines Ward moment' - created and opened the discursive space for racial politics and multicultural issues in Korean society. Hence, this article aims to look at what this discursive explosion of multiculturalism and mixed-race means in the context of globalization. Reading the Hines Ward moment as a symbolic media text, the paper examines how the media discourse on Hines Ward articulates the issues of national identity and racial politics in contemporary Korean society. For analysis, newspaper articles, television programmes and television commercials that deal with the Hines Ward case are examined. By analyzing the modes of articulation of the Hines Ward moment, this study deconstructs the image of a 'global, multicultural Korea' shaped by the Korean media and examines the struggle for Koreanness in the televisual area of contemporary Korean media.

And although a selection of the political writings from the Historical and Critical Dictionary has been published, much of Bayle's political thought has not been translated. This translation complements recent editions of Bayle's Thoughts on the Comet and Philosophical Commentary, along with a forthcoming translation of his Conversations Between Maxime and Themiste. A substantial introduction explores the context and reviews scholarly interpretations, and notes to the text explain references.

Textual statistics have much to offer for uncovering such a strategy. We propose a methodology that starts from a non-structured text; first, the breakpoints are automatically detected and lexically homogeneous parts are identified; then, the shape of the text through the trajectory of these parts and their hierarchical structure are uncovered; finally, the argument flow is tracked along. Several methods are combined. Chronological clustering of multidimensional count series detects the breakpoints; the shape of the text is revealed by applying correspondence analysis to the partsxwords table while the progression of the argument is described by labelled time-constrained hierarchical clustering. This methodology is illustrated on a rhetoric forensic application, concretely a closing speech delivered by a prosecutor at Barcelona Criminal Court. This approach could also be useful in politics, communication and professional writing.

J	Ross, CS				Ross, Christopher S.			SHALL BUSINESSES PROFIT IF THEIR OWNERS LOSE THEIR SOULS? EXAMINING WHETHER CLOSELY HELD CORPORATIONS MAY SEEK EXEMPTIONS FROM THE CONTRACEPTIVE MANDATE	FORDHAM LAW REVIEW			English	Article							FREE EXERCISE; BURDENS; RELIGION; RIGHTS; SMITH	May for-profit, secular corporations claim the protection of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA)? This question is central to numerous lawsuits against the federal government in which business owners argue that certain regulations under the Patient Protection & Affordable Care Act substantially burden the exercise of their religion. This Note examines the threshold hurdle that for-profit business owners must clear to successfully state a claim under RFRA: the question of whether the businesses are "persons" the statute protects. This is an issue of first impression for the U.S. Supreme Court, and it has split the circuit courts of appeal. First, this Note provides an overview of free exercise jurisprudence, with a focus on the ebbs and flows of the Supreme Court's exemption doctrine. This overview includes a discussion of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act and the laws, regulations, and religious objections that form the basis of the current disputes. Second, this Note introduces the conflict among circuit courts and their varying interpretations of whether for-profit corporations are "persons" under RFRA. Third, this Note assesses this conflict by examining RFRA's text and the context in which Congress enacted the statute. Nothing within this context precludes corporations from stating RFRA claims. In addition, this Note examines legislative history that supports application of the Dictionary Act, which explains that the word "person" in federal statutes includes corporations. This Note ultimately concludes that RFRA does indeed grant corporations the ability to seek exemptions, but that the statute will require courts to undertake the task of ascertaining the proper contours of the law as applied to different corporate forms.

J	Zhang, JF				Zhang, Junfeng			From interpersonal to international: two types of translation in the making of implicitness in diplomatic discourse	PERSPECTIVES-STUDIES IN TRANSLATION THEORY AND PRACTICE			English	Article						implicitness; diplomatic discourse; interpersonal prominence; intra-lingual translation; inter-lingual translation		This article argues that constructing implicitness in diplomatic discourse involves intra-lingual translation in ST. It also argues that inter-lingually translating implicitness in diplomatic discourse sometimes involves a process of intra-lingual translation in TT. A review of implicitness in diplomatic discourse, which often demonstrates a scripted feature, shows that notions of ambiguity, fuzziness, generality, and vagueness put forward by Zhang (1998) can be employed to scrutinize the construction of implicitness via lexical choice. Viewed in terms of Hallidayian linguistics, the construction of implicitness, in both ST and TT, bears a strong interpersonal prominence. As shown in the analysis of the implicitness found in the diplomatic discourse around the 2001 Air-Collision Incident, the interpersonal prominence is governed by national interest concerns of the discourse producers. A tentative model of creating and translating lexical implicitness in diplomatic discourse is suggested. As illustrated in the model, the translation-engendered implicitness in diplomatic discourse is a textual manifestation of the interpersonal prominence in the international arena of foreign affairs.

Scientists in the area of text mining and natural language processing have studied sentiment fingerprints residing in text to extract the emotional polarity of customers for a product or to evaluate the popularity of politicians. Recent research focused on micro-blogging has found notable similarities between Twitter feeds and SMS (short message service) text messages. This paper investigates the common characteristics of both formats for sentiment analysis purposes and verifies the correctness of the similarity assumption. A lexicon-based approach is used to extract and compute the sentiment scores of SMS messages found on smartphones. The data is presented along a timeline that depicts a sender's emotional fingerprint. This form of analysis and visualization can enrich a forensic investigation by conveying potential psychological patterns from text messages.

This research explore and analyze how the way to obtain the public complaints information from tweets. Classification-based approach is done through two main tasks, namely named entity recognition and relation extraction. Named entity recognition experiment achieves highest f-measure of 85.6% with 8 sets of features, namely lexical, NE tags, elements of Twitter, orthography, token kind, gazetteer, clue list and stopword list. Meanwhile, relation extraction experiment achieves highest f-measure of 77.2% with 5 sets of features, namely lexical, NE tags, number of words, one word before the first entity and clue list. Maximum f-measure on the two main tasks is obtained by Sequential Minimum Optimization algorithm.

S	Ceglarek, D		Nguyen, NT		Ceglarek, Dariusz			Semantic Compression for Text Document Processing	TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTATIONAL COLLECTIVE INTELLIGENCE XIV	Lecture Notes in Computer Science		English	Article; Book Chapter						Semantic compression; Text clustering; Semantic network; Natural language processing; Information retrieval; Plagiarism detection; Knowledge acquisition		Ongoing research on novel methods and tools that can be applied in Natural Language Processing tasks has resulted in the design of a semantic compression mechanism. Semantic compression is a technique that allows for correct generalization of terms in some given context. Thanks to this generalization a common thought can be detected. The rules governing the generalization process are based on a data structure which is referred to as a domain frequency dictionary. Having established the domain for a given text fragment the disambiguation of possibly many hypernyms becomes a feasible task. Semantic compression, thus an informed generalization, is possible through the use of semantic networks as a knowledge representation structure. In the given overview, it is worth noting that the semantic compression allows for a number of improvements in comparison to already established Natural Language Processing techniques. These improvements, along with a detailed discussion of the various elements of algorithms and data structures that are necessary to make semantic compression a viable solution, are the core of this work. Semantic compression can be applied in a variety of scenarios, e.g. in detection of plagiarism. With increasing effort being spent on developing semantic compression, new domains of application have been discovered. What is more, semantic compression itself has evolved and has been refined by the introduction of new solutions that boost the level of disambiguation efficiency. Thanks to the remodeling of already existing data sources to suit algorithms enabling semantic compression, it has become possible to use semantic compression as a base for automata that, thanks to the exploration of hypernym-hyponym and synonym relations, new concepts that may be included in the knowledge representation structures can now be discovered.

J	Fiano, DA				Fiano, Darcy A.			Primary Discourse and Expressive Oral Language in a Kindergarten Student	READING RESEARCH QUARTERLY			English	Article							HOME LITERACY EXPERIENCES; VOCABULARY INSTRUCTION; SOCIOECONOMIC-STATUS; SKILLS; ACQUISITION; KNOWLEDGE; STORIES; SCHOOL	This seven-month ethnographic case study elucidated a kindergarten student's navigation through her first formal schooling experience with relation to expressive oral language. Gee's theory of Discourses and methodology of discourse analysis were used to examine expressive oral language in use. Two discursive contexts germane to expressive oral language were observed: Discourse of home and Discourse of school. This study demonstrated the complexity of expressive oral language when a primary Discourse converged with the secondary Discourse of school. Primary data sources included participant observation, audiotaped observations, and field notes, resulting in transcripts and an individual participant dictionary. Critical incidents of oral language samples were analyzed through language-in-use discourse analysis focused on the seven building tasks, significance, practices (activities), identities, relationships, politics, connections, and sign systems and knowledge, and six tools of inquiry, social languages, Discourses, Conversations, intertextuality, situated meanings, and figured worlds. Secondary data sources included interviews, document/artifact collection, and a researcher journal, providing detail for rich, descriptive narratives of contexts of her language in use and detailed descriptions of the home and school contexts and the participant in these settings. Data suggest that a kindergarten student's primary Discourse as it pertains to expressive oral language manifests itself in varying ways at the point of juncture with the secondary Discourse of school. Alignment, dominance, discord, and hybridity existed as her primary Discourse and school Discourse converged through expressive oral language. The point of juncture for expressive oral language expanded and limited her discursive abilities in both Discourses. ????,???????2004?2012???,??????????(CDA)???????????????????????????????????????????????????,??????????,????????????????????????????????,?????????????,????????,??????,????????????,???????????????????????????,???????????????????????????76????????????????????,?????????,???????????????????????,?????????????,?????????????????????????????,??????????????????????????;????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????:???????????,????????????????,?????????????????2005?????????????,??????????????????????????????,???????????????? Este articulo es un analisis critico e integrado de la literatura sobre estudios de alfabetizacion desde 2004 hasta 2012 que se sirve del analisis del discurso critico (CDA por sus siglas en ingles). Se discuten cuestiones clave, tendencias, y la critica del campo. Nuestra metodologia consta de tres fases. Primero, usamos bases de datos educacionales para encontrar investigacion sobre la alfabetizacion basada en CDA. Segundo, llenamos una plantilla de evaluacion critica para cada articulo y codificamos la informacion a una hoja de calculo digital para determinar macro tendencias en el campo. Tercero, desarrollamos esquemas para interpretar la complejidad de los problemas relacionados con el diseno de la investigacion. Nuestro examen de 76 estudios empiricos basados en la alfabetizacion y estudios teoricos en publicaciones academicas revela tendencias en las cuestiones que los investigadores consideran lo suficientemente interesante como para investigar, las teorias que consideran utiles, y el tipo de interacciones que les atrae la atencion. Nuestros resultados indican que la investigacion basada en CDA se ha hecho en muchas areas de estudios sobre la alfabetizacion, incluyendo polizas, escritura academica, el entrenamiento de maestros de alfabetizacion, el desarrollo profesional, el contenido de libros de texto, el diseno de cursos, el asesoramiento, y la educacion bilingue. Examinaos cuatro areas fundamentales en el campo que estan especialmente listas para el debate y la critica: contexto, reflexividad, accion social, y la postura de deconstruccion/construccion hacia la indagacion. En la discusion comparamos los resultados de este analisis de la literatura con un analisis anterior publicado en 2005, reflexionando sobre las tres decadas de CDA en los estudios de alfabetizacion. Identificamos direcciones para investigaciones futuras. ??? ????? ??? ?????? ???????? ???? ????? ???? ???? ????? ????? ?? ?????? ????? ??? ????? ????? ??? ??????? ??? ????? ??????? ???????. ??? ?? ??????? ????? ???????? ?????? ????? ?????? ??? ?? ???? ??????? ????? ??????? ???????. ??? ??? ?????? ?????? ??????? ??? ??? ????? ?????? ??????? ???????: ???? ????? ????? ??????. ?????? ??? ??????? ????? ????? ??????? ??????? ??? ????? ???? ????? ????? ????? ??????. ????? ????? ???????? ?????? ????????? ???????? ????? ?????? ???????? ??????? ????? ?? ??? ??? ????? ????? ?????? ????. ??? ?? ????? ????? ????? ?????? ????? ????? ?????? ????? ???? ??????? ????? ??????? ??? ?????? ?????? ?????? ???????? ??????????

Cet article est une revue critique de l'ensemble des etudes menees sur la litteratie de 2004 a 2012 qui s'appuie sur une analyse critique du discours (ACD). Y sont discutees les questions-cle, les tendances, et les critiques du champ. Nous avons procede en trois temps. Tout d'abord, nous avons examine les bases de donnees en education afin de localiser les travaux centres sur l'ACD de la litteratie. En second lieu, nous avons elabore un modele de revue analytique pour tous les articles et avons encode les donnees dans un fichier numerique afin d'evaluer les macro-tendances du champ. En troisieme lieu, nous avons developpe des schemas pour interpreter les questions complexes liees au dispositif de recherche. L'examen des 76 recherches empiriques centrees sur la litteratie ainsi que des textes theoriques dans les revues scientifiques fait apparaitre des tendances dans les questions que les chercheurs trouvent assez interessantes pour leur donner suite, les theories qu'ils trouvent utiles et les types d'interactions qui les interessent. Nos resultats montrent qu'une ACD a ete effectuee dans de nombreux domaines des etudes sur la litteratie, y inclus la politique, l'ecriture scientifique, la formation des maitres en litteratie, la formation professionnelle, le contenu des manuels, les programmes scolaires, l'evaluation et l'enseignement bilingue. Nous explorons quatre domaines fondamentaux dans ce champ qui sont particulierement propices au debat et a la critique: le contexte, la reflexivite, l'action sociale, et la position constructive-reconstructive envers l'enquete. Dans la discussion, nous comparons les resultats de cette revue de la litterature avec une revue de question precedente publiee en 2005, et reflechissons a trois decennies d'ACD dans les etudes de litteratie. Nous indiquons des pistes pour de futures recherches.

The mentalities of the community, the traditions and the prejudices have led to laws restricting the right of women to work, in general, or to practice certain professions. Regarding the professions exercised by women throughout history, there is in the Romanian language a rich terminological material, which can prove, on one hand, a socio-economic reality - persistent discrimination against working women, and on the other hand, the lexical processes underlying the structure of the class of feminine names of professions. The knowledge of the contemporary Romanian society's spirituality, of the nation's aspirations, is emphasized by the states in which the "working woman" appears. Moreover, sociologists emphasize the fact that, in time, although the women's emancipation led to the broadening of the horizon as far as choosing a profession goes, there continues to exist a clear discrimination against women in the practice of some professions and, especially, the possibility of occupying leadership positions. Our paper, made based on an inventory of terms excerpted from various documents of the sixteenth century - until the nineteenth century, but also from texts of the current Romanian language, highlights the fact that feminine names of professions represent a heterogeneous lexical group, both in terms of form and terms of provenance.

HOW CAN LANGUAGE TYPOLOGY DATABASES BE USEFUL IN STUDYING LANGUAGES?

Using the identification of relationship between languages methodology called Jazyki Mira ("Languages of the word") (JM) related to World Atlas of Language Structures (WALS) could be useful for making individual training programs based on the common knowledge of student's native language. These databases consists of chapters based on grammatical features and components of eight main sections: Phonology, Morphology, Noun category, Noun syntax, Verb categories, Word order, Simple sentence, Complex sentence. There are also sections on writing systems. Each section represents lexical typology. Russian language has options available in some languages but absents in other ones: e.g. there are no Uvular Consonants and Prefixes in Norwegian; Hindi has no Reduction of unstressed vowels; Dutch has no grammatical Neuter Gender; there are no grammatical categories of Aspect, Mood and Voice in Greek; using free Word order in a sentence is impossible in Chinese. Using data of language typology it is possible to compare abstract features of the language system across unrelated languages. The method of finding some similar linguistic realities in the student's native language contributes to rapid understanding and memorizing of the training material. Depending on what phonetic, grammatical and syntactical features of Russian exist in the student's native language you can develop the resource that will help the teacher in creating of certain textbooks and manuals. The work is performed according to the Russian Government Program of Competitive Growth of Kazan Federal University.

The observations cover more than 90 countries at two historical moments of climate change decision making: the pre-Kyoto Protocol enforcement (2001-2004) and the post-Kyoto Protocol (2008-2011) meetings. Data were collected from different types of written text. Coding entailed a qualitative (dictionary-based) content analysis and a quantitative text analysis. By systematically exploring these new data, I offer a 'map' of national preferences at the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). I also propose a discussion of the dimensions of conflict and policy competition over 10 years of climate negotiations.

Formation of the Standard Language: Macedonian	SLAVIC LANGUAGES, VOL 2: INTERNATIONAL HANDBOOK OF THEIR STRUCTURE, THEIR HISTORY AND THEIR INVESTIGATION	Handbucher zur Sprach und Kommunikationswissenschaft		English	Article; Book Chapter								In the 19th century a number of churchmen in Macedonia wrote sermons and primers in a form of Slavonic that was close to vernacular speech. These can be seen as the first texts of written Macedonian, although their authors did not intend to create a new literary language. The first document of explicit Macedonian linguistic and political separatism is Recnik od tri jezika (1875). In his book Za makedonckite raboti Krste P. Misirkov (1874-1926) advocated a literary language based on the Prilep-Bitola dialect, but the book was never distributed. After the partition of Macedonia (1913) Macedonian literary activity was tolerated in Bulgaria and Yugoslavia as "dialect literature". There were thriving theatre groups in Skopje and Sofia and Koco Racin from Veles wrote poetry that has retained its literary value. The communist partisans used the local dialects in their pamphlets in Vardar Macedonia during the Axis occupation and in 1944 they declared that Macedonian would be the official language of the new Macedonian republic. The decisive codificational steps were Koneski's grammar (1952-1954) and the 'academy dictionary' (1961-1966). Independence has terminated the Serbian/Macedonian diglossia that was characteristic of Vardar Macedonia in the 20th century. There have been various attempts to codify Macedonian in the diaspora.										20	0	0	0	0	DE GRUYTER MOUTON	BERLIN 11	GENTHINER STR 13, POSTF 110240, W-1000 BERLIN 11, GERMANY	1861-5090		978-3-11-021547-2; 978-3-11-017153-2	HANDB SPRACH KOMMUN			2014	32	2					1470	1477			10.1515/9783110215472		8	Linguistics; Language & Linguistics	Book Citation Index – Social Sciences & Humanities (BKCI-SSH)	Linguistics	BE5TY	WOS:000373428600030					2022-03-30

Despite significant advances in the automatic author profiling, the most of the research has been done on Germanic languages and not so much on morphologically rich languages. Consequently, this work is the first attempt at finding a good method for solving automatic author profiling in three dimensions for Lithuanian: age (6 categories), gender (2 categories) and political view (3 categories). To tackle this task we used the dataset, which contains text transcripts of Lithuanian parliamentary speeches and debates, thus representing formal spoken, but normative Lithuanian language. In our paper we explored different feature types (ultimate style markers, lexical, morphological, character, and aggregated) and dataset sizes (of 100, 200, 500, 1,000, 2,000, 5,000 instances in each category). The best results were obtained with Support Vector Machine method, the largest tested dataset and lemmas as features: i.e. 44.6% of accuracy for age with interpolation up to trigrams, 74.6% for gender and 58.7% for political view with interpolation up to bigrams.

Lexical and syntactic peculiarities of the official document texts produced by three British social departments (Government Equalities Office, which is part of the Department for Culture, Media and Sport; Department of Health; Department for Education) are analyzed in the work. In order to evaluate the complexity of grammar in the texts addressing the public and professional audience the following quantitative method was developed. It measures the number of auxiliary, notional and the general number of words in the sentences. It is assumed that there is a statistical correlation between the number of auxiliary words and the complexity of the sentence structure. Besides, a semantic analysis of lexical units showed that whenever possible a more neutral or informal word is used to present a notion in the texts addressing the public.

It is the first research of its kind carried out in the Irish context and begins to remedy the lack of empirical information about an important aspect of the linguistic demands that the Irish post-primary curriculum imposes on immigrant students. The chapter begins by outlining the rationale for the research and summarizing the aims of corpus analysis. It then describes the six textbooks-derived corpora and the methodological procedures employed to analyse them and presents the principal empirical findings. These include the most frequent content words together with their significant collocates, and the most frequent 4-word clusters in each corpus. Lexical features are discussed in relation to their semantic value and functional utility in individual corpora. Overall, the empirical analysis uncovers the lexical variation that exists across subjects and provides pedagogically important information on curriculum language as a whole. The conclusion notes some of the implications of the empirical findings for post-primary English language support in Ireland.

The paper also intends to discuss this phraseological concept from the following perspectives: 1. the linguistic level or levels at which one can speak of linguistic Europeanization, 2. the relation with terms like linguistic globalization, linguistic internationalization, 3. the possible differences between different European countries and cultures in dealing with these terms, 4. the consideration of the word Europeanization as a desideratum or as a simple and necessary institutional reality, etc. The theoretical remarks will be followed by the linguistic analysis (a lexical, derivative and phraseological one) of a text concerning with the communitarian legistation, in Romanian, French, English, Italian and, where possible, German. This analysis will try to demonstrate that the linguistic Europeanization is not just a matter of actuality, but it is also a result of an European cultural linguistic tradition.

The main problem in sentiment analysis for Indonesian text on social media is unstructured text data and the use of non-standard languages such that sentiment analysis often produces errors. This paper focuses on sentiment analysis using a hybrid model that combines lexicon based and maximum entropy methods to classify the sentiments of Indonesian public opinion on government. The method consists of extracting datasets, preprocessing, lexicon-based classification, machine learning training, machine learning classification, and result interpretation. The results of the study produce 91 classifications of neutral sentiment, 51 document negative sentiments, 39 document positive sentiments and 152 document of mix sentiments. Based on the evaluation results, the hybrid sentiment model for Indonesian Language sentiment analysis on social media produced a pretty good accuracy score of 84.31% compared to previous studies. The implication of this study is to produce a sentiment analysis system with a hybrid method for Indonesian text on social media.

J	Reyes, A				Reyes, Antonio			Bush, Obama: (in)formality as persuasion in political discourse	JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE AND POLITICS			English	Article						Political discourse; Bush; Obama; formality; style; intertextuality; persuasion	VOICE	This paper, framed under the scope of Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA), explains social processes by analyzing discourse practices. It proposes (para) linguistic variables employed in the creation of (in) formality in discourse in relation to two Aristotelian persuasive modes: Ethos and Pathos (Kennedy 1991). These modes of persuasion reveal different ways to convey a political message in the current U.S. political scene. This paper compares the stylistic differences in speeches given by George W. Bush and Barack Obama to justify escalating troops in the conflicts of Iraq (2007) and Afghanistan (2009), respectively. I propose (para) linguistic indicators of formality associated with Aristotelian modes at the level of linguistic choices ("lexical variables" [Schilling-Estes 2004] and "marked register usages" [Myers-Scotton 2001]), textual organization (structure and predictability), non-verbal communication (i.e. laughter; Jefferson, Sacks & Schegloff 1987), and intertextuality (Blackledge 2005; Fairclough 1992, 2003) by means of new voices (Bakhtin 1981) into the here-and-now moment of discourse.

In Nenek, speakers, linguistic associations, government instances and researchers work together to construct a centralized repository of materials about the Huastec language. Nenek not only organizes different types of contents in repositories, it also uses this information to create online tools such as a searchable database with documents on Huastec language and culture, E-dictionaries and spell checkers. Nenek is also a monolingual social network in which users discuss contents on the platform. Until now, the speakers have created a monolingual E-dictionary and we have initiated an on-going process of the construction of a repository of written texts in the Huastec language. In this context, we have been able to localize and digitally archive documents in other formats (audios, videos, images), yet the retrieval, creation, storage, and documentation of this type of materials is still in a preliminary phase. In this presentation, we want to present the general methodology of the project.

Tunisian Arabic is an under-resourced language. It has neither a standard orthography nor large collections of written text and dictionaries. Actually, there is no strict separation between Modern Standard Arabic, the official language of the government, media and education, and Tunisian Arabic; the two exist on a continuum dominated by mixed forms. In this paper, we present a conventional orthography for Tunisian Arabic, following a previous effort on developing a conventional orthography for Dialectal Arabic (or CODA) demonstrated for Egyptian Arabic.

J	Burn, CR				Burn, C. R.			Calton Point or Catton Point? A Misprinted Toponym on the Yukon Coast	ARCTIC			English	Article						Calton Point; Catton Point; John Franklin; Arctic toponymy; Herschel Island		Capt. John Franklin's account of his journey along the western Arctic coast of North America presents two spellings of the toponym he gave to the point at the eastern end of Workboat Passage, the strait between Herschel Island and the mainland. "Pt. Catton" is printed in the text, and "Pt. Calton" on the accompanying map compiled by Lt. E.N. Kendall. One of these must be a misprint. Catton Point and Calton Point have been used by the National Topographic System and on Canadian hydrographic charts. Calton Point was adopted by the Government of Canada for use in November 1962. However, Catton Point is almost certainly the intended toponym after the Rev. Thomas Catton, FRS (c. 1758-1838), President of St. John's College, Cambridge (1819-22), and tutor when John F.W. Herschel arrived at the college in 1809. Catton was one of 13 fellows of the Royal Society honoured by Franklin in northern Yukon. No Calton has ever been elected to the Royal Society or included in the Dictionary of National Biography.

In this article, we present an indepth analysis of Web search queries for controversial topics, focusing on query sentiment. To this end, we conduct extensive user assessments and discriminative term analyses, as well as a sentiment analysis using the SentiWordNet thesaurus, a lexical resource containing sentiment annotations. Furthermore, in order to detect the sentiment expressed in queries, we build different classifiers based on query texts, query result titles, and snippets. We demonstrate the virtue of query sentiment detection in two different use cases. First, we define a query recommendation scenario that employs sentiment detection of results to recommend additional queries for polarized queries issued by search engine users. The second application scenario is controversial topic discovery, where query sentiment classifiers are employed to discover previously unknown topics that trigger both highly positive and negative opinions among the users of a search engine. For both use cases, the results of our evaluations on real-world data are promising and show the viability and potential of query sentiment analysis in practical scenarios.

J	Perez-Llantada, C				Perez-Llantada, Carmen			The Article of the future: Strategies for genre stability and change	ENGLISH FOR SPECIFIC PURPOSES			English	Article						Genre analysis; Research articles; Genre and media; Rhetoric and composition; ESP pedagogy	ACADEMIC ATTRIBUTION; APPLIED LINGUISTICS; LEXICAL BUNDLES; CONSTRUCTION; CITATION; STUDENT	This article compares the Article of the Future (AofF) prototypes (<http://www.articleofthefuture.com/>) with a corpus of journal articles (Journal Article Corpus - JAC) to demonstrate that the article genre in an online environment is a "stabilised-for-now or stabilised-enough" site for social interaction (Schryer, 1994, p. 108). Results show that the prototypes adhere to the typical structural patterns of the JAC texts, while also embedding discernible structural variations across the disciplinary spectrum. They display generic stability concerning authors' use of intertextuality for framing their texts in a social/institutional context. Comparison of the AofF with the JAC texts also illustrates a similar lexicogrammatical profile. Consistent with previous literature, recurring bundles in the AofF prototypes are associated with structural elaboration, complexity and a compressed style, and perform referential, text-organising and stance functions in the discourse. Complementing corpus findings, an exploratory survey of authors suggests that their actual text-composing/reading practices of online articles are governed by the long-established communicative purposes of the genre. Findings suggest, though, that the new online part-genres (research highlights, graphical abstracts, interactive graphs, embedded videos, hyperlinks), potential strategies for generic change, might be changing the writers' perceptions towards online articles. The article concludes with some practical implications for ESP practitioners. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Ensuring de-identification is a pre-requisite for use of EHR data without prior consent. The South London and Maudsley NHS Trust (SLaM), one of the largest secondary mental healthcare providers in Europe, has developed, from its EHRs, a de-identified psychiatric case register, the Clinical Record Interactive Search (CRIS), for secondary research. Methods: We describe development, implementation and evaluation of a bespoke de-identification algorithm used to create the register. It is designed to create dictionaries using patient identifiers (PIs) entered into dedicated source fields and then identify, match and mask them (with ZZZZZ) when they appear in medical texts. We deemed this approach would be effective, given high coverage of PI in the dedicated fields and the effectiveness of the masking combined with elements of a security model. We conducted two separate performance tests i) to test performance of the algorithm in masking individual true PIs entered in dedicated fields and then found in text (using 500 patient notes) and ii) to compare the performance of the CRIS pattern matching algorithm with a machine learning algorithm, called the MITRE Identification Scrubber Toolkit - MIST (using 70 patient notes - 50 notes to train, 20 notes to test on). We also report any incidences of potential breaches, defined by occurrences of 3 or more true or apparent PIs in the same patient's notes (and in an additional set of longitudinal notes for 50 patients); and we consider the possibility of inferring information despite de-identification. Results: True PIs were masked with 98.8% precision and 97.6% recall. As anticipated, potential PIs did appear, owing to misspellings entered within the EHRs. We found one potential breach. In a separate performance test, with a different set of notes, CRIS yielded 100% precision and 88.5% recall, while MIST yielded a 95.1% and 78.1%, respectively. We discuss how we overcome the realistic possibility - albeit of low probability - of potential breaches through implementation of the security model. Conclusion: CRIS is a de-identified psychiatric database sourced from EHRs, which protects patient anonymity and maximises data available for research. CRIS demonstrates the advantage of combining an effective de-identification algorithm with a carefully designed security model. The paper advances much needed discussion of EHR de-identification - particularly in relation to criteria to assess de-identification, and considering the contexts of de-identified research databases when assessing the risk of breaches of confidential patient information.

In doing so, they have introduced a new term into the mental health lexicon: "the voice-hearer." Aims: This article offers a "thick description" of the figure of "the voice-hearer." Method: A selection of prominent texts (life narratives, research papers, videos and blogs), the majority produced by people active in the Hearing Voices or consumer/survivor/ex-patient movements, were analysed from an interdisciplinary medical humanities perspective. Results: "The voice-hearer" (i) asserts voice-hearing as a meaningful experience, (ii) challenges psychiatric authority and (iii) builds identity through sharing life narrative. While technically accurate, the definition of "the voice-hearer" as simply "a person who has experienced voice-hearing or auditory verbal hallucinations" fails to acknowledge that this is a complex, politically resonant and value-laden identity. Conclusions: The figure of "the voice-hearer" comes into being through a specific set of narrative practices as an "expert by experience" who challenges the authority and diagnostic categories of mainstream psychiatry, especially the category of "schizophrenia."

J	Baskovic, A				Baskovic, Aleksandar			Yugonostalgia and Yugoslav Cultural Memory: Lexicon of Yu Mythology	SLAVIC REVIEW			English	Article								Aleksandar Boskovic argues that the Yugonostalgia in the Lexicon of Yu Mythology should be taken, not as a regressive idealization of the Yugoslav socialist past, but as a critical intervention in both the contemporary postsocialist politics of memory and the politics of emancipation. Boskovic identifies the Lexicon as an exhibition catalogue of the virtual museum of all "things Yugoslav," a self-reflective postmodern hybrid emerging from the semantic overlapping of different genres and threaded with various memories, personal and collective, nostalgic and ironic, of everyday life in Yugoslav socialism. Boskovic contends that by evoking visual and textual reflections on the meaning of the past for the present, the Lexicon appears to have a materiality akin to that of a ruin: it exhibits a blend of affectionate and ironic nostalgia for the Yugoslav past, while simultaneously performing and reaffirming the socialist modernity's prospective perspective as its emancipating impact on the social imagination.

J	Craig, R; Mortensen, T; Iyer, S				Craig, Russell; Mortensen, Tony; Iyer, Shefali			Exploring Top Management Language for Signals of Possible Deception: The Words of Satyam's Chair Ramalinga Raju	JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS			English	Article						CEO; Deception; DICTION; India; Language; Letters; Linguistics; Risk; Tone		This paper explores the potential for systematic scrutiny of the language of top management to reveal signals of possible deceptive conduct. The language used in letters signed by Ramalinga Raju, Chair of the Indian multi-national company Satyam, are analysed using a multi-method quantitative approach. We explore the language in Raju's annual report letters from 2002-2003 to 2007-2008; and in his letter of January 7, 2009 in which he confessed to deceptive conduct. We analyse the frequency of personal pronouns, the tone of positivity or negativity, the frequency of words of extreme emotion and aspects of the characteristics of language use indicated by the DICTION 5.0 text analysis master variable, CERTAINTY. The text of Raju's letters appears to have been influenced by his self-confessed deceptive behaviour. Raju's word choice changed noticeably in his five annual report letters prior to the collapse of Satyam as the scale and impact of his financial misstatements increased. The methods presented should be considered for adoption by auditors and regulators-as a way of assessing whether signals emerging from language use warrant closer (including audit) scrutiny of a firm's financial reporting and governance. They should also be considered for use by monitors of entity risk, such as credit rating agencies and financial analysts.

J	Fielding, M				Fielding, Michael			Whole School Meetings and the Development of Radical Democratic Community	STUDIES IN PHILOSOPHY AND EDUCATION			English	Article						Democracy; Fellowship; Radical; Participation; School Meetings	EDUCATION; PHILOSOPHY	Serious re-examination of participatory traditions of democracy is long overdue. Iconically central to such traditions of democratic education is the practice of whole School Meetings. More usually associated with radical work within the private sector, School Meetings are here explored in detail through two examples from publicly funded education, (1) Epping House School, a mixed residential primary/elementary school for students with severe emotional, social and behavioural difficulties and (2) secondary/high schools within the Just Community School movement in the USA. In addition to providing richly textured accounts of the multiple realities and challenges of pioneering overtly democratic practices such as School Meetings within the publicly funded sector of education substantial attention is paid to analytic engagement with the kind of organisational structures, practices and cultures that seem to play an important role in their successful operation and development. The different phenomenological and theoretical strands weaving their way through the texture of Meeting practices also raise a number of key issues within the fields of social and political philosophy, in particular, whether School Meetings are best understood as predominantly political or communal phenomena. In gesturing towards the philosophical groundwork of a satisfactory answer I argue for the importance of the undeservedly neglected notion of democratic fellowship within the lexicon of democratic polity and aspiration.

J	Durham, MG				Durham, Meenakshi Gigi			"VICIOUS ASSAULT SHAKES TEXAS TOWN" The politics of gender violence in The New York Times' coverage of a schoolgirl's gang rape	JOURNALISM STUDIES			English	Article						critical textual analysis; feminist praxis; gender; misogyny; rape; The New York Times	BLAME	In March 2011, The New York Times reported the serial gang rape of a schoolgirl in the small town of Cleveland, Texas. Responses to the story were swift and damning: bloggers and commentators quickly identified the patriarchal and victim-blaming aspects of The Times' coverage, resulting in an influential petition and an apology from The Times. This study employs critical textual analysis to interrogate the critical responses to The Times story. The analysis reveals that commentators recognized misogynist bias in The Times' reporter's use of sources and quotes, the lexical structures in the text, and the strategic elision of race as a present absence in the news article. This analysis concludes that in channeling feminist conceptual tropes, the bloggers and commentators engaged in feminist praxis, raising awareness of patriarchal frames for sexual violence as well as galvanizing progressive action. But the study also points to a continued need for vigilance and feminist activism around sexual violence and child abuse.

We compare state-of-the-art SA methods against a novel hybrid method. The hybrid method utilizes a Sentiment Lexicon to generate a new set of features to train a linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. We further illustrate that our hybrid method outperforms the state-of-the-art unigram baseline.

J	Fu, XH; Liu, G; Guo, YY; Wang, ZQ				Fu Xianghua; Liu Guo; Guo Yanyan; Wang Zhiqiang			Multi-aspect sentiment analysis for Chinese online social reviews based on topic modeling and HowNet lexicon	KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS			English	Article						Aspect detection; Sentiment analysis; Social reviews; Topic modeling; HowNet lexicon	CLASSIFICATION	User-generated reviews on the Web reflect users' sentiment about products, services and social events. Existing researches mostly focus on the sentiment classification of the product and service reviews in document level. Reviews of social events such as economic and political activities, which are called social reviews, have specific characteristics different to the reviews of products and services. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised approach to automatically discover the aspects discussed in Chinese social reviews and also the sentiments expressed in different aspects. The approach is called Multi-aspect Sentiment Analysis for Chinese Online Social Reviews (MSA-COSRs). We first apply the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model to discover multi-aspect global topics of social reviews, and then extract the local topic and associated sentiment based on a sliding window context over the review text. The aspect of the local topic is identified by a trained LDA model, and the polarity of the associated sentiment is classified by HowNet lexicon. The experiment results show that MSA-COSR cannot only obtain good topic partitioning results, but also help to improve sentiment analysis accuracy. It helps to simultaneously discover multi-aspect fine-grained topics and associated sentiment. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Kong, JWP				Kong, Judy Wai Ping			Different times, different translations Translation of notices in Hong Kong	BABEL-REVUE INTERNATIONALE DE LA TRADUCTION-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TRANSLATION			English	Article						notices; English-Chinese translation; Hong Kong government; language policy		The varying sociohistorical contexts of Hong Kong which was ceded as a colony to the British in the mid-nineteenth century and returned to the Chinese in the late twentieth century have shaped different language policies, which in turn have ascribed a growing importance to the use of Chinese in society and established various normative requirements for its use accordingly. This article endeavors to show how sociohistorical factors have governed the use of Chinese in the translation of two kinds of notices, one published in The Hong Kong Government Gazette, which is aimed at giving publicity to the orders issued by the government, and the other posted in public places. Drawing on bilingual samples of these notices, it will examine how English notices conveying a similar message but written in different periods of the history of Hong Kong have been translated into Chinese and whether the translations are acceptable to the receivers of the target texts. Regarding the translation of notices from the government gazette, it will, firstly, investigate how an English notice can be modified stylistically, syntactically and lexically since the Chinese translation incorporates some conventionalized textual features of the classical language, and secondly, discuss how the classical language as the medium of translation has gradually given way to the vernacular. As for the translation of notices posted in public, it will scrutinize Chinese texts which exhibit the interfering effect of the linguistic habit of the English, meanwhile presenting some examples showing how Chinese poetic devices are employed to evoke a sense of familiarity. It will affirm by way of conclusion that there are diverse views on the way to do translation under altered sociohistorical conditions.

However, the technology is still in its nascent state. Distilling sentiment information from unstructured sources has turned out to be a complicated and strongly domain-dependent problem. To emulate the human ability to recognize financial sentiments in natural language by using machines, we need to provide them with (i) necessary ontological knowledge on the relevant domain-concepts; and (ii) learning strategies that help the machines to combine this knowledge with the syntactic structures extracted from text. In this paper, we present a knowledge-driven tree kernel framework for sentence-level analysis of financial news sentiments. Comparisons with linear kernels and classical lexicon-based systems suggest that significant performance gains can be achieved by incorporating information on financial concepts and their grammatical context The framework is decomposable into learning, knowledge and syntactic structure components. Contribution of each part is separately examined using a human-annotated phrase-bank with close to 5000 sentences collected across a number of financial news sources. The proposed sentiment analysis framework is flexible and can be applied also outside financial domain. To evaluate cross-domain performance, a further comparison of the algorithms is done with datasets from non-financial domains including movie reviews and general political discussions.

J	Ndlovu, MV				Ndlovu, Manqoba Victor			The translation of non-lexicalised words/terms by isiZulu health-text translators	SOUTHERN AFRICAN LINGUISTICS AND APPLIED LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article								The translators of isiZulu health texts very often have to deal with translation problems emanating from words or terms which are not yet lexicalised or which are problematic in isiZulu, such as the translation of terms relating to diseases, drugs/ointments and other medical concepts. This article focuses mainly on the use of vocabulary in solving these translation problems, with the aim of describing the decisions taken by translators. The health texts used in this article were collected between 2003 and 2006 from two South African provinces where isiZulu is spoken Gauteng and KwaZulu-Natal - as available at the distribution outlets of the national and provincial governments as well as from Soul City (a non-governmental organisation which entails a multimedia health-promotion and social-change project). The translation strategies as used by the isiZulu translators in solving the problem of non-lexicalised words/terms are examined by employing a combination of wordlist and concordance tools as well as by examining the titles of the texts. The results indicate that the translators' decisions demonstrated an attempt to use acceptable expressions by conforming to the grammatical rules and patterns of the target language (isiZulu).

The present study aims to point out that the absence of an agreed, unified orthographic system has led to the emergence of multiple non-systematic typographic conventions and accordingly to the inconsistent representation of the dialect in written discourse. Consequently, it is shown that a general confusion regarding the "correct" orthography of the dialect prevails, while numerous debates have been raised among linguists and lexicographers underpinned by contradictory language ideologies and political stances. Finally, the lack of Unicode characters and/or a correctly designed typeface including a number of special characters to support Greek-Cypriot (henceforth GC) generated numerous problems for publishers who turned to using alternative, time-consuming and amateur practices which do not meet the basic rules of microtypography.				ioli.ayiomamitou@cut.ac.cy						23	3	3	0	1	VERLAG DR KOVAC GMBH	HAMBURG	LEVERKUSENSTR 13, HAMBURG, 22761, GERMANY	1435-6570		978-3-8300-7103-7	PHILOL-SPRACHWISS			2013	176						87	100					14	Linguistics; Language & Linguistics	Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science &amp; Humanities (CPCI-SSH)	Linguistics	BJL64	WOS:000328914800007					2022-03-30

These texts belong to the written news style. The language of classified ads represents a "sub-system" of language denoting (and also making the difference!) lexical elements, idiomatic units or set phrases, cliches with a determined meaning in a certain context. In most cases, the use of stereotypes expresses a certain idea: thus, some ads may refer to sale, to purchase, to exchange, etc. Although there have been many attempts to set language within the limits of certain geographical areas and distinct political contexts, reality (also captured in the language of newspapers) proves that, regardless of the historical period or the external factors, it remains a constant value of expression.

J	Perc, M				Perc, Matjaz			Evolution of the most common English words and phrases over the centuries	JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY INTERFACE			English	Article						Zipf's law; preferential attachment; English language	SMALL-WORLD; LANGUAGE; NETWORKS; DYNAMICS; DISTRIBUTIONS; EMERGENCE; PATTERNS; LAWS	By determining the most common English words and phrases since the beginning of the sixteenth century, we obtain a unique large-scale view of the evolution of written text. We find that the most common words and phrases in any given year had a much shorter popularity lifespan in the sixteenth century than they had in the twentieth century. By measuring how their usage propagated across the years, we show that for the past two centuries, the process has been governed by linear preferential attachment. Along with the steady growth of the English lexicon, this provides an empirical explanation for the ubiquity of Zipf's law in language statistics and confirms that writing, although undoubtedly an expression of art and skill, is not immune to the same influences of self-organization that are known to regulate processes as diverse as the making of new friends and World Wide Web growth.

Consequently, such studies remain inconclusive regarding whether motor brain structures are recruited directly in language processing or through post-linguistic conceptual imagery. In the present study, we introduce a grip-force sensor that allows online measurements of language-induced motor activity during sentence listening. We use this tool to investigate whether language-induced motor activity remains constant or is modulated in negative, as opposed to affirmative, linguistic contexts. Methodology/Principal Findings: Participants listened to spoken action target words in either affirmative or negative sentences while holding a sensor in a precision grip. The participants were asked to count the sentences containing the name of a country to ensure attention. The grip force signal was recorded continuously. The action words elicited an automatic and significant enhancement of the grip force starting at approximately 300 ms after target word onset in affirmative sentences; however, no comparable grip force modulation was observed when these action words occurred in negative contexts. Conclusions/Significance: Our findings demonstrate that this simple experimental paradigm can be used to study the online crosstalk between language and the motor systems in an ecological and economical manner. Our data further confirm that the motor brain structures that can be called upon during action word processing are not mandatorily involved; the crosstalk is asymmetrically governed by the linguistic context and not vice versa.

J	Bulut, A				Bulut, Alev			Translating Political Metaphors: Conflict Potential of zenci [negro] in Turkish-English	META			English	Article						politics; political metaphor; interview; conflict; ideology		Political metaphors are expressed by lexical items with political content. Their transfer into other languages as part of political texts involves a potential of conflict due to their political and ideological load. Political interviews that are published through interpretation may be used to exemplify how transfer of source metaphors involve conflict depending on the translational decisions. This article focuses on the transfer of a political metaphor in an interpreter-mediated political interview as a source of potential conflict. The article first presents the concept of ideology in translation and markers of ideology in relation to political correctness and conflict as ideological aspects of political translation. It then focuses on zenci [negro/nigger] in Turkish as a political metaphor in transfer into English. The background for and the analysis of the sample metaphor in source and target languages, as well as the conclusions driven out of this case, aim to set the grounds for future discussions of similar cases in Turkish-English political translation.

J	Truschke, A				Truschke, Audrey			Defining the Other: An Intellectual History of Sanskrit Lexicons and Grammars of Persian	JOURNAL OF INDIAN PHILOSOPHY			English	Article						Sanskrit; Persian; Grammars; Lexicons; Mughal; Intellectual history	TRANSLATION	From the fourteenth to the eighteenth centuries, Indian intellectuals produced numerous Sanskrit-Persian bilingual lexicons and Sanskrit grammatical accounts of Persian. However, these language analyses have been largely unexplored in modern scholarship. Select works have occasionally been noticed, but the majority of such texts languish unpublished. Furthermore, these works remain untheorized as a sustained, in-depth response on the part of India's traditional elite to tremendous political and cultural changes. These bilingual grammars and lexicons are one of the few direct, written ways that Sanskrit intellectuals attempted to make sense of Indo-Persian culture in premodern and early modern India. Here I provide the most comprehensive account to date of the texts that constitute this analytical tradition according to three major categories: general lexicons, full grammars, and specialized glossaries. I further draw out the insights offered by these materials into how early modern thinkers used language analysis to try to understand the growth of Persian on the subcontinent.

Building such systems requires automatic detection of lexico-semantic event structures governed by the syntactic and semantic constraints of human languages in sentences of biomedical texts. The lexico-semantic event structures in sentences are centered around the predicates and most semantic role labeling (SRL) approaches focus only on the arguments of verb predicates and neglect argument taking nouns which also convey information in a sentence. In this article, a noun argument structure (NAS) annotated corpus named BioNom and a SRL system to identify and classify these structures is introduced. Also, a genetic algorithm-based feature selection (GAFS) method is introduced and global inference is applied to significantly improve the performance of the NAS Bio SRL system.

J	Cohen, SJ				Cohen, Shuki J.			Construction and Preliminary Validation of a Dictionary for Cognitive Rigidity: Linguistic Markers of Overconfidence and Overgeneralization and their Concomitant Psychological Distress	JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLINGUISTIC RESEARCH			English	Article						Cognitive rigidity; Overgeneralization; Text-analysis; Corpus-linguistics; Autobiographical narratives; Psychological distress	ATTRIBUTIONAL STYLE QUESTIONNAIRE; BORDERLINE PERSONALITY-DISORDER; BECK DEPRESSION INVENTORY; ARTICULATED THOUGHTS; SOCIAL-PSYCHOLOGY; DEFENSE STYLES; SELF-REPORT; DYSFUNCTIONAL ATTITUDES; EMOTIONAL INFORMATION; DISCRIMINANT VALIDITY	Fanaticism and extremism are increasingly recognized as seminal to psychopathology and distress, especially considering the increase in political unrest and violence over the last decade. In the psychopathological literature, however, the cognitive style associated with extremism and overgeneralization has long been recognized as a risk factor for emotional distress, leading to both externalizing behavior (e.g. aggression) and internalizing pathology (e.g. depression). Despite its recognized importance, however, virtually no standardized measures of this cognitive style exist. Since direct inquiry about a respondent's Cognitive Rigidity, is likely to be biased, a text-analytical measure of extremism in spontaneous autobiographical narratives is proposed. In contrast to self-reports, naturally occurring speech often suggests cognitive proclivities towards overgeneralization, overconfidence or extremization. In this study, spoken autobiographical narratives were elicited from 483 participants, and contrasted with extensive mental health information using a hierarchical concordanced-keyword technique. The resulting corpus-based dictionary is context-sensitive, and exhibits significant correlations with measures of negative emotionality, with minimal association with response bias measures.

At its core, the Semantic Web consists of ontologies that describe the meaning of concepts in a certain domain or across domains. The domain ontologies are mostly created and maintained by domain experts using manual, time-intensive processes. In this paper, we propose a rule-based method for learning ontology instances from text that helps domain experts with the ontology population process. In this method we define a lexico-semantic pattern language that, in addition to the lexical and syntactical information present in lexico-syntactic rules, also makes use of semantic information. We show that the lexico-semantic patterns are superior to lexico-syntactic patterns with respect to efficiency and effectivity. When applied to event relation recognition in text-based news items in the domains of finance and politics using Hermes, an ontology-driven news personalization service, our approach has a precision and recall of approximately 80% and 70%, respectively.

In this paper, we employ a modified version of the Technology Acceptance Model(TAM), a model which has been widely used and empirically validated to explain why individuals use a particular information technology(IT). This paper proposes that additional variables, such as educational impacts, contents quality, interaction and enjoyment, enhance our understanding of behaviors of pilot school teachers in using multimedia-based digital textbooks as a substitute for traditional paper-version of textbooks. A structural equation model is employed with survey data from 157 pilot school teachers in pilot program supported by Korean government and KERIS(Korea Education & Research Information Service), to empirically assess the strength of the relationships in the proposed model. It is hoped that the results from this study provide meaningful insight into the development and delivery of high quality digital textbooks.

Both novels are narrated by their female protagonists, whose movement between linguistic planes defines a distinctively feminized, translingual identity. Each works to destabilize the assumed relationship between language and national belonging, in part by recasting London as a space of translation: a city of immigrants defined by its polyglossia, and a node in a deterritorialized transnational linguistic order. Yet, while both novels explore the possibilities, risks, and limitations of a life lived between languages, they also demonstrate that translational literature, like translation theory, offers no consensus on the practice of translation. Their divergent conclusions - about the relationship between languages, about the nature and purposes of translation, about the connections between language and truth - reveal much about the complexities of translational writing.

J	Foulquier, L				Foulquier, Luc			Word routes: The prefix "Eco" and ecology	ENVIRONNEMENT RISQUES & SANTE			French	Article						ecology; environment; terminology		Word routes: The prefix "Eco" and ecology Ecology existed well before the French word was created for it in 1866 (the English word dates from 1873, according to the Oxford English Dictionary). This science and its vocabulary have developed greatly since then. The prefix "eco" (oikos: habitat) has increasingly been used in French to meet the need to link humans to their environment. The French Committee for Terminology and Neologisms related to the Environment has seized upon this new aspect to undertake to define a series of words starting with "eco" that are now found in numerous texts. In view of the profusion of this vocabulary, it has been proposed that these words be classified according to the domain in which they are used: scientific, technical, economic, industrial, political, societal, advertising-related, etc. This method has the advantage of specifying the meaning given to a word and of placing it in a context to clarify the debate. It is nonetheless true that the explosion of the use of the prefix "eco" and of ecology in French is now a historical fact.

J	Gamal, A				Gamal, Ahmed			Postcolonial Translation as Transformation Ahdaf Soueif's I Think of You	TRANSLATOR			English	Article						Postcolonial translation; Postcolonial literature; Transformation; Cultural translation; Sexual politics; Radical bilingualism		Like translation, postcolonial writing involves an act of mediating across languages and cultures. Texts written in English by bilingual anglophone writers often include strategies of transformation similar to those used by politically engaged translators to render the linguistic and cultural specificity of their source cultures. This paper examines this practice in the writing of the Egyptian novelist and cultural critic, Ahdaf Soueif (1950 -). It discusses how in addressing a global audience of English speakers, Soueif avoids editorial intrusions and relies extensively on lexical borrowing, contextualization, historical and geographical references, colloquial conversational formulas, culture-distinct metaphors and idioms, relexification and grammatical deviation - all of which enable her English text to accommodate the Arabic language and culture. The paper argues that Soueif's representation of the personal dilemmas of her female characters, including their physical embodiment, transgresses the dividing line between the private and the public and the sexual and the political in the Islamic-Arab world. In this way, Soueif's delineation of female private experience in her semi-autobiographical fiction functions as a kind of cultural translation.

J	Delsigne, J				Delsigne, Jill			Reading Catholic Art in Edmund Spenser's Temple of Isis	STUDIES IN PHILOLOGY			English	Article								This article investigates Spenser's Egyptian lexicon for the Catholic veneration of sacred images in the Temple of Isis in book 5 of the Faerie Queene. Though not Catholic, Spenser salvages the spiritual power of material objects for his own literary project. By deploying Egyptian mythology as the setting for Britomart's dream vision of English Empire, Spenser sketches a translatio imperii from Egypt to Rome and from Rome to England, a transfer not only of political but also of religious power; for England to vie for the inheritance of the Roman Empire, it had to show a lineage to Rome, just as Britomart's dream vision shows Queen Elizabeth's ancestry. I argue that in her dream vision, Britomart can be seen not only as Isis but also as the Virgin Mary. Spenser's emphasis on the spiritual power of the Isis statue to transform Britomart leads me to a contemporary title-page image in John Dee's Monas Hieroglyphica. The textual and visual correlations between the Isis statue and Dee's monad testify to a shared reverence for the power of material objects in early modern England's Protestant culture. The Faerie Queene educates readers, like Britomart, to recognize the difference between sacred art and empty idolatry-to resist seduction by Busirane's statue of Cupid and to acknowledge the power of Isis.

J	Ahmad, M; Gruner, S; Afzal, MT				Ahmad, Mushtaq; Gruner, Stefan; Afzal, Muhammad Tanvir			Computational Analysis of Medieval Manuscripts: A New Tool for Analysis and Mapping of Medieval Documents to Modern Orthography	JOURNAL OF UNIVERSAL COMPUTER SCIENCE			English	Article						MPEG spelling variations; mapping; phonetic algorithms	XML; SYSTEM	Medieval manuscripts or other written documents from that period contain valuable information about people, religion, and politics of the medieval period, making the study of medieval documents a necessary pre-requisite to gaining in-depth knowledge of medieval history. Although tool-less study of such documents is possible and has been ongoing for centuries, much subtle information remains locked such manuscripts unless it gets revealed by effective means of computational analysis. Automatic analysis of medieval manuscripts is a non-trivial task mainly due to non-conforming styles, spelling peculiarities, or lack of relational structures (hyper-links), which could be used to answer meaningful queries. Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools and algorithms are used to carry out computational analysis of text data. However due to high percentage of spelling variations in medieval manuscripts, NLP tools and algorithms cannot be applied directly for computational analysis. If the spelling variations are mapped to standard dictionary words, then application of standard NLP tools and algorithms becomes possible. In this paper we describe a web-based software tool CAMM (Computational Analysis of Medieval Manuscripts) that maps medieval spelling variations to a modern German dictionary. Here we describe the steps taken to acquire, reformat, and analyze data, produce putative mappings as well as the steps taken to evaluate the findings. At the time of the writing of this paper, CAMM provides access to 11275 manuscripts organized into 54 collections containing a total of 242446 distinctly spelled words. CAMM accurately corrects spelling of 55% percent of the verifiable words.

S	Palaia, R		Paglieri, F		Palaia, Roberto			Theories of consciousness in early-modern philosophy	CONSCIOUSNESS IN INTERACTION: THE ROLE OF THE NATURAL AND SOCIAL CONTEXT IN SHAPING CONSCIOUSNESS	Advances in Consciousness Research		English	Article; Book Chapter						consciousness; conscience; Bewusstsein; modern philosophy; philosophical dictionary		A semantic shift of the word consciousness (conscientia, conscience, Gewissen, Bewusstsein, coscienza) occurred in 17th- and 18th-century European languages. While in pre-modern times the term consciousness had been related to theology and ethics, in early modern thought, a new meaning was added to the term, somehow different from the original one. Early modern philosophers and scientists used consciousness to refer to the knowledge of Self. In addition, it is apparent that the syntagms relating to the word consciousness - as, for instance, freedom of consciousness, casus conscientiae - became more frequent in political, religious, scientific and philosophical texts. My contribution will analyse the occurrences of these semantic fields in some important philosphical and scientific texts and will examine their specific uses and contexts.

C	Subbotina, V		Chova, LG; Martinez, AL; Torres, IC		Subbotina, Victoria			PRAGMATIC ASPECT OF SOCIAL AND POLITICAL TEXTS	INTED2012: INTERNATIONAL TECHNOLOGY, EDUCATION AND DEVELOPMENT CONFERENCE	INTED Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	6th International Conference of Technology, Education and Development (INTED)	MAR 05-07, 2012	Valencia, SPAIN			pragmatic aspect; translation; source text; target text; analysis		Social and political text includes the following functions: communicative function, inducement function, criterion function and appealing function. According to this fact, there is a need to analyse pragmatic aspect of this type of texts. In our research pragmatic aspect is a complex of intralinguistic and interlinguistic specific features that influence the communicative act forming and the choice of language units. Therefore, the author of the target text should pay a special attention to the following text parameters: self-descriptiveness, communicative and pragmatic aspects and the style of the source text. Analysing translation of social and political texts it is necessary to mention that pragmatic aspect plays an important role in the translation process. For example, many famous translatologists focus their attention on the fact that the translator has to take into consideration not only denotative and connotative but also pragmatic components. Pragmatic component is defined by the interrelation between language expression and addressees of communication. These factors reflect the correspondence of interlinguistic reaction on information of the source text and target text addressees. Announcement of the source and target texts can be interpreted by readers and listeners in a different way. In this case it is necessary to establish a fact that translation as a bilingual communicative act does not achieve its aim. Analysing opinions of outstanding linguists the most important pragmatic aim means taking into consideration the difference in interpretation of one and the same text by representatives of various cultures, participants of different communicative situations. According to this fact the author observes the difference in background knowledge, concepts, interpretation and behavioral norms of addressees. The most important pragmatic problem is the necessity to overcome the differences in pragmatic aspects of the source and target texts. The author elaborated a diagram that gives us an opportunity to define the most important trends of the research. Analysing this phenomenon it is necessary to pay a special attention to language units and techniques, aim, stylistic peculiarities of social and political texts. These criteria form text pragmatics in general. Authors of social and political texts, having their social status, include their subjective judgments, evaluation, and opinions, which could form a text pragmatics in the newspaper article. This work is devoted to pragmatic aspects of translation process considering that translation of social and political texts is the key point of the research. Pragmatic aspects define translation of realias, objects or events which have a direct connection with the history, culture, national customs and traditions. In this case the translator has to pay a special attention to the words with no direct equivalents in other languages. For example, it can be lexical units that reflect specific realias of a definite country. Transliteration, transcription, loan translation, explicatory translation, translation comments are used for the translation of realias. Finally, analysing pragmatic aspects of social and political texts the author concludes that this issue is of a special interest for the contemporary research. It is necessary to point out that the most important function of social and political texts is appealing. According to this fact, the author of the source and target texts could use special language units in order to influence addressee's opinion and give rise to his/her corresponding response.

C	Subbotina, V		Chova, LG; Martinez, AL; Torres, IC		Subbotina, Victoria			GRAMMATICAL SPECIFIC FEATURES OF SOCIAL AND POLITICAL TEXTS	INTED2012: INTERNATIONAL TECHNOLOGY, EDUCATION AND DEVELOPMENT CONFERENCE	INTED Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	6th International Conference of Technology, Education and Development (INTED)	MAR 05-07, 2012	Valencia, SPAIN			grammar; translation; headlines; cross headings; source text; target text; syntactical structures		Social and political texts are characterized by different stylistic, lexical and syntactic peculiarities. Research of grammatical specific features of social and political texts is conducted on the basis of a wide language material. Social and political texts reflect events taking place at a definite period of time. Time intervals are different. The specialist can use categorial forms of non-continuous or continuous aspects characterized by contrasting unmarked and marked forms. It also depends on the descriptive situation. Duration and action are the basic characteristics of continuous aspect forms. The form of continuous aspect helps the specialist on social and political issues to describe some events at a definite moment in the Present Continuous or the Past Continuous Tenses in social and political texts. The author gives various examples and analyses the form of continuous aspect of the Present Continuous and the Past Continuous Tenses. The publication describes the fact that semantics of the Perfect form consists of the action indication of a definite period. Opposition Perfect - Non-Perfect gives the opportunity to describe an analysed event as a fact of a definite moment showing the chain of events in the framework of the context. It is known that the form of the verb in the Past Perfect Tense defines the priority of one action over the other. 53 social and political texts are the material for the research, 28 texts are in the English language and 25 texts are in the Russian language. The volume of each text is approximately 6000 printed characters. According to research conducted, the author has the following deduction: 1) social and political texts include approximately 24 % of passive forms; 2) this type of texts includes adjectives, adverbs and gerund, the total number is about 30 %; 3) the number of functioning modal verbs is about 16 %. 4) 33 sentences include the Future Simple Tense out of 200 and it is approximately 16.5 %. There is a good reason to consider some peculiarities of headlines translation of social and political texts. According to many famous linguists and translatologists, the difficulty of headline interpretation is that deviance of language norms is assumed in social and political texts (reduction of sentence structures; article, notional and linking verb omission, changes in syntactical structures, punctuation and word order specific features). The author analyses different examples of the English headlines and cross headings, however, it is important to note that cross headings usually decode information of the headlines. Headlines usually have a simple structure and cross headings are characterized by complex or compound sentence structures. Analysing social and political texts the author concludes that there are many headlines with the structures N+N, Adj.+N, N+Adj.: Deep Disappointment; Germany's nightmare; The Jamaica option; The Blood-red Revolution. Findings of the research help the author to conclude that it is necessary to analyse language specific features of social and political texts and try to define difficulties in the translation of this type of texts.

With rapid growth in online Social Networking Sites (SNS),there are numerous comments in web resources and it is difficult for people or government to know public opinion on the housing property tax. In this paper, using HowNet sentiment words we build a sentiment lexicon with the degree of emotional tendency by calculating word similarity. Based on the lexicon, we apply text mining technologies in online review analysis to obtain public sentiment orientation on the housing property tax and the evolution of positive and negative sentiments over time,which can guide policymakers to make decisions and guide public sentiment.

J	Kotze, E				Kotze, Ernst			Democratisation and Standardisation - conflicting objectives for indigenous languages?	TYDSKRIF VIR GEESTESWETENSKAPPE			Dutch	Review						standardisation; democratisation; language planning; indigenous languages; minority languages; restandardisation; sociolect; electronic corpora; selection; acceptance; codification; elaboration of functions; terminology; register		Democratisation and Standardisation - conflicting objectives for indigenous languages? At first blush, the two concepts, democratisation and standardisation, seem to be in conflict lithe objectives underlying the processes they describe are compared, in particular if they are applied to the field of language planning and politics, and especially within the context of the colonial history of Africa and further afield. It is in the nature of standardisation not to tolerate much variety, even in the language to be standardised (especially in the formal registers). The functional requirements of stylistic, sociolectal or geolectal variants in a language community, on the other hand, reflect a wide spectrum of varieties in a given language. Underlying the need for standardisation is the requirement for communication in the form of a unitary code (i.e. a language) which is understood and used by as many members of the community as possible, necessarily and usually in formal contexts. However, a standardised language, like all others, also has need of neutral and informal registers for which the appropriate vocabulary should be available. Such vocabulary originates in everyday speech, while "formal" terminology aimed at the higher functions of language is often compiled by bodies such as language commissions. The standardisation of language is often the result of a political process, which is a corollary of conquest, colonialism, or (sometimes) democratic change. A standard language, once established, normally possesses a self-perpetuating force - those who have acquired it, do not easily relinquish the concomitant social and political power associated with it. This applies in particular to non-mother-tongue speakers of the standard language, who benefit from the social status and increased access to knowledge associated with it. The result is, predictably, discrimination on the basis of proficiency in the standard, and societal imbalances. Arguments in defence of the selection of a non-indigenous standard are the purportedly equal distribution of disadvantage, as well as the possible unifying force of such a medium. To understand the task facing those who wish to standardise an indigenous language, the four phases traditionally identified by Haugen could be recalled, le. selection (macro and micro), codification, acceptance and cultivation (elaboration of functions). This is possibly another reason why already established colonial languages seemed to be an attractive choice at the outset when considering the adoption of an indigenous language for the purposes of standardisation. However, when the intellectual and economic benefits of linguistic democracy are considered, the investment in the enhancement of access to knowledge for entire language communities is well spent. The advantages for the development of human capital in the short and long term for such communities have been proven in countless scientific studies. A common disincentive is the purported "unsuitability" of indigenous languages for use in technical and scientific contexts. However, similar techniques for the creation of terminology are applied by all languages where elaboration of functions takes place, i.e. relexification, use of international cognates, conceptual translation (calquing), the use of informal vocabulary in specialised applications, neologisms, etcetera. Examples of attempts at standardisation or restandardisation of nonstandard varieties, such as in Norway and Albania can be adduced. In Norway, Nynorsk was created to replace Bokmal, but there was a clear differentiation by the speakers between spoken and written requirements, so that the written language gravitated to Bokmal, and the spoken language to Nynorsk. In Albania, where Standard Albanian was based on Tosc, attempts were made at incorporating elements of North Albanian (Gegh) into the standard for reasons of 'justice". However, it foundered as a result of resistance from intellectuals on the basis that "justice" in standardisation was "impossible". Some lessons from Norway, and also the Magreb (which is subsequently discussed), are that varieties in both Norwegian and Arabic are closely linked to rules of contextuality and register; and that, although there is a greater need for uniformity as regards the form of written standard, the written form of informally used items needs to be standardised as well, albeit in a different way Finally, the use of the Internet as agent for both standardisation and democratisation is briefly investigated. It is apparent that informal standardisation (through codification) is taking place through the production of increased volumes of texts by common users. The production of electronic texts leads to the compilation of corpora, and standardisation of the lexicon takes place on the basis of frequency counts and the use of concordances by NGO's. Some examples of such standardisation (official and unofficial) in Africa are provided. The conclusions drawn from the overview are that: (a) Democratisation and standardisation do not have to represent conflicting objectives for indigenous languages in Africa; (b) Users of language determine the form that is standardised in the end; and (c) Speakers of African languages have the ability to determine not only which language(s) they prefer to use for which purpose, but also the form of such languages.

Coreference resolution: A review of general methodologies and applications in the clinical domain	JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL INFORMATICS			English	Review						NLP; Coreference; EHR	EXTRACTION SYSTEM; INFORMATION	Coreference resolution is the task of determining linguistic expressions that refer to the same real-world entity in natural language. Research on coreference resolution in the general English domain dates back to 1960s and 1970s. However, research on coreference resolution in the clinical free text has not seen major development. The recent US government initiatives that promote the use of electronic health records (EHRs) provide opportunities to mine patient notes as more and more health care institutions adopt EHR. Our goal was to review recent advances in general purpose coreference resolution to lay the foundation for methodologies in the clinical domain, facilitated by the availability of a shared lexical resource of gold standard coreference annotations, the Ontology Development and Information Extraction (ODIE) corpus.

J	Al Ali, G				Al Ali, Ghayda			Hero or terrorist? A comparative analysis of Arabic and Western media depictions of the execution of Saddam	DISCOURSE & COMMUNICATION			English	Article						Arab power discourse; Arabic news text; Arabic newspaper discourse; critical discourse analysis; cross-cultural communication; English-Arabic discourse		While the role of the media in the war against terror has received ample attention from scholars, there is little in the literature that deals specifically with the Iraqi point of view with respect to the nature of terror or with the comparative analysis of Western and Arabic media treatment of terror. That Western and Arabic ideologies arise from divergent political, national, cultural, and religious traditions is well understood in the West. Indeed, this understanding is generally implicit and unconscious, often leading to perception of Arabic culture and ideology as a monolithic whole. Lost in this division between 'Us' and 'Other' are the multitude of inner-Arabic ideological divisions. Among these is an important inner-Arabic ideological division that reflects the larger Arab-Western ideological split, a split between those in support of Saddam's reign and the post-invasion Iraqi insurgency and those in opposition. Cultural ideologies, all-encompassing yet often unstated, are difficult to summarize and analyze through the examination of indigenous news media. The media must balance truthful accuracy and objectivity with self-preservation. They must be exceedingly sensitive to the moods and outlooks of their target audiences in order to survive politically as well as economically. This work is a comparative, descriptive analysis of Saddam's execution as covered by Arab and Western media, making use of Van Dijk's Socio-ideological Discourse Theory as embodied in the Theories of Semantic Macroproposition and the concept of the Ideological Square as well as the Discourse-Historical Approach of Wodak. This combination of theoretical elements constitutes a basis for comparative Arabic-English discourse analysis with a focus on socio-linguistic analysis of text and rhetoric, rather than the more common functional Systemic Linguistic analysis or grammar theory considerations. These analytical elements also enable the de-construction of news media coverage in terms of macro-microstructures, micro-semantics, and the rhetoric news discourse. Technical analysis of news article word count, lexical selection, grammar, literary style, and rhetoric provides a portal through which hidden opinion, ideology, and dogma are made visible.

It examines the translation-relevant items have and be when used as main verbs and their German translation solutions, drawing on a theoretical and methodological framework that takes due account of the context, i.e., the domain(s) underlying the text and reflected in it, and the situation in which the translations fulfill their communicative function in expert-to-expert communication. The data analyzed come from the scientific and technical translation part of the Cologne Specialized Translation Corpus, a high-quality translation corpus designed for translational research. The analysis reveals trends in translation solutions that can be of relevance in translation teaching, professional translation and translation quality assessment. The findings suggest that analyzing register shifts requires translation research to engage with the context, to take account of all textual and extra-textual aspects that trigger specific uses of language in a particular translation. The paper concludes with a call for greater emphasis on the quality of the translation product in corpus compilation, so that researchers may obtain more reliable results and a better understanding of the constrained nature of scientific and technical translation.

As more and more people make their opinions available on the Internet and as people increasingly consult the Internet to ascertain other people's opinions about products, political issues, and so on, the demand for effective subjectivity analysis systems continues to grow. Information extraction systems, which automatically identify and extract factual information relating to events of interest, remain critically important in this day and age of increasingly vast amounts of text available online. In this work, we discover that these research areas are mutually beneficial. Information extraction techniques may be used to learn informative clues of subjectivity. Then, by bootstrapping from a lexicon of subjectivity clues, we can build a subjective-objective sentence classifier that does not require annotated data as input. This classifier may then be used to improve information extraction performance, on data which have not been annotated for subjectivity, by improving precision.

J	O'Grady, G				O'Grady, Gerard			The unfolded imagining of Segolene Royal	JOURNAL OF PRAGMATICS			English	Article						Systemic functional linguistics; Media bias; Gender	NEWS COVERAGE; CAMPAIGN; GENDER	This paper investigates how two British newspapers, the Guardian and the Telegraph, construed the French Socialist Presidential candidate, Segolene Royal. It explores how both newspapers employed lexicogrammatical choices to realize texts, which represented Royal as an inhabitant of worlds normally dissociated from politics. It shows that both newspapers through their choices of material and relational processes consistently represented her not only as an actor in a political world but also simultaneously represented her as an actor in a celebrity world and to a lesser extent as an actor in the private sphere of the family. By depicting her as a celebrity, the newspapers distanced her not only from ordinary life but also denigrated her gravitas as a politician. The article also examines the newspapers' use of over-lexicalization in depicting Royal as subject in nominal groups and shows that both newspapers had difficulty in situating Royal, a 53-year-old unmarried mother of four, as a political figure. Finally, by examining intrusions into the texts, it shows how a metaphor 'old is bad' was evoked and used to deflect serious discussion of Royal's policies and views. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

These letters, currently kept at the State Archives of Florence, are Italian translations of original Turkish or Arabic texts, which were made in loco by Sephardic merchants and brokers who traded in the Mediterranean and occasionally served as interpreters. The analysis of the main orthographic, phonetic, morpho-syntactic, and lexical features of the letters shows the existence of a wide net of Jewish traders/interpreters sharing similar linguistic uses.										149	6	6	0	4	SOC ED IL MULINO	BOLOGNA	STRADA MAGGIORE 37, 40125 BOLOGNA, ITALY	0024-385X			LINGUA STILE	Ling.

J	Govind, R				Govind, Rahul			Revenue, rent ... profit? Early British imperialism(1), political economy and the search for a differentia specifica (inter se)	INDIAN ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL HISTORY REVIEW			English	Article						British imperialism; political economy; colonialism; enlightenment; modernity		This article argues that in the mid to late eighteenth century, political economy, through writers such as Francois Quesnay, David Hume and Adam Smith, saw a discussion of 'despotism', which stood for thinking through the political arrangement within which economic productivity was formulated; even as the distinction between the two was not always self-evident. This theoretical function of despotism disappears in the 'mature' phase of political economy (David Ricardo), precisely when it was taking shape-in institutional and conceptual-lexical terms-in the subcontinent through Britain's conquest of India via the East India Company. We argue that the disappearance of despotism at the conceptual level in this phase in Britain is not only questionable from a theoretical standpoint but also played its historical role as a decoy in occluding attention toward imperialism in India wherein the distinction between the political and the economic was becoming more and more difficult to make. Through such an investigation we thus hope to examine the emergence of the economy (and by implication the state-political) as an independent analytic site as well as evaluate its categories and historical significance. We base our argument on a reading of the canonical texts of figures such as Adam Smith, William Blackstone and David Ricardo, Land Revenue Settlement sources in India and the hitherto neglected economic writings of W.H. Sleeman.

However, such methods have not been widely used in other disciplines. With the aim of disseminating these approaches, we introduce a text-analytic technique (Contrast Analysis of Semantic Similarity, CASS, www.casstools.org), based on the BEAGLE semantic space model (Jones & Mewhort, Psychological Review, 114, 1-37, 2007) and add new features to test between-corpora differences in semantic associations (e.g., the association between democrat and good, compared to democrat and bad). By analyzing television transcripts from cable news from a 12-month period, we reveal significant differences in political bias between television channels (liberal to conservative: MSNBC, CNN, FoxNews) and find expected differences between newscasters (Colmes, Hannity). Compared to existing measures of media bias, our measure has higher reliability. CASS can be used to investigate semantic structure when exploring any topic (e.g., self-esteem or stereotyping) that affords a large text-based database.

WORLD CONFERENCE ON EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY RESEARCHES-2011	Procedia Social and Behavioral Sciences		English	Proceedings Paper	World Conference on Educational Technology Researches (WCETR)	JUL 05-09, 2011	East Univ, Nicosia, CYPRUS	Gazi Univ, Cyprus Educ Sci Assoc	East Univ	Traditional; Translation; Teaching; Basics; Tools		This paper puts focus on the traditional teaching tools. In order to find their answers the authors conducted a course of advanced translation using the traditional blackboard where students were only allowed to use paper dictionaries and conducted the same course in another class where data projectors and PowerPoint slides were used and students were allowed to bring all sorts of electronic devises and tools to the class including laptop and digital dictionaries. At the end of both courses students sat a test in order to see which method has been more successful. Students were also given a questionnaire to see which method is more appealing to them and motivates them more. Translation is one of the major contributing factors in the development of science and technology especially in non-English speaking countries. The reason is that an understanding of the flood of the new science and technology in these countries is gained mostly through translated texts. It is an open secret that providing translators who are the link between the world's science and technology and the university students with a teaching approach capable of capable of stimulating their internal talents and motivations is of prime importance. A major part of the teaching approach is the facilities used in the process of teaching. Today teachers have lots of new technologies, electronic instructional and communicational technologies at hand that are deemed as basis for institutional reforms and powerful agents for the development of new teaching strategies and material. Moreover, nowadays lots of pedagogues, psychologists, teachers and politicians are worried about the level of knowledge of the young people and wonder if they can keep up their steps with the development of science and technology.

C	Gangutia, E		GarciaBellido, MP; Callegarin, L; Diaz, AJ		Gangutia, Elvira			BARTER, MONEY AND PAYMENT IN ARCHAIC GREEK LEXICON	BARTER, MONEY AND COINAGE IN THE ANCIENT MEDITERRANEAN (10TH-1ST CENTURIES BC)	Anejos de Archivo Espanol de Arqueologia		English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Her Majesty The Queen of Spain	MAR 15-17, 2010	Spains Council Sci Res, Madrid, SPAIN		Spains Council Sci Res	7th-6th century BC; Homer; Hesiod; Money; Coinage; Solon's Law; Stater; pi rho i alpha tau o; chi rho eta mu alpha tau alpha		It is only in certain texts of poets from the 7th-6th century BC where we find words in Greek which would mean money, much less coinage. In Homer, we find clusters of terms, proceeding from an archaic, even Mycenaean world, and from different semantic fields, which due to material changes, social trends and linguistic dynamics, generally came to mean barter and money. There are excellent studies that attempt to define an inventory of the several ways of expressing acquisition or exchange in Homer. But let us take into consideration a kernel one, buying, expressed in several ways from which we select he bought, whose only object is either women or children, attested with the same sense and specification (women and subdivided children) since Mycenaean times (qi-ri-jato). Laertes (Od.1.430-1) bought (Eurycleia when she was in her first youth) with his own possessions and gave for her the value of twenty cattle. We have here a superposition of standards for barter : bovine cattle and the more general term This last word appears in Homer only as an (instrumental) dative and may accompany the act of acquisition with no other specification, not only expressed by. The form, together with others, which mean different forms of possession proceeds from a root only attested in Greek and Indo-Iranian. There are in Homer many lists of items used for exchange and payment. The games in honour of dead Patroclus afford an extraordinary inventory (II. 23.259 ff.) of valuables offered (almost as in an auction) to the heroes, who do not contend only for prestige but also (v. 709) for. The contests are carefully ranked, the most prestigious being chariot races (contest I), and the trophies are equivalent to this ranking. Other details are added to many of them: measures and weights; equivalence in bovine heads of cattle; their origin, mostly from plundering, and even their history. The situation of gold in this text is quite surprising, appearing only in low positions: the weight of two talents of gold are offered for the fourth place in contest I, and half a talent for the third place in contest III (palaestra). In the lower part of this table, iron is offered: for contest VI (shot put of discus throwing) a rare piece of iron is exhibited: it belongs to Achilles's (cauldron, tripods, horses, mules, cows, women, iron) kept securely off shore in boats and disembarked just for the Games. For contest VII (arch) the trophy consists of iron axes: (v. 850) ten and ten. As in Homer are still only spits used for roasting, the twenty axes and their proportional relation suggest a pre-monetal use. The cluster of words of root, alternates with that formed by and, related in Homer not to "life" but mostly to "means of life" based on agrarian and cattle supplies. The most important and universal is, frequently joined to. Bio-roc may be the minimal sustenance for all people, poor and rich; it is attached to house or palace; it is what Phoenician merchants get in exchange for their goods and take in their boats (0d.15.446, 456). It may alternate with i".avov when meaning "gain", "earning" . But both in Od.2.123, or sometimes Odysseus' possessions might be substituted (v. 205) by an almost isolated newcomer, attested only in the Odyssey: it is, used also to name the presents embarked for Odysseus by the Phaeacians on his journey home, comprising the usual tripods, cauldrons, gold, but now including also clothes. It may not be enough for using a different word, but its future as barter was to displace almost completely what we have seen until now. The extraordinary diversity of goods in Homer is substantially cut down in Hesiod: gold and silver are not in the hands of men, but in those of the gods; on the other hand there is plenty of iron, with no need to import it: Hesiod knows its mining well and its favourable and also terrible effects. The great herds of cattle and horses of the Homeric heroes are no more or exist only in myth. Just an ox and a horse are needed for the cultivation of a Hesiodean plot in a subsistence economy. Consequently the 12T- system is disappearing: appears only once in each of the great poems Theogonia and Opera, always with the adjective "alien" and (36o; seem to maintain an almost pre -Homeric meaning of food supplies, especially cereal kept in granaries, practically the only riches kept jealously by the Hesiodic peasant. The poet advises how to keep PLOc, the minimal unit of possession and survival (0p.601) inside the house, and to prevent robbers (0d.320.605) from stealing them, also called a word that also means the implements for cultivation (0p.407). Hesiod is an inland man; he does not like the sea or sailing. But thanks to the disastrous sailing and commercial experience of his father and through the knowledge provided by oral epics, he feels confident in advising about the sailing seasons or how to handle the exported in the merchant boat (the bigger the boat, the better for . In spite of the apparent meekness of Hesiodic life, he is conscious that he is at the end of the Dark Ages and at the start of an enrichment trend which is expressed in the identification of with the lexicon of "life" (Op. 686). has advanced enormously to displace the systems to become an almost "universal" word. Moreover, we find in Hesiod the singular zp-71..tcx, one of its meanings being "thing", a word non-existent in Homer. More or less the same landscape as in Hesiod may be found in the earliest lyric poets, where also the plural meaning things is found (Archilochus 206a.1, 220, 7th century BC). The change arrives in authors and inscriptions of 7th -6th century BC, when the phenomenon of coinage starts to be reflected in the lexicon. Alcaeus from Lesbos, an island with great dependence on Lydia (Fr.69, cf. 63.7) says that as a sort of political donation It would be the oldest mention of "stater" (but there is myc. ta-te-re). Also, in his Fr. 382.2, for the first time the word vd.., trr..tcx is written. It has been understood in many ways, as "norm, custom, order, legality", etc. but we think that it means "coined money", understanding the two verses as an irony addressed to a prostitute, who is able "to gather an army"... "looking at" or "considering money"; Alcaeus is also the first who uses the word , even when referring to a . It is interesting that Hipponax Ephesius (7th century BC), also from the Asiatic colonies, "demands sixty stateras". The earliest absolute mention of 8pcxxlrtj (but surely a "handful of is meant) would be in an inscription of 7th -6th century BC. in Perachora (not far from Corinth). But authors of the 6th 5th centuries BC, such as Hipponax, mostly live in a world in which coined money is currently attested (as a Lydian invention in Xenophanes B4, (Eretria, 6th century BC).

They try to take account of the complexity of public views in order to design populist measures and increase dramatically their consensus. The Web sources are more accessible, ubiquitous, and valuable than ever before. But the most valuable information is often hidden and encoded in blog posts or pages, which are often neither structured, nor classified, being free textual. The process of accessing all these raw data, heterogeneous in terms of source and lexicon, and transforming them into information is therefore strongly linked to automatic textual analysis and conceptual synthesis. This paper describes a Sentiment Mining study performed on over 1,000 news articles or forum/blog posts, concerning the Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, involved in the escorts' scandal.

This can be realized through the definition and implementation of a formal ontological language that provides the concept definition models (dictionary-taxonomy) and language structure, and in which knowledge, requirements as well as product and process information can be expressed. This paper describes such a formal ontological language, called Gellish (a further development of ISO 10303-221 and ISO 15926), and its implementation in a universal database and message structure and it describes how that language is extended with a capability for the modeling of textual requirements.

J	Li, JA				Li, Juan			Transitivity and lexical cohesion: Press representations of a political disaster and its actors	JOURNAL OF PRAGMATICS			English	Article						Transitivity; Lexical cohesion; News; Ideology; Critical discourse analysis; Systemic functional grammar		Using The New York Times' and China Daily's reports of the NATO bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Yugoslavia in May 1999 as examples, this article aims to unravel the processes of representing the event and its social actors in news texts. The article focuses on investigating the relations between choices of certain linguistic forms and the ideologies and power relations which underlie such forms. Guided by assumptions of critical discourse analysis and drawing on the analytical framework offered in Michael Halliday's Systemic Functional Grammar, the article examines two dimensions of clause grammar: transitivity and lexical cohesion, which may be respectively associated with the ideational and textual functions of language. By analyzing aspects of clause grammar related to these two dimensions of language in news texts of different ideological orientations, the article shows that interpretations of the NATO bombing and of the roles of social actors involved in the bombing event are constructed in the specific choices that each newspaper makes in the two dimensions of text organization.

Interpretations which stress the Diary's textual rendering of a private self most notably neglect Pepys's keen sense of playing an active part in the social and political changes which swept England in the middle of the seventeenth century. Drawing on a range of contextual material, both literary and historical, the present reading locates the Diary in the context of early modern administrative professionalisation. It proposes that we read the Diary in relation to Pepys's emerging sense of public duty as well as to his 'business' and professional 'sobriety' as a civil servant. 'Sobriety' and 'business', this article suggests, were part of a post-Interregnum 'cultural lexicon' ( in Quentin Skinner's sense) which allowed a new generation of professionalised civil servants to articulate their distinct contribution to the 'business of the Kingdom'. The two terms converge on the notion of a 'public' self which fundamentally shapes the Diary's much-discussed rhetoric of privacy.

J	Esch, J				Esch, Joanne			Legitimizing the "War on Terror": Political Myth in Official-Level Rhetoric	POLITICAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						Political myth; Rhetoric; Legitimization; Narrative stories; War on Terror		This paper argues that mythical discourse affects political practice by imbuing language with power, shaping what people consider to be legitimate, and driving the determination to act. Drawing on Bottici's (2007) philosophical understanding of political myth as a process of work on a common narrative that answers the human need to ground events in significance, it contributes to the study of legitimization in political discourse by examining the role of political myth in official-level U.S. war rhetoric. It explores how two ubiquitous yet largely invisible political myths, American Exceptionalism and Civilization vs. Barbarism, which have long defined America's ideal image of itself and its place in the world, have become staples in the language of the "War on Terror." Through a qualitative analysis of the content of over 50 official texts containing lexical triggers of the two myths, this paper shows that senior officials of the Bush Administration have rhetorically accessed these mythical representations of the world in ways that legitimize and normalize the practices of the "War on Terror.".

J	Cornelius, E				Cornelius, Eleanor			Plain language as alternative textualisation	SOUTHERN AFRICAN LINGUISTICS AND APPLIED LANGUAGE STUDIES			English	Article							SIMPLIFICATION	Plain language is a form of intra-lingual translation, a process during which particular interventions are brought to bear on a complex text, such as an act, in order to fit the linguistic competence of a particular target audience (Bhatia, 1983; 1993). In this way, complicated content is unlocked and meaning mediated. The aim is to cut down on the cognitive processing difficulties experienced by the reader. Careful consideration must therefore be given to the linguistic features used in this alternative text. In South Africa, plain language received its first exposure during the 1990s, in a particular political context in which a human rights culture took centre stage. It is important, in a democracy, to inform ordinary citizens of their basic rights, and to do so in understandable language. In this study, a lexico-grammatical analysis is undertaken of a booklet, Equality for All, which is based on an act of parliament. Following a text-based approach, the linguistic features are measured against the principles of plain language, specifically focusing on the grammatical constructions and lexical items that have been proven to obscure meaning and impede understanding. The principal aim of this article is to assess whether the language employed in this simplified text is accessible to non-mother tongue speakers with no formal training in, and limited knowledge of, the law.

J	Lee, DB				Lee, Dong-bae			Portrayals of Non-North Koreans in North Korean Textbooks and the Formation of National Identity	ASIAN STUDIES REVIEW			English	Article						North Korea; nationalism; identity formation; Kim Jeong-il; textbooks; personality cult; non-North Koreans		This article examines the portrayal of non-North Koreans in North Korean textbooks to assess the influences on the formation of North Korean identity, and how such identity formation is important in Kim Jeong-il's retention of power. This study not only looks closely at textual representations; it also examines how political and ideological changes in North Korea had a critical influence on these texts. The study encompasses both lexico-grammatical analysis and the analysis of textual and visual images, based on an examination of six North Korean language textbooks published from 1954 to 2000. It demonstrates that North Korean identity is defined through the portrayal of non-North Koreans, particularly enemy others. The portrayal of non-North Koreans facilitates the formation of a solid North Korean identity - an identity that entails serving their political leaders, remaining vigilant against threats to their country, and liberating South Koreans from poverty and oppression by America and its puppet states.

The corpus covers a wide range of text genres including books, magazines, newspapers, governmental white papers, textbooks, minutes of the National Diet, internet text (bulletin board and blogs) and so forth, and when possible, samples are drawn from the rigidly defined statistical populations by means of random sampling. All texts are dually POS-analyzed based upon two different, but mutually related, definitions of 'word.' Currently, more than 90 million words have been sampled and XML annotated with respect to text-structure and lexical and character information. A preliminary linear discriminant analysis of text genres using the data of POS frequencies and sentence length revealed it was possible to classify the text genres with a correct identification rate of 88% as far as the samples of books, newspapers, whitepapers, and internet bulletin boards are concerned. When the samples of blogs were included in this data set, however, the identification rate went down to 68%, suggesting the considerable variance of the blog texts in terms of the textual register and style.

J	Mikolic, V; Begus, A				Mikolic, Vesna; Begus, Ana			IDENTIFYING TERMS FOR A DICTIONARY OF TOURIST TERMS	ANNALES-ANALI ZA ISTRSKE IN MEDITERANSKE STUDIJE-SERIES HISTORIA ET SOCIOLOGIA			Slovene	Article						tourism; terminology; dictionary of terms; candidate term; specialised corpus; field-specific texts; functional typology; dictionary article		Dictionaries of terms are characteristic of highly developed expert fields and enable linguistically appropriate expert communication, they suggest Slovene terms for new subjects and terms within quickly developing or new expert fields, reflect the spirit and culture of a nation Of they are based upon local material!) as well as political tendencies (Humar, 2004, 23). At the same time the multilingual terminological dictionaries enable international communication within new social and political circumstances. At this point, surely, the way a terminological dictionary is conceived and formed, should be put into considertion. Logar (2009, 321) refers to three phases in the creation of a dictionary of terms, namely: determining the texts suitable for term acquisition; defining the standards for including words into the dictionary; defining information included within a dictionary article. The aim of the present paper is to show the theoretical definitions and practical solutions important for all three phases of the developing dictionary of tourist terms with an emphasis on term identification. Editing a dictionary of tourist terms was based on corpus approach. Firstly, the paper focuses on selection and classification of texts for the TURK corpus of tourist texts, which currently includes approximately 30 million words. The corpus was used as a basis for an automatically generated list of words (monograms) and phrases (bigrams and trigrams) arranged from most to least frequent. The further procedure of selecting tourist terms was performed on the basis of preliminary sorting of tourist texts in the Corpus according to the type of tourism and the included social sphere. It was precisely the social sphere, which is expressed in the dictionary article as a qualificator of an individual term, that has proven to be the most relevant when making a selection of tourist terms.

The Web is a huge virtual space where to express individual opinions and influence any aspect of life. Internet contains a wealth of data that can be mined to detect valuable opinions, with implications even in the political arena. Nowadays the Web sources are more accessible and valuable than ever before, but most of the times the true valuable information is hidden in thousands of textual pages. Their transformation into information is therefore strongly linked to their automatic lexical analysis and semantic synthesis. This poster describes a Knowledge Mining study performed on over 1000 news articles or posts in forum/blogs, concerning the Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, involved last year in the sexual scandal. All these textual contributions have been Morpho-Syntactically analysed, Semantically Role labelled and Clustered in order to find meaniful similarities, hilite possible hidden relationships and evaluate their sentiment polarity.

J	Neves, LMBP				Neves, Lucia Maria Bastos P.			Independence: Contexts and concepts	HISTORIA UNISINOS			Portuguese	Article						independence; separatism; history of concepts; liberalism		During the first decades of the 19(th) century the term Independence acquired particular and diverse connotations in the Iberian-American world, becoming what Koselleck calls a concept. It was not just an idea exclusively related to the Americas which, through their revolutions, legitimated the emancipation of the new nations as a result of the arrival of liberal ideas. The proposal of this text is precisely to analyze the contexts and meanings that the concept of Independence acquired in the Iberian-American world in that period, taking the Brazilian Independence as the central point of reference, but looking for links with Hispanic America. Through the analysis of dictionaries, History books and circumstantial literature - political flyers and journals - the author identifies the different languages that the elites as well as their contemporaries used in order to express the different political and social identities present in that historical situation, making a new reading of such processes of Independence possible.

In order to facilitate sensitive and expressive communication in such environments, we introduced a novel syntactic rule-based approach to affect recognition from text. Our Affect Analysis Model follows the compositionality principle, according to which emotional meaning of a sentence is determined by composing parts that correspond to lexical units or other linguistic constituent types governed by the rules of aggregation, propagation, domination, neutralization, and intensification, at various grammatical levels. The proposed rule-based approach processes each sentence in sequential stages, including symbolic cue processing, detection and transformation of abbreviations, sentence parsing, and word/phrase/sentence-level analyses. Our method is capable of processing sentences of different complexity, including simple, compound, complex (with complement and relative clauses), and complex-compound sentences. Affect in text is classified into nine emotion categories (or neutral), and, additionally, information that indicates social communicative behaviour is identified. The evaluation of the Affect Analysis Model algorithm showed promising results regarding its capability to accurately recognize affective information in text from an existing corpus of informal online conversations. The applications of the developed Affect Analysis Model in Instant Messaging system (AffectIM) and in Second Life (EmoHeart, iFeel_IM!) are described in the chapter.

Sentiment lexicons are basic resources for investigating the orientation of a text that can be performed considering polarized words included in it but they encode the polarity of word types instead that the polarity of word tokens. The expression of an opinion through the choice of lexical items is context-sensitive and sentiment lexicons can be integrated with syntagmatic patterns that emerge as significant with statistical analyses. In this paper it will be proposed a corpus analysis of adverbially modified ambiguous (e.g. fast, rich) and objective adjectives (e.g. chemical, political) - that can be occasionally exploited to express a subjective judgments -. Comparing polarity encoded in sentiment lexicons and the results of a logistic regression analysis, the role of adverbial cues for polarity detection will be evaluated on the basis of a small sample of sentences manually annotated.

Multinational companies have implemented Western European and American communicative practices and pattern. Thus, new communicative patterns have emerged in professional Romanian. In this paper we present part of the results of a larger on-going research project, 'Professional Language in Present-day Romanian. Linguistic Patterns and Discursive Structures', which is supported by a governmental, grant (CNCSIS, ID 142). Within the frameworks of sociolinguistics and discourse analysis, we will focus on three aspects that cover various linguistic compartments: new textual patterns, lexico-semantic innovations, and salutation formulas. The data for this paper have been selected from the corpus 'Workplace communication. Tentative typology of Romanian professional written texts'. The corpus contains 126 texts, which were written in various fields of activity (commercial, production, administrative, educational, military, and medical). In this paper, we argue and exemplify the ways in which various discursive structures have been adapted to the Romanian specificities of intra-organizational communication, and we lay special emphasis on the reorganization of the lexical level as a result of the influence of English on Romanian as well as on the alterations brought about by the familiar 'you' and first name address in salutation formulas.

This content is a virtual gold-mine of information that can inform a range of social, governmental, and business decisions. For example, using content available on blogs and social networking sites businesses can find out what its customers are saying about their products and services. In the digital age where customer is king, the business value of ascertaining consumer sentiment cannot be overstated. People express sentiments in myriad ways. At times, they use simple, direct assertions, but most often they use sentences involving comparisons, conjunctions expressing multiple and possibly opposing sentiments about multiple features and entities, and pronominal references whose resolution requires discourse level context. Frequently people use abbreviations, slang, SMSese, idioms and metaphors. Understanding the latter also requires common sense reasoning. In this paper, we present iSEE, a fully implemented sentiment extraction engine, which makes use of statistical methods, classical NLU techniques, common sense reasoning, and probabilistic inference to extract entity and feature specific sentiment from complex sentences and dialog. Most of the components of iSEE are domain independent and the system can be generalized to new domains by simply adding domain relevant lexicons.

J	Voolaid, P				Voolaid, Piret			HUMOROUS INTERPRETATIONS OF ABBREVIATIONS AS A SOCIO-CULTURAL PHENOMENON	FOLKLORE-ELECTRONIC JOURNAL OF FOLKLORE			English	Article						abbreviations; abbreviation parodies; abbreviation riddles; acronyms; folk humour; group lore; quasi-acronyms; slang	ACRONYMS	The article discusses the nature of abbreviation jokes, the possible formulation principles, relations to humour and slang and the way their interpretation depends on the socio-cultural context. The abbreviated riddle corpus, (ca 3,000 texts of about 330 types) stored in the Folklore Archives of the Estonian Literary Museum, constitutes the source material for the study. The material has been systematised and presented in the database Eesti luhendmoistatused or Estonian Abbreviation Riddles (Voolaid 2004). The database provides a fine overview of alternative folkloric interpretations of abbreviations and acronyms in different periods and allows us to diachronically observe and describe the transformation of the genre in the socio-cultural context. The article introduces the possible ways of systematisation and formulation principles of the alternative interpretations of Estonian abbreviations (abbreviation parodies) bordering folklore and language. Folklorists have approached the phenomenon as a subgenre of riddles: the question part consists of a conventional abbreviation, whereas the explanation provided in the answer part is radically different from the conventional one; it is witty and humorous, often with a political or sexual undertone. A single abbreviation may produce several alternative interpretations, including the conventional and the folkloric explanation. Alternative (often witty) interpretation of abbreviations can be considered an important source of the slang lexicon of group languages (e.g., exclusive subcultures, professional parlance) or secret language.(1)				piret@folklore.ee	Voolaid, Piret/AAB-1444-2020					26	3	3	0	0	ESTONIAN LITERARY MUSEUM	TARTU	FOLK BELIEF & MEDIA GRP, VANEMUISE 42-235, TARTU, 51003, ESTONIA	1406-0957			FOLKLORE-EL J FOLKL	Folklore-Electron.

J	Toso, F				Toso, Fiorenzo			New backdatings from texts of the revolutionary period (1797-1806)	LINGUA E STILE			French	Article						Linguistic backdatings; French loanwords		Given both the importance of the type of government of the democratic Ligurian Republic and the long duration of the Imperial administration of the Genovesato (1805-1814), the texts produced in those contexts offer a particularly fertile terrain for investigation of the "lexicon of the revolutionaries", and, more generally, of the lexis introduced in the period between the end of the eighteenth century and the beginning of the nineteenth century. The publication of this paper is a useful contribution (albeit partial and provisional, as are all endeavours of this nature) to the collective task of establishing the period in which Italian lexical items and expressions entered the language and became more widespread. However, it also shows that although certain lines of investigation might seem to have been dealt with exhaustively, they still provide important material for the study of historical linguistics.										9	0	0	0	0	SOC ED IL MULINO	BOLOGNA	STRADA MAGGIORE 37, 40125 BOLOGNA, ITALY	0024-385X			LINGUA STILE	Ling.

Psychoanalysis and Its Publishing House Strategies	BERICHTE ZUR WISSENSCHAFTSGESCHICHTE			German	Article						archive; authorization; epistemology; Freud; media; monopolization; naming politics; propaganda; psychoanalysis; visualisation		Towards the Files. Psychoanalysis and Its Publishing House Strategies. The following case study deals with the Internationaler Psychoanalytischer Verlag, founded 1919 in Vienna by a group around Sigmund Freud and shut down in 1938 by the Gestapo. During that time the Verlag published the titles of the contemporary psychoanalytic movement, including the first pychoanalytic dictionary, the Almanach as a yearbook, the four authoritative journals, as well as the first complete edition of Freud's writings. A single publishing house became thus responsible for the appearance of an entire theory - a unique situation without historical comparison. My thesis here is that the Verlag initiated certain strategies of publicising (e.g. centralising the movement, enforcing the company's name, labelling its activities) that were, prior to arguments and contents, constitutive for development of psychoanalysis as well as its implementation within the field of science. Consequently, these strategies cannot be found through interpretations of psychoanalytical texts, but in the genuine files and in view of the material products (books, journals, blurbs, advertisements etc.) that were passed down from the Verlag. As an opening step, this essay explores several of those Viennese files, showing that the Verlag not only struggled with monetary and personal problems but rather and foremost launched branding, marketing and public relation campaigns as key concepts to make sciences and its articular knowledge acceptable. As a result the Verlag changed from a commercial and distributive institution to an epistemic medium.

J	Rosenberg, A; Hirschberg, J				Rosenberg, Andrew; Hirschberg, Julia			Charisma perception from text and speech	SPEECH COMMUNICATION			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Seminar on Research Challenges in Speech Technology	OCT, 2005	Stockholm, SWEDEN	KTH, Dept Speech, Music & Hearing, Ctr Speech Technol		Charismatic speech; Paralinguistic analysis; Political speech		Charisma, the ability to attract and retain followers without benefit of formal authority, is more difficult to define than to identify. While we each seem able to identify charismatic individuals - and non-charismatic individuals - it is not clear what it is about an individual that influences our judgment. This paper describes the results of experiments designed to discover potential correlates of such judgments, in what speakers say and the way that they say it. We present results of two parallel experiments in which subjective judgments of charisma in spoken and in transcribed American political speech were analyzed with respect to the acoustic and prosodic (where applicable) and lexico-syntactic characteristics of the speech being assessed. While we find that there is considerable disagreement among subjects on how the speakers of each token are ranked, we also find that subjects appear to share a functional definition of charisma, in terms of other personal characteristics we asked them to rank speakers by. We also find certain acoustic, prosodic, and lexico-syntactic characteristics that correlate significantly with perceptions of charisma. Finally, by comparing the responses to spoken vs. transcribed stimuli, we attempt to distinguish between the contributions of "what is said" and "how it is said" with respect to charisma judgments.

J	Zitouni, I; Sarikaya, R				Zitouni, Imed; Sarikaya, Ruhi			Arabic diacritic restoration approach based on maximum entropy models	COMPUTER SPEECH AND LANGUAGE			English	Article						Arabic diacritic restoration; Vowelization; Maximum entropy; Finite state transducer		In modern standard Arabic and in dialectal Arabic texts, short vowels and other diacritics are omitted. Exceptions are made for important political and religious texts and in scripts for beginning students of Arabic. Scripts without diacritics have considerable ambiguity because many words with different diacritic patterns appear identical in a diacritic-less setting. In this paper we present it maximum entropy approach for restoring short vowels and other diacritics in an Arabic document. The approach can easily integrate and make effective use of diverse types of information; the model we propose integrates a wide array of lexical, segment-based and part-of-speech tag features. The combination of these feature types leads to a high-performance diacritic restoration model. Using a publicly available corpus (LDC's Arabic Treebank Part 3), we achieve a diacritic error rate of 5.1%, it segment error rate 8.5%, and it word error rate of 17.3%. In case-ending-less setting, we obtain it diacritic error rate of 2.2%, a segment error rate of 4.0%, and a word error rate of 7.2%. We also show in this paper a comparison of our approach to previously published techniques and we demonstrate the effectiveness of this technique in restoring diacritics in different kind of data such as the dialectal Iraqi Arabic scripts.

In this paper we examine the features of Spanish info-promotional materials, i.e. the official tourist brochures whose aim is to attract visitors and provide them with adequate information, as well as their English versions. We will assess four texts published by the Tourist Board of the Autonomous Government of the principality of Asturias, in Northern Spain. The paper will examine the features (situational, interpersonal, ideational and textual) of the Spanish texts from a functional perspective, in an attempt to explore whether the information included is relevant for the communicative purposes of the texts. The next section will discuss the English translations, with particular reference to grammatical conventions, proper names and lexical choices. In the final discussion, we present some of the shortcomings of the texts and the problems deriving from certain cultural assumptions and linguistic choices. The paper concludes with some remarks about the need to involve specialists from various fields in the production of this type of materials.

The dead complaint texts composed by a relative of Kibarogullari named Bahar Savas from Adana recorded by one 95 years old person and are published for the first time here. There are 6 versions to this dead complaint, of which three are shown here as comparison material: the version of Ismail Gorkem is the most extensive. Those the dead complaint underlying Turkish-Armenian fight of 1909 is here checked by further historical documents. A consistent counterpart for the verbally delivered dead complaint texts, exactly the same as Oztunas remarks form the memory-moderate excessive quantity of the memoirs of Cemal Pasa and Veron Dumehjian as a parallel to those from a German history dictionary. The dead complaint "Kibarlarin Destani" proves innocence of the Turks who are executed and criticizes the attitude of the governor Cemal Pascha and the policy of the government at that time.				alosturk@comu.edu.tr						13	0	0	0	0	MILLI FOLKLOR DERGISI	ANKARA	PK 336, ANKARA, YENISEHR 06420, TURKEY	1300-3984			MILLI FOLKLOR	Milli Folklor	SPR	2009		81					6	17					12	Folklore	Arts &amp; Humanities Citation Index (A&amp;HCI)	Arts & Humanities - Other Topics	471IB	WOS:000268048300002					2022-03-30

Project has been developed in collaboration with Civiche Raccolte Storiche di Milano (Milano Historical Downtown Collections) following a proposal in the framework of the Network of Historical Museums. The project was a transformation in digital form of books; then a web system was implemented to publish, to search text, using booth a textual format (indexed by Google and WW searchable) and the original printing (downloadable in jpg format). A search system using key criteria allows to crosscorrelate dates, overcoming the labour intensive traditional examination. A distributed system for data insertion allows many students collaborate, revising and upgrading the contents. Next step will be the creation of links between the contents of the first tree volumes: Peoples and the content of the fourth: Events where peoples quoted in the dictionary were involved as main actors.

While existing database systems provide some means of storing and querying multilingual data, they suffer from redundancy proportional to the number of language support. In this paper, we propose a system for multilingual data management in distributed environment that stores data in information theoretic way in encoded form with minimum redundancy. Query operation can be performed from the encoded data only and the result is obtained by decompressing it using the corresponding language dictionaries for text data or without dictionary for other data. The system has been evaluated by both syntactic data and real data obtained from a real life schema. We have compared the performance of our system with existing systems. Our system outperformed the existing systems in terms of both space and time.	[Hoque, Abu Sayed Md.

The texts of the corpora are valuable not only as linguistic phenomena, but also as historical documents of the epoch. In the life stories of the people living in tiny villages surrounded by the taiga and tundra the life of a person or of a family being a part of the community life appears to be represented against a background of the events relevant for the whole country. The stories give us a new dimension in understanding our history. They make us better understand how the decisions of the politicians in the centre influence (or not influence) the community life in far-away corners of the country The evolution of the community members' and authorities' (especially educational authorities') attitudes towards the ethnic language can also be traced in them.

This paper reflects on the hegemonic representation of the 2003/4 conflict over the "ownership" of the country's foreshore and seabed by examining specifically how two ideologically potent signifiers, "activist" and "radical", were articulated in a newspaper corpus of over one million words. Our theoretical and methodological approach is structured around a combination of macro-and micro-textual discourse analysis approaches. We justify our particular empirical focus by arguing that the controversy associated with the figures of the (predominantly Maori) radical and the activist can be regarded as both symptomatic and constitutive of wider race relations antagonisms. Our analysis examines the media-political significance of textual presences and absences and presents an overview of how all relevant lexical variants of activist and radical were articulated in our newspaper corpus. We also discuss the political significance of our findings, partly by briefly considering additional empirical evidence of how Maori identities were represented in the corpus.

'Get shot of the lot of them': election reporting of Muslims in British newspapers	PATTERNS OF PREJUDICE			English	Article						anti-Muslim prejudice; British general elections; British Muslims; collocation; critical discourse analysis; election reporting; Islamophobia; journalism; racism; representation of Muslims	JOURNALISM	Journalism provides us with a window on the ways that social, ethnic and religious sameness/diversity is viewed. Hence, an examination of the ideas and arguments in the journalistic media provides us with insights into social ideas and attitudes, specifically into the understandings of who 'we' are and who 'they' are that are circulating at any one time. Richardson examines the ways that British Muslims were represented in British national newspapers, both broadsheet and tabloid, during the general elections of 1997, 2001 and 2005. Two weeks of press reporting immediately prior to each election day were sampled, with any journalistic text referring to 'Islam', 'Muslim' or 'Moslem' in the context of the United Kingdom recorded for analysis. Quantitative analysis, focusing on lexical collocation, was used initially to assess the frequency of key ideational frames in the newspaper reporting of British Muslims over the three elections. The analysis of the sample was enriched, through qualitative critical discourse analysis, to determine how British Muslims were depicted in these journalistic texts. The findings demonstrate a quantitative expansion of reports, and a qualitative shift in the texts' arguments towards a constellation of negative representations.

J	Demeritt, D				Demeritt, David			Dictionaries, disciplines and the future of geography	GEOFORUM			English	Review						Dictionary of human geography; Canon; Geographical knowledge	ENVIRONMENT	This essay contributes to the discussions initiated by Setten [Setten, 2008. Encyclopaedic vision: speculating on The Dictionary of Human Geography. Geoforum 39 (3), 1097-1104], about The Dictionary of Human Geography. Rather than focusing on the identity and relative exclusiveness of the contributors, I emphasize how successive editions of the Dictionary have helped reshape the discipline in two ways. First, the proliferation of texts, like the Dictionary, aimed squarely at a student market has gone hand in hand with a variety of changes to the political economy of publishing in geography, Second, human geography has increasingly come to be defined in terms of its concepts and theories. The paper ends by considering the implications of these changes for disciplinary unity and the future of geography given the increasing prominence of both of integrated environmental science and of GIS.

The unit of analysis are groups of words with related meanings; the software is based on the results of a multiperson annotation experiment that captures reliably identified connections between words in a text. We illustrate the advantages of such a representation by juxtaposing results of a detailed hand-made analysis of Margaret Thatcher's rhetoric with analysis based on the automatically detected groups of words. We both corroborate previous findings regarding Thatcher's rhetorical tools and illuminate additional elements thereof. We suggest that lexical cohesion analysis is a promising technique to bridge the gap between quantitative and qualitative analyses of text as political material, by establishing units that are both robust enough to enable comprehensive coverage and coherent enough to support direct interpretation.

The goal was to spread "Western learning", thought of as the key tool for the industrial and military modernization of the country, among the Chinese ruling class. There was a strong sense of urgency, as the ultimate aim was to defend the Empire against the threat posed by the Western powers to traditional Chinese social and political structures The translators necessarily had to create brand new scientific terminologies to express Western concepts. Among the texts translated in that period were also some works that introduced Western grammatical study into China. This paper presents the results of an inquiry into the lexical creations in the domain of grammar, as evidenced by three of the first Chinese texts dealing with this topic by Wang Fengzao, Ma Jianzhong and Yan Fu. The goal of this investigation is to find out, through an inquiry into the social and cultural context of the three essays, whether the socio-cultural differences between the environments these essays were embedded in had any influence on the invention of modern Chinese grammatical terminology. If some influence can be identified, then it must be evaluated through the assessment of the typologies of words involved in this process of lexification. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AUTISM RESEARCH			English	Article						shape bias; word learning; language; development	LANGUAGE-ACQUISITION; YOUNG-CHILDREN; CATEGORIZATION; COMPREHENSION; INDIVIDUALS; IMPAIRMENT; SYNTAX	Many children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) acquire a sizeable lexicon. However, these children also seem to understand and/or store the meanings of words differently from typically developing children. One of the mechanisms that helps typically developing children learn novel words is the shape bias, in which the referent of a noun is mapped onto the shape of an object, rather than onto its color, texture, or size. We hypothesized that children with autistic disorder would show reduced or absent shape bias. Using the intermodal preferential looking paradigm, we compared the performance of young children with ASD and typically developing children (TYP), across four time points, in their use of shape bias. Neither group showed a shape bias at Visit 1, when half of the children in both groups produced fewer than 50 count nouns. Only the TYP group showed a shape bias at Visits 2, 3, and 4. According to the growth curve analyses, the rate of increase in the shape bias scores over time was significant for the TYP children. The fact that the TYP group showed a shape bias at 24 months of age, whereas children with ASD did not demonstrate a shape bias despite a sizeable vocabulary, supports a dissociation between vocabulary size and principles governing acquisition in ASD children from early in language development.

J	Dedmon, RE				Dedmon, Robert E.			Letter from America: websites for those interested in Geographic Medicine	ASIAN BIOMEDICINE			English	Article								Clinicians, researchers, public health officials, infection control officers, travel medicine practitioners and many other medical professionals are constantly being bombarded with information about new journals and web sites. The array of new information is overwhelming. The National Library of Medicine catalogs contain approximately 5000 medical journals from the USA alone with another 80:from other countries. In order to provide focus for those interested in and responsible for global public health, this report summarizes some of the more reliable reference resources in these areas. Biomedical, technical, climate, and travel issues are constantly challenging our knowledge, experience, and judgment. Infectious diseases are spreading ever more rapidly; microbes are becoming increasingly resistant to medical interventions. Evidence-based medicine has entered our lexicon and is a work-in-progress. The health professional needs both the best and most timely information available. Freedman [1] in 2004 published a comprehensive list of resources in travel medicine, including international authorities such as the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control, USA (CDC), along with a detailed list of journals, textbooks, societies, web sites, listservs, and government resources. These information resources are highly recommended to those interested in travel medicine, especially for those new to the field. This letter gives a brief focus on key resources. New International Health Regulations (IHR's) came into effect in June 2007 [2]. Their importance to travel medicine practitioners have been discussed by Hardiman and Wilder-Smith [3]. The revised International Certificate of Vaccination can be ordered in packets of 50 or more from WHO (www.who.int, available in English, French, and Arabic) and are also available, but only in English and French from the US Government Printing Office (Tel: 1-202-512-1800; or toll-free at 1-866-512-1800).

A value lexicon was developed on the basis of the Schwartz (1992) value theory to extract lexical indicators of values from texts. The convergent, discriminant, and predictive validity of this measure was established using American newspaper content from 1900 to 2000 vis-A-vis existing self-report measures of values and objective indicators of value-expressive behaviors. Results provide empirical support for the use of the value lexicon to study values and value-behavior relations. First, the value lexicon demonstrated convergence with self-report responses of values. Second, values in American newspapers were associated with objective indicators of their corresponding value-expressive behaviors compared with noncorresponding value-expressive behaviors. Third, patterns of values over this 101-year period exhibited meaningful fluctuations with major historical and political events. The discussion describes new possibilities for future research on values in many applied settings with the value lexicon. The discussion also suggests that the principles of the value lexicon could be adopted to measure other psychological constructs of interest to applied psychology.

Rather, the criteria that govern the use and recognition of certain concepts may be satisfied to different degrees in different contexts. In light of this reality, the idealized, static structure of a lexical-ontology like WordNet appears both excessively rigid and unduly fragile when faced with real texts that draw upon different contexts to communicate different world-views. In this paper we describe a syntagmatic, corpus-based approach to redefining the concepts of a lexical-ontology like WordNet in a functional, gradable and context-sensitive fashion. We describe how the most diagnostic properties of concepts, on which these functional definitions are based, can be automatically acquired from the Web, and demonstrate how these properties are more predictive of how concepts are actually used and perceived than properties derived from other sources (such as WordNet itself).

J	Al-Qinai, J				Al-Qinai, Jamal			Pragmatic Interpretation in Translated Texts	VIAL-VIGO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED LINGUISTICS			English	Article						pragmatics; translation; cohesion; implicature; presupposition		A pragmatic approach to translation Studies the rules and principles governing the use of language over and above the rules of syntax or morphology, and what makes some uses of language more appropriate than others in communicative situations. It attempts to explain translation as a procedure and product. The Target Text (TT) will be subject to evaluation not as generated by the linguistic system but as conveyed and manipulated by participants in a communicative situation according to referential and pragmatic standards. The failure of a purely lexical or structural translation stems from ignoring the relation between words as signs and the effect they have on their users. Extra-linguistic or intuitive processes which translators strive to reproduce unscathed in translation should also be considered. We need to grasp the kind of actions an ST author performs combining linguistic and non-linguistic elements against a backdrop of beliefs and cultural values. Aside from the cohesive ties at the textual level, one needs to understand how the ST discourse hangs together logically in order to reproduce a coherent TT. This demands an analysis of the pragmatic elements of presuppositions, implicatures, and acts performed in the Source Text (ST). Establishing cohesive ties within a text may require seeking reference outside the immediate text. The illocutionary functions in one language are relatively autonomous cultural/linguistic categories, but are imaginable by members of other Cultures and are translatable though not without translation loss. Globalization and the spread of literacy may have facilitated the comprehension of performative utterances when explained by approximate glosses or by paraphrase. Yet, it is often the multilayered and culture-specific nature of illocutionary functions that de-universalize their possible interpretati This paper addresses the pragmatic interpretation of culturally-specific texts with examples adduced from a number of distinct settings to illustrate the influence of the pragmatic factors at stake.

In order to query the video data through high-level semantic entities such as objects, events, and relations, these entities should be properly extracted and the corresponding video shots should be annotated accordingly. Video texts, which comprise the caption texts on the frames as well as transcription texts obtained through automatic speech recognition techniques, are valuable sources of information for semantic modeling of the videos. In this paper, we present an approach for the extraction of semantic objects from videos by utilizing lexical resources along with the identification of coreference chains in the corresponding video texts. Coreference is a phenomenon in natural language texts where a number of entities in the text refer to the same real world entity. Therefore, while the domain-specific lexical resources aid in the determination of salient entities in the video text, the identification of coreference chains prevents the superfluous extraction of the same underlying entities due to their different surface forms in the video texts. The proposed approach is significant for its being the first attempt to address the importance of coreference phenomenon in video texts for precise entity extraction during the semantic modeling of news videos with a hands-on application. The approach has been evaluated on Turkish political news texts from the METU Turkish corpus and a number of evaluation problems faced such as sparseness of annotated evaluation data for Turkish are also pointed out together with further research directions to pursue.

However, computer-based understanding of ideological discourse has been considered too difficult to undertake. In this paper we propose a statistical model for ideology discourse. By ideology we mean "a set of general beliefs socially shared by a group of people." For example, Democratic and Republican are two major political ideologies in the United States. The proposed model captures lexical variations due to an ideological text's topic and due to an author or speaker's ideological perspective. To cope with the non-conjugacy of the logistic-normal prior we derive a variational inference algorithm for the model. We evaluate the proposed model on synthetic data a's well as a written and a spoken political discourse. Experimental results strongly support that ideological perspectives are reflected in lexical variations.

J	Izzo, F				Izzo, Francesco			Verdi, the Virgin, and the censor: The politics of the cult of Mary in 'I Lombardi alla Prima Crociata' and 'Giovanna d'Arco' (Giuseppe Verdi)	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MUSICOLOGICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						Giuseppe Verdi; I Lombardi alla prima crociata; Giovanna d'Arco; censorship; religion		Christian elements and themes developed rapidly in mid-nineteenth-century Italian culture. This essay concentrates on Giuseppe Verdi's I Lombardi alla prima crociata ( 1843) and Giovanna d'Arco ( 1845) - the first nineteenth-century Italian operas to include explicit references to the Virgin Mary. Whereas Giselda's prayer to the Virgin in I Lombardi was allowed by the censors with only one minimal emendation, evidence in the autograph score of Giovanna d'Arco reveals that numerous relevant Marian elements in this opera were modified or suppressed. The different attitude of the Milanese censors toward the two operas, both premiered at La Scala, may at first seem contradictory. Examined in the context of contemporary cultural ramifications of the cult of Mary, however, these works and their censorship acquire new meanings, shedding light on the intersections between religion and politics in the phase of the Risorgimento leading to the revolutions of 1848-49. On the one hand, Giselda's character and her prayer embody the feminine mildness, faith, and passivity characteristic of the Catholic-liberal movement, hardly posing a threat to the political and religious status quo. On the other, the Marian elements in Giovanna d'Arco suggest an appropriation of this religious icon for the purposes of an overtly revolutionary agenda, and thus prompted the intervention of the censors. What may at first seem a straightforward instance of religious censorship bears profound political implications, suggests that the censors operated according to contextual or semantic ( rather than merely textual or lexical) criteria, and invites a more nuanced perception of the political meanings of Verdi's works prior to 1848.

J	Ker, J				Ker, James			Roman repraesentatio	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHILOLOGY			English	Article								A dual semantics in the term repraesentare captures both the rhetorical impact of "vividly recalling" and the economic impact of "immediately paying" and thus is a dynamic way of characterizing certain social and political acts referred to within Latin literature in connection with Cicero, Augustus, and the imperial household. A lexical correspondence between repraesentatio and the function of an effigy of the king (representation) within the royal funeral of renaissance France cannot be used to claim a continuity with Roman imperial consecrations, but it may help to suggest why the Roman comparison was so evocative within French receptions of Latin texts.

J	Bassin, M				Bassin, Mark			Civilisations and their discontents: Political geography and geopolitics in the Huntington thesisl	GEOPOLITICS			English	Article								This article considers the place of political geography and geopolitics in Samuel Huntington's celebrated work Clash of Civilizations. It is argued that Huntington's engagement with geography is fundamentally ambivalent. On the one hand, he frames his entire analysis as a form of what he calls political geography, and he invokes geographical factors in various ways throughout the entire text. At the same time, however, he explicitly discounts the significance of space or territory in the civilisational framework that he depicts. An analysis of Huntington's inconsistency in this regard contributes to a broader critique of his overall premises, logic, and conclusions. Beyond this, it provides insight into the uncertain position of geography more broadly in contemporary discourses of international relations and international security. Ultimately, I suggest that the ambivalences in the Clash of Civilizations are indicative of certain ' fault lines' - to borrow from Huntington's own lexicon - that have been characteristic for the American security imagination across much of the twentieth century.

An automatic filtering method for field association words by deleting unnecessary words	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER MATHEMATICS			English	Article						field association words; document classification; unnecessary words; precision; F-measure	INFORMATION-RETRIEVAL MODEL; CLASSIFICATION	Document classification and summarization are very important for document text retrieval. Generally, humans can recognize fields such as [Sports] or [Politics] based on specific words called Field Association ( FA) words in those document fields. The traditional method causes misleading redundant words ( unnecessary words) to be registered because the quality of the resulting FA words depends on learning data pre-classified by hand. Therefore recall and precision of document classification are degraded if the classified fields classified by hand are ambiguous. We propose two criteria: deleting unnecessary words with low frequencies, and deleting unnecessary words using category information. Moreover, using the proposed criteria unnecessary words can be deleted from the FA words dictionary created by the traditional method. Experimental results showed that 25% of 38 372 FA word candidates were identified as unnecessary and deleted automatically when the presented method was used. Furthermore, precision and F-measure were improved by 26% and 15%, respectively, compared with the traditional method.

J	Prasad, L				Prasad, Leela			Text, tradition, and imagination: Evoking the normative in everyday Hindu life	NUMEN-INTERNATIONAL REVIEW FOR THE HISTORY OF RELIGIONS			English	Article							DHARMA; LAW	For over two thousand years, the notion of sastra has had an astonishing presence in Hindu normative thought and culture, and sastras, as codifications of knowledge, have been composed in virtually every aspect of life from love and politics to thieving and horse rearing. The concept of sastra yokes precept and practice in a way that perhaps no other concept in Hindu life does, and indexes a complexity that is understated by dictionary meanings of the term which include "to instruct," "order," "command," "precept," "rules," "scientific treatise," or "lawbook." Drawing on my ethnographic research in the Hindu pilgrimage town of Sringeri, south India, my essay explores how the notion of sastra, or, more widely, the "normative," is expressed in everyday contexts of Sringeri. The location of Sringeri itself is significant. A small town in the lush southwestern mountains of India, Sringeri is famous for its smarta matha (monastery) and its temples which are believed to have been founded by Sankara in approximately 800 A.D. Historical records of the matha show that in an unbroken lineage of over 1200 years, the gurus who head the matha have counseled royalty and laypersons on matters ranging from military campaigns and land disputes to propriety of marriage alliances and business practice. The matha today is an influential interpreter of the Hindu codes of conduct, the Dharmasastras, for a large following of Hindus in south India. To a visitor to Sringeri, the monastic institution with its emphasis on sastra, would seem to symbolize a normative centrality in the lives of Sringeri residents. However, conversations and oral narratives from Sringeri challenge this assumption, and demonstrate that sastra is one concept among others such as paddhati (custom), acara (proper conduct), sampradaya (tradition), and niyama (principle; restraint) that individuals employ to indicate moral authority and enactment. While these terms are often used interchangeably, they highlight subtle differences in agency, textuality, historicity, jurisdiction, and permissibility in the context of the normative. I argue that underlying ethical practice is a dynamically-constituted "text" that draws on and weaves together various sources of the normative - a sacred book, an exemplar, a tradition, a principle, and so on. Such a text is essentially an imagined text, a fluid "text" which engages precept and practice, and in a sense, is always intermediary. In this imagined text, the normative manifests as emergent, situated in the local and the larger-than-local, the historical, and the interpersonal.

Exceptions are made for important political and religious texts and in scripts for beginning students of Arabic. Script without diacritics have considerable ambiguity because many words with different diacritic patterns appear identical in a diacritic-less setting. We propose in this paper a maximum entropy approach for restoring diacritics in a document. The approach can easily integrate and make effective use of diverse types of information; the model we propose integrates a wide array of lexical, segment-based and part-of-speech tag features. The combination of these feature types leads to a state-of-the-art diacritization model. Using a publicly available corpus (LDC's Arabic Treebank Part 3), we achieve a diacritic error rate of 5.1%, a segment error rate 8.5%, and a word error rate of 17.3%. In case-ending-less setting, we obtain a diacritic error rate of 2.2%, a segment error rate 4.0%, and a word error rate of 7.2%.

Most of these tasks involve term matching and rely on lexical resources: lists of words with attached information, including inflected forms and derived words, etc. Such resources are publicly available for the English language with the UMLS Specialist Lexicon, but not in other languages. For the French language, several teams have worked on the subject and built local lexical resources. The goal of the present work is to pool and unify these resources and to add extensively to them by exploiting medical terminologies and corpora, resulting in a unified medical lexicon for French (UMLF). This paper exposes the issues raised by such an objective, describes the methods on which the project relies and illustrates them with experimental results. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Using this precious text for the history of costume, the author proposes to explore a particular type of ornament ribbon - which, from the second half of the thirteenth century began to be severely prohibited by communal legislation. Deriving from Byzantium, ribbons which border the hem, neckline, sleeves or are placed at shoulder or waist level had adorned clothing of the Middle Ages as well as provided decoration for ecclesiastical garments (in the latter case the ribbon was called a freggia). Lexical analysis of the description of approximately 120 items of clothing allows the author to clarify various types of ornament, sewing and cloth - the materials used for making fourteenth century Florentine women's clothing more precious.										9	0	0	0	0	CASA EDITRICE LEO S OLSCHKI	FLORENCE	CASELLA POSTALE 66 VIUZZO DEL POZZETTO, I-50126 FLORENCE, ITALY	0391-7770			ARCH STORICO ITAL	Arch.

However, due to the political and historical situation of Taiwan, few people can read these materials at present. It is regrettable that the utilization of these plentiful materials is very low. This paper addresses problems raised by the Taiwanese tone sandhi system by describing a set of computational rules to approximate this system, as well as the results obtained from our implementation. Using the Taiwanese Latinization text as source, we take the sentence as the unit, translate every word into Chinese via a Taiwanese-Chinese dictionary, and obtain the POS information from the CKIP dictionary made by the CKIP group of the Academia Sinica. Using the POS data and tone sandhi rules we formulated based on linguistics, we then tag each syllable with its post-sandhi tone marker, Finally we implemented a Taiwanese tone sandhi processing system which takes a Latinized sentence as input and outputs the tone markers. We were able to obtain an accuracy rate of 97.56% and 88.90% with training and testing data, respectively. We analyze the sources of error for the Purpose of future improvement.

We draw inspiration from latent semantic analysis (LSA) theory, which posits that factor analysis can successfully model human language. We suggest that the factor analysis of word frequencies generated from any political text-for example, open-ended survey responses-provides adequate content analysis categories and can substitute for more commonly practiced techniques. The method proceeds in three steps: data preparation, exploratory factor analyses, and hypothesis testing. This method may produce other benefits by allowing the data to speak more clearly in the development of coding dictionaries while avoiding the problems of inferential circularity common in other data-driven approaches. We demonstrate the method using responses collected in the execution of an experimental design dealing with the topic of partial-birth abortion and assess the demonstration by presenting a human coding of the same material.

J	Wang, YZ; Zhu, SC				Wang, YZ; Zhu, SC			Analysis and synthesis of textured motion: Particles and waves	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						textured motion; generative model; texton; statistical learning; object tracking; stochastic gradient		Natural scenes contain a wide range of textured motion phenomena which are characterized by the movement of a large amount of particle and wave elements, such as falling snow, wavy water, and dancing grass. In this paper, we present a generative model for representing these motion patterns and study a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm for inferring the generative representation from observed video sequences. Our generative model consists of three components. The first is a photometric model which represents an image as a linear superposition of image bases selected from a generic and overcomplete dictionary. The dictionary contains Gabor and LoG bases for point/particle elements and Fourier bases for wave elements. These bases compete to explain the input images and transfer them to a token (base) representation with an O(10(2))- fold dimension reduction. The second component is a geometric model which groups spatially adjacent tokens (bases) and their motion trajectories into a number of moving elements - called "motons." A moton is a deformable template in time-space representing a moving element, such as a falling snowflake or a flying bird. The third component is a dynamic model which characterizes the motion of particles, waves, and their interactions. For example, the motion of particle objects floating in a river, such as leaves and balls, should be coupled with the motion of waves. The trajectories of these moving elements are represented by coupled Markov chains. The dynamic model also includes probabilistic representations for the birth/death (source/sink) of the motons. We adopt a stochastic gradient algorithm for learning and inference. Given an input video sequence, the algorithm iterates two steps: 1) computing the motons and their trajectories by a number of reversible Markov chain jumps, and 2) learning the parameters that govern the geometric deformations and motion dynamics. Novel video sequences are synthesized from the learned models and, by editing the model parameters, we demonstrate the controllability of the generative model.

It was predicted that multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) would indicate that three of these variables could be used to group the politicians on the basis of their published policy positions. MDS indicated that the language of the politicians could be plotted on two dimensions. Activity, with an angle of 31.8 degrees, and Optimism, with an angle of 35.9 degrees, represent the first dimension. Realism loaded significantly on Dimension 2 which has an angle of 42.2 degrees. Limitations of text analysis programs are considered together with suggestions for future developments.

J	Dransfield, E; Morrot, G; Martin, JF; Ngapo, TM				Dransfield, E; Morrot, G; Martin, JF; Ngapo, TM			The application of a text clustering statistical analysis to aid the interpretation of focus group interviews	FOOD QUALITY AND PREFERENCE			English	Article						focus group; analysis; context; pig production; pork quality		Focus group interviews provide qualitative information with a richness of a human interaction but their comparability is limited by their subjective analysis. An objective lexical analysis, based on word and sentence correspondence, was used to analyse text from four group interviews and three summary reviews. Analysis of the interviews, concerning pig production and pork quality, gave 5 main contexts that contained 80% of the original text. These related to 'political', 'quality' and 'animal production', which were much broader contexts than indicated in the original questioning routes. The rural men group contributed significantly more to the political context and rural women more to the quality context data. Analysis of the summary reviews showed a simpler overall contextual structure but it depended on the reviewer. It is proposed that objective lexical analysis has a useful role to play in the interpretation of focus group interviews. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The interactions and the governments between syntactic structure and prosodic structure were still unresolved challenges. By using Part-of-Speech tagging (hence POS), lexical information of text was required, we aimed to find significant patterns of word grouping from analyzing real speech data and such lexical information. This paper reported discrepancies found between lexical words (hence LW) parsed from text and prosodic words (hence PW) annotated from speech data, and proposed a statistical model to predict PWs from LWs. In statistical model, both length of the word and the tagging from POS are two essential features to predict PWs, and the results showed approximately 90% of prediction for PWs, however, it did leave more room for extension. We believe that evidence from PW predictions is a first step towards building prosody models from text.

J	Brugidou, M				Brugidou, M			Argumentation and values: An analysis of ordinary political competence via an open-ended question	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PUBLIC OPINION RESEARCH			English	Article								Through an analysis of answers to an open-ended question, this research seeks to demonstrate the argumentative competence of "laymen" in a salient issue of public debate (in this case the future of nuclear power). The hypothesis is that ordinary citizens, in their justification process, use the same type of rhetorical device that politicians do. This hypothesis can be further refined by postulating that these topoi, self-evident propositions that are shared by all and that therefore remain implicit in the enthymeme, are values. The Alceste method used here favors a statistical approach that identifies, within a given text corpus (the answers to the open-ended question), homogeneous subsets of verbatims on the basis of their lexical profile. The classes of answers garnered can be characterized by the available sociological variables in the survey, whether they are socio-demographic or attitudinal. By classifying free responses used to justify an initial stand, we can identify typical arguments. We then show how it is possible to reconstruct a rhetorical syllogism, or enthymeme, and thus attempt to retrieve the implicit value supporting the reasoning.

J	Rios, JM; Palacios, FF; Gonzalez, MD; Sandoval, MM				Rios, JM; Palacios, FF; Gonzalez, MD; Sandoval, MM			Meaning construction about mental health in general population from marginal-urban community.	SALUD MENTAL			Spanish	Article						meanings; mental health; community; poverty; gender	PSYCHIATRIC MORBIDITY	The situation in which Latin America lives and the implications that economical crises have on mental health are a reality for many families struggling for survival. Particularly in Mexico, problems related to health and social security are notoriously lacking among the poorest sectors mental health being one of the most unattended areas. Different studies have consistently reported low use of mental health services among urban population. Regardless of the diverse reasons which explain this situation, the meanings that people attribute to their emotional distress art not seriously considered by attention care programs, thus broadening the existent gap between health professionals and the population who receives these services. As part of a wider study on social representations of mental health in adult population of a marginal urban community, the goal of this work is to know how the meanings regarding mental health are built, by identifying the structure of the discourse on this matter provided by interviewees. Our objective is to offer an exploratory and comprehensive approach to the way people feel and confer meaning to emotional distress in daily live. The population under study belongs to a community of 3,016 inhabitants located in the south of Mexico City: it is a poor setting which lacks 211 public services: drinking water, drainage, street lighting, transportation, etc. Sixteen in depth interviews were held with the adult population of the community Participants were aged between 27 to 58 years, with an average age of 36 years; 70% were women and 30% men. The topics of study were: a) general description about the community, b) ailments perceived in the community and attributions to them, c) responses to these ailments, d) social support networks and care seeking, e) meanings of mental health-related concepts. Qualitative analysis of information was completed through two different strategies: a) thematic analysis and b) textual analysis. Thematic analysis was based on the identification of categories and subcategories from the issues being studied. This work only includes data about perception of distress and the sources of concern. Alcohol use in male adults, as well as teenage drug use, and family violence were the most important problems perceived by the community. Other problems were language and learning difficulties in children. The perceived insecurity of the district, the lack of public services and the corruption of leaders and authorities were the most common sources of concern. Textual analysis - Alceste software program was used to study the distribution of the vocabulary of this particular corpus of words. It was used to explore the field of social representation as associated to mental health discourse. This is a mathematical text classifier based on the development of statistic technique applied to linguistic or discursive data analysis according to Benzecri. This methodology is focused on the statistic distribution of words succession that compose the statements of the text, disregarding the discourses syntax but considering the "co-occurrence" or simultaneous presence of various lexical items (nouns, adjectives, verbs) in the same sentence and excluding "tool words" from the analysis (conjunctions, prepositions, articles, negatives, etc.). For practical means, the program divides the text into pseudo -statements known as "elementary context units" (ECU), formed by successions from 8 to 20 lexical items (nouns, adjectives, verbs). Descending hierarchical classification is the main statistical procedure carried out through this program, it is similar to clus The program groups the ECU into classes, associated to a particular vocabulary To interpret the classes it is necessary to take into account the specific vocabulary within the class which characterizes a particular contextual field. Analysis yielded four types of semantic levels related to the universe of daily life or the context of sufferings and emotional distress present among the studied population: a) family and vital cycle, b) domestic and extradomestic work, c) political and community organization, and d) emotional aspects and communication within the family While the discourse about emotions as well as about domestic and extradomestic work is basically a female discourse, the sphere about politics and community organization belong to the male domain. The discourse about emotional aspects was the most important for the participants. It is interesting because among this population it has traditionally been considered that mental health related problems are a secondary factor compared to other health problems. Emotional aspects seem to be closely related not only to family problems and dynamics but also to the different stages of the family history, as well as to social and material life conditions. These findings provide information about the gender importance regarding the use of spaces, in the area of work. Women talked a lot about their work at home, child rising, and about private space reserved for family relations and reproduction. Men's most representative discourse was about politics, and community, and political power. However, even when female and male gender roles are clearly defined at a social representation level in the community, men are expected to be economic providers for their families and women should dedicate exclusively to nursing and caring for their family. In practice, women have a very active participation not only inside their families, performing activities traditionally appointed to men (e.g., bricklayer assistant) to increase family income, but also participating in the community work to supply then with basic services (such as lighting, water, etc.) In this sense, women constitute a high risk group. Besides being the main economic suppliers for their families, they carry out other activities under stress conditions, "hidden" from their partners who often maltreat and abuse them. Our findings arc discussed in regard to the implications of using both textual and thematic analyses to offer a more comprehensive approach of the socio-cultural context in which the distress is experienced by the social actors involved in these processes. This allows to widen the definition of how mental health problems are considered, from the community members' perspective. Only in this way the indissoluble link between mental health problems and social economic inequities, gender discrimination, political violence, malnutrition and precarious health conditions will be evidenced.

J	Pedro Ricoy, RD				Pedro Ricoy, RD			The influence of English in 'Tiempo de silencio' by Luis Martin-Santos: Problems of translation	BULLETIN OF HISPANIC STUDIES			Spanish	Article								This paper examines the translatability issues raised by the influence of English on Tiempo de silencio by Luis Martin-Santos, a novel that criticises. Spanish identity at the height of Franco's dictatorship. Censorship could not stop those who were able to read between the lines from grasping the author's scathing attack on the aftermath of the Spanish Civil War. Material, cultural and spiritual poverty, as a theme, is set against the higher levels of development and prosperity of other countries. This novel is narrated from an ironic perspective. The criticism of the social and political status quo is underscored by the utilisation of foreignizing formal elements and the imitation of foreign styles and authors disapproved of or even banned, by the regime. This mirroring of form and content emphasises cultural differences, in particular those regarding English-speaking countries. An analysis at the phonetic, graphical, lexical and grammatical levels reveals that what is obvious from the source text becomes lost in its translation into English, as the original impact of anglicised prose cannot be reproduced in English. Thus it can be argued that the presentation of culturally autochthonous concepts in a foreign key leads to relative untranslatability.

At the same time there is an urgent need for a variety of applications including local language spell-checkers, word processors, machine translation systems, search engines, etc. For these applications to be developed, the existence of computerized language resources and a well developed framework for research in this area is essential. Tree-banks, Part-of-speech taggers, computerized grammars, lexica, and parsers are all necessary parts of this framework. The study reported in this article describes an attempt to design and implement a prototype of an automatic sentence parser for Amharic text. Amharic is the official government language of Ethiopia and a language for which very few computational linguistic resources exist. To automatically parse sentences, the study used the Inside Outside algorithm with a bottom up chart parsing strategy. The probabilistic context free grammar was used as a grammatical formalism to represent the phrase structure rules of the language. A small sample corpus of 100 four-word sentences was selected from sentences in the language, and has been used to serve as a training and test set. In spite of the limited amount of data and other resources available, the experiments show some promising results.

In this paper, we describe our efforts to create a robust, large-scale lexical-semantic resource for the recognition and classification of expressions of commonsense psychology in English Text. We achieve high levels of precision and recall by hand-authoring sets of local grammars for commonsense psychology concepts, and show that this approach can achieve classification performance greater than that obtained by using machine learning techniques. We demonstrate the utility of this resource for large-scale corpus analysis by identifying references to adversarial and competitive goals in political speeches throughout U.S. history.

Examples supporting both Levy's hypothesis (the vocabulary of a translation is more general than that of the source text), and that of Kundera (the vocabulary of a translation is more specific and varied than that of the source text) are found, even though it is not always easy to categorise the French equivalents as more general or more specific. Therefore no general tendencies governing the entire corpus, that is French translated biblical text, seem to exist. Instead, a certain relationship between translation strategy and target group can be noticed when applying Vermeer's skopos hypothesis, which relates the quality of a translation to its purpose. Finally, some aspects on possible complications, which might concern the developer of a computerised evaluation tool applicable to this particular type of study, are discussed.										16	0	0	0	0	E J BRILL	PA LEIDEN	PO BOX 9000, NL-2300 PA LEIDEN, NETHERLANDS			90-04-12495-0				2002							463	474					12	Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Religion	Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science &amp; Humanities (CPCI-SSH)	Computer Science; Religion	BW77G	WOS:000183129200025					2022-03-30

Conversely, manual work is the traditional way for syntactic information acquisition in the dependency approach, which considers the correspondence between semantic valences and theirs syntactic realizations. The last approximation has some advantages for description of languages with relaxed word order constraints and a vast prepositional use.

C	Hoosain, R		Kao, HSR; Leong, CK; Gao, DG		Hoosain, R			Speed of getting at the phonology and meaning of Chinese words	COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE STUDIES OF THE CHINESE LANGUAGE			English	Proceedings Paper	International Symposium on Cognitive Processes of the Chinese Language	AUG 29-SEP 02, 1997	HONG KONG, PEOPLES R CHINA	Univ Hong Kong			CROSSED APHASIA; LEXICAL ACCESS; TIME-COURSE; ENGLISH; RECOGNITION; ACTIVATION; CHARACTERS; FREQUENCY; TASK	In psycholinguistic studies of the Chinese language we have witnessed two myths. An earlier one was that processing of the ideographic symbols is lateralized in the right hemisphere. Its empirical support came from: (a) the finding of greater Stroop effect for Chinese, with Biederman and Tsao (1979) suggesting that both the processing of colours and Chinese colour names were lateralized in the right hemisphere and thus producing greater interference compared with colour names printed in English, (b) reports of crossed aphasia in Chinese aphasic patients (e.g., April & Tse, 1977), with right hemisphere damage resulting in language impairment, and (c) the contrast in findings of left visual field (right hemisphere) advantage for single Chinese characters and right visual field (left hemisphere) advantage for two-character Chinese words. It was thought that single characters were visual wholes while two-character words involved sequential or analytic processing, and the right and left hemispheres respectively specialized in holistic and analytic processing. Eventually, when we obtained a better picture, the incidence of crossed-aphasia for Chinese did not appear higher than for English (cf. April & Han, 1980). It was also realized that the difference between single characters and two-character words in tachistoscopic perception was due to the degradation of the visual signal related to exposure time and other stimulus factors, and not any particular orthographic characteristic of Chinese (Hasuike, Tzeng Hung, 1986; Ho & Hoosain, 1989). The other myth is that getting at the meaning of Chinese words is more direct than English. The origin of this myth could be traced to observations by distinguished linguists such as Yuen Ren Chao and William Wang. Chao (1968) thought that when reading Chinese text the characters stared the reader in the face. Although referring only to pictographs which make up a small percentage of Chinese characters, Wang (1973) thought that when looking at the character for horse, we could almost see the animal galloping in front of us. In the tradition of psycholinguistics going after the psychological reality of linguistic notions (notably of transformational grammar in the sixties), investigators of Chinese psycholinguistics have been working on the question of directness of access to meaning of characters for the past two decades. My view is that, in contrast to the earlier myth of cerebral lateralization, this one of more direct access to Chinese meaning is 'one of truest myths in Chinese mythology' (in the words of Chao, 1968, referring to another-the monosyllabic myth). I shall briefly discuss the evidence for this position in the rest of this paper. As with any other orthography, processing the meaning of Chinese words has to take place in some temporal relationship with processing of phonology. Of course, we are not just interested in the question of which process takes place sooner or can be completed faster, but also the implications that could be drawn. For example, if it could be established that getting at the meaning of a word can be faster that getting at the pronunciation, then it is possible to argue that the former can be done without the latter. In other words, phonological recoding is not necessary for accessing meaning of words. And in doing so, we get some understanding of the reading process. The comparison of the speed of accessing phonology versus meaning, in the context of possible orthographic difference between Chinese and English, can be expressed in the form of a four-fold table indicated in Figure 1. The speed of access can be looked at both within a given language and between different languages. This provides some converging evidence for the question at hand. What is indicated in Figure 1 represents a good set of working hypotheses that is viable in the context of available evidence so far. The underlying reason for three of the four notations in Figure 1 (except for the faster times for accessing phonology compared with accessing meaning of English) is the nature of script-sound-meaning relations in Chinese. One crucial aspect of Chinese orthography is that while almost all characters are each a morphemic unit, pronunciation of [GRAPHICS] a character is not spelled out, but has to be memorized individually. In other words, phonology has to be addressed and not assembled. Even if the phonetic radicals within some Chinese characters have similar pronunciation as the characters in which they are embedded, which are the ones that do and which do not are not rule governed and have to be learned individually. The pronunciation of the phonetic radicals themselves (which are often individual characters on their own, and there are about 800 of them) after all has to be memorized individually. If the primary function of elements of the orthography is not to assemble phonology (as is the case with letters of the alphabet) the script-sound-meaning relation raises the possibility that the reading process is different.

A natural language understanding system and the fall-sentence analysis would provide a better way to resolve such problems. But the practical application of natural language understanding is still far from being achieved and full sentence analysis in the current state is not only difficult to implement but also time consuming. For those reasons a Korean Grammar Checker using the partial parsing method and the conception of potential governing relationship is implemented. The paper improves the knowledge base of disambiguation rules while trying to reduce them with the result of the linguistic analysis. The extended lexical disambiguation rules and the parsing method based on the asymmetric relation that we propose thus guarantee the accuracy and efficiency of the Grammar Checker.

The coverage is first approached through the analysis of lexical choices, followed by propositional analysis. A discussion section is intended to interpret those differences, in terms of the selectiveness of the newspapers, in light of Simpson's definition of ideology. The conclusions drawn from the previous analyses are finally tested by corpus analysis, which lends further support to the preceding text analysis. This article intends to emphasize that, behind the differences in coverage, there is consensus, that is, news coverage is closely in line with its underlying ideological positions, which is instantiated politically, culturally and institutionally.

Vocabulary development is a crucial area of research because it relates closely to cognitive development (Anderson Freebody, 1981; Terman, 1916; Wechsler, 1949) and academic achievement (Miller, 1988; Saville-Troike, 1984; Stanovich, 1986). In language development, vocabulary serves as basic building blocks in generating and understanding sentences (Miller, 1991) and in reading competence (Anderson Freebody, 1981; Beck et al., 1987; Chall, 1958; Graves, 1986; Miller, 1988; Nagy Anderson, 1984; Nagy & Herman 1987). Studies of vocabulary acquisition can therefore provide a window on the process of language acquisition as a whole (Clark, 1995). A large number of teaching and learning strategies have been advanced to promote learners' lexical development, but few of them have given satisfying answers. In contrast to the large amount of published materials on vocabulary learning, little is known about how learners acquire and develop their vocabulary (Nation, 1990). Research into Chinese vocabulary has seen experiments examining aspects of words, such as characters and radicals, but studies into Chinese vocabulary acquisition are relatively under-developed. Hong Kong educational reform has attracted considerable attention and gained mounting urgency in the last decade of the twentieth century because of the unprecedented political changes and their consequential impact on societal goals, education processes and their fulfilment. There is an urgent need to undertake investigations to determine the vocabulary benchmarks of students and to gain understanding on how they develop their vocabulary knowledge so as to benefit Chinese language education. This study aims at helping to meet this need by providing empirical evidence on the lexical development of Hong Kong secondary students by assessing and comparing their word knowledge on the basis of newspaper and textbook corpuses.

COMPUTER VISION - ECCV 2002, PT IV	LECTURE NOTES IN COMPUTER SCIENCE		English	Article; Proceedings Paper	7th European Conference on Computer Vision	MAY 28-31, 2002	COPENHAGEN, DENMARK	IT Univ Copenhagen, Univ Copenhagen, Lund Univ				Textons refer to fundamental micro-structures in generic natural images and thus constitute the basic elements in early (pre-attentive) visual perception. However, the word "texton" remains a vague concept in the literature of computer vision and visual perception, and a precise mathematical definition has yet to be found. In this article, we argue that the definition of texton should be governed by a sound mathematical model of images, and the set of textons must be learned from, or best tuned to, an image ensemble. We adopt a generative image model that an image is a superposition of bases from an over-complete dictionary, then a texton is defined as a mini-template that consists of a varying number of image bases with some geometric and photometric configurations. By analogy to physics, if image bases are like protons, neutrons and electrons, then textons are like atoms. Then a small number of textons can be learned from training images as repeating micro-structures. We report four experiments for comparison. The first experiment computes clusters in feature space of filter responses. The second use transformed component analysis in both feature space and image patches. The third adopts a two-layer generative model where an image is generated by image bases and image bases are generated by textons. The fourth experiment shows textons from motion image sequences, which we call movetons.

A series of assessments conducted post-stroke revealed that KB functioned in the normal range for most verbal skills. However, compared with controls matched in age and music training, KB showed severe loss of pitch and rhythmic processing abilities. His ability to recognise and identify familiar instrumental melodies was also lost. Despite these deficits, KB performed remarkably well when asked to recognise and identify familiar song melodies presented without accompanying lyrics. This dissociation between the ability to recognise/identify song vs. instrumental melodies was replicated across different sets of musical materials, including newly learned melodies. Analyses of the acoustical and musical features of song and instrumental melodies discounted an explanation of the dissociation based on these features alone. Rather, the results suggest a functional dissociation resulting from a focal brain lesion. We propose that, in the case of song melodies, there remains sufficient activation in KB's melody analysis system to coactivate an intact representation of both associative information and the lyrics in the speech lexicon, making recognition and identification possible. In the case of instrumental melodies, no such associative processes exist; thus recognition and identification do not occur.

J	Siegel, E; Reiner, B				Siegel, E; Reiner, B			Electronic teaching files: Seven-year experience using a commercial picture archiving and communication system	JOURNAL OF DIGITAL IMAGING			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Annual Meeting of the Society-for-Computer-Applications-in-Radiology	MAY 03-06, 2001	SALT LAKE CITY, UT	Soc Comp Applicat Radiol				With the advent of electronic imaging and the internet, the ability to create, search, access, and archive digital imaging teaching files has dramatically improved. Despite the fact that a picture archival and communication system (PACS) has the potential to greatly simplify the creation of, archival, and access to a department or multifacility teaching file, this potential has not yet been satisfactorily realized in our own and most other PACS installations. Several limitations of the teaching file tools within our PACS have become apparent over time. These have, at our facility, resulted in a substantially reduced role of the teaching file tools for conferences, daily teaching, and research purposes. With the PACS at our institution, academic folders can only be created by the systems engineer, which often serves as an impediment to the teaching process. Once these folders are created, multiple steps are required to identify the appropriate folders, and subsequently save images. Difficulties exist for those attempting to search for the teaching file images. Without pre-existing knowledge of the folder name and contents, it is difficult to query the system for specific images. This is due to the fact that there is currently no fully satisfactory mechanism for categorizing, indexing, and searching cases using the PACS. There is currently no easy mechanism to save teaching, research, or clinical files onto a CD or other removable media or to automatically strip demographic or other patient information from the images. PACS vendors should provide much more sophisticated tools to create and annotate teaching file images in an easy to use but standard format (possibly Radiological Society of North America's Medical Image Resource Center [MIRC] format) that could be exchanged with other sites and other vendors' PAC systems. The privilege to create teaching or conference files should be given to the individual radiologists, technologists, and other users, and an audit should be kept of who has created these files, as well as keep track of who has accessed the files. Vendors should maintain a local PACS library of image quality phantoms, normal variants, and interesting cases and should have the capability of accessing central image repositories such as the RSNA's MIRC images. Commercial PAC systems should utilize a standard lexicon to facilitate the creation and categorization of images, as well as to facilitate sharing of images and related text with other sites. This should be combined with a very easy to use mechanism to write images and related text when appropriate onto removable media (while maintaining a high level of security and confidentiality) to make it easier to share images for teaching, research, or clinical purposes. This is a US government work. There are no restrictions on its use.

J	Campion, N; Rossi, JP				Campion, N; Rossi, JP			Associative and causal constraints in the process of generating predictive inferences	DISCOURSE PROCESSES			English	Article							TIME-COURSE; TEXT COMPREHENSION; NARRATIVE TEXT; MEMORY	Four experiments investigated how the reading of semantic associates of a predictive inference raised its activation level. Two kinds of semantic associations were distinguished: those that could causally relate text events to the inference in a representation of the described situation and those that could not. Lexical decision data indicated that in both cases the predictive inferences were activated to the same high level (Experiment 1), even when no other causal support of the inference could be found in the text (Experiment 3). However, the results of a judgment task performed at various delays (immediately after the reading of the predictive sentences, at a 3-sentence delay, and after the reading of all the texts) suggests that readers evaluate the plausibility of the predictive inferences on the basis of their causal support from text events. These findings suggest that the initial activation of predictive inferences mainly results from the associative constraints governing the elaborative process of the meaning of text words. The causal constraints of the predictive inferences intervene later to eventually reinforce the integration of the inference to readers' representation. The compatibility of these results with the comprehension models of Kintsch (1988, 1998) is discussed.

J	Vegnaduzzo, S				Vegnaduzzo, S			The subjunctive in subordinate clauses in Old Italian	LINGUA E STILE			Italian	Article								This paper has carried out a corpus-based investigation of subjunctive in Old Italian texts. Following modern generative syntactic theories we have distinguished two types of subjunctive: intensional (and subtypes thereof: volitive, epistemic and factive) and polar. We have documented the extent and variation of occurrences of subjunctive: a) governed by lexical categories: verbs, nouns, and adjectives (intensional); b) in the syntactic domain of selected operators such as negation(polar). On the basis of data extracted from the corpus we observed two main generalizations. The first is distributional: in Old Italian the subjunctive mood could appear in fewer context types than in Modern Italian(although the token frequency for a given type can be even very high). The second is interpretive: in Old Italian subjunctive expressed semantic dependency much more than it does today. Evidence for this is given by the almost complete absence of subjunctive in factive contexts(where in Modern Italian it can freely alternate with indicative basically without meaning difference, thus working as a pure marker of syntactic subordination) and the rich array of polar subjunctive(which are semantically licensed in a way similar to negative polarity items).										3	0	0	0	0	SOC ED IL MULINO	BOLOGNA	STRADA MAGGIORE 37, 40125 BOLOGNA, ITALY	0024-385X			LINGUA STILE	Ling.

Hypertext, a language for organizing knowledge on a modular rather than a sequential basis, provides an opportunity to unscramble this verbal mixture and to reconstitute it with new understandings and a new source of creative political discourse. This article reports on an experiment in computer-assisted advancement of political theory. It presents the initial results of a hypertextual approach to the conceptual basis of the literature by: (1) selecting the concepts most frequently employed in a sample of political science dictionaries; (2) linking them to a number of textual and bibliographical sources for in-depth analysis; and (3) developing multi-dimensional linkages by placing each concept in a matrix of logically consistent relationships. Thanks to the Web, Hypertext opens the door to unlimited navigation through wider and wider domains. The Hyperpolitics platform is an attempt to make this compatible with the logical structure and informed guidance of higher learning.

J	Gomez, S; Mena, E; Turci, ASEI				Gomez, S; Mena, E; Turci, ASEI			Content analysis applied to weekly newspapers	PSICOTHEMA			Spanish	Article; Proceedings Paper	6th Methodology Conference	SEP, 1999	OVIEDO, SPAIN					The main object of the present paper is to verify whether or not the language used by the selected authors is what attracts the wide range of public which constitutes the receptors of our analysis corpus. Our hypothesis arises from the following interrogative: What characteristics are necessary, as regards subject matter and language, for a medium to be compatible with newspapers of different tendencies and an ample range of diverse readers? In order to study the elitist or accessible treatment of the subject matter, the level of political commitment, the cultural references, the language register and the sintactic construction, we commenced by reading the articles which make up the corpus we proposed to analyse. We considered that the content analysis, a standard technique in observational methodology, would help to confirm or dismiss our working hypothesis as it would provide a series of methodological instruments specific to this type of approach. The common denominator of these techniques is that they are based on deduction and they move between two extremes: the rigour of objetivity and the harmony provided by subjetivity. The analyitical aim of this type of analysis is the identification and explanation of the different elements which confer meaning to any communication. After carrying out the analysis we have reached the following conclusions: 1. With regard to the vocabulary, we found it to be a rich vocabulary, as would correspond to professional writers. The lexical content corresponds, in general, to a standard register with the inclusion of some idiomatic words or phrases to be found in colloquial or even vulgar language. 2. As regards the subject matter, it was observed that the authors chose subjects which required little political commitment. In fact, they habitually used a description of manners style, cultural and historical references and comments on current affairs with the addition of a personal touch. 3. An exhaustive study of the sintaxis would have resulted in a different classification which would have been comprised of the coordination and subordination, divided into subcategories, which would have accounted for the different types of coordination, as well as the subordination, thus establishing a different register unit -the sentence. This study would allow us to verify the level of sintactic complexity which would complete the subject matter analysis which has been carried out using the word and its frequency of use as the register unit In the present study, as regards the sintaxis, we have in fact observed the use of conjunctions or relative pronouns: deducing that the texts use a simple sintactic construction which can be easily understood by a reader of a medium cultural level. These three conclusions: a rich but accessible vocabulary, non-conflictive subject matter and simple sintactic construction, corroborate the preliminary hypothesis which we expounded at the commencement.

WORLD BANK HEADQUARTERS			Sweden, through its governmental development cooperation agency, the Swedish International Development Agency (SIDA), has supported basic education programs in developing countries since the early 1970s. An intrinsic part of this support is assistance for educational materials, which has taken many forms over the years, from the international purchase of textbooks and other special materials such as atlases and dictionaries, to support to local publishing and printing. Assistance has not been confined to the purchase or production and distribution of textbooks alone; it has also included for example, the development of materials for literacy campaigns, the establishment of Braille presses, support to environmental magazines for schools, curriculum development for both formal and nonformal education, and the establishment of reading rooms and rural libraries.

The system is based on the theory of Government and Binding for the syntactic part and Conceptual Graphs for the discourse analysis part. The system is modular and largely domain independent. The corpus of abstracts for which it is being developed contains abstracts from Analytical Abstracts Online. The current status of the system is that the grammar is finished and that the lexicon and the discourse module are under development. Preliminary results are that the system is capable of analyzing six abstracts on various analytical techniques.

J	Thibault, PJ; vanLeeuwen, T				Thibault, PJ; vanLeeuwen, T			Grammar, society, and the speech act: Renewing the connections	JOURNAL OF PRAGMATICS			English	Article								The division of language into syntax, semantics, and pragmatics is widely accepted. In this view, speech acts cannot be specified on the basis of lexicogrammatical criteria. Instead, they belong in a separate 'pragmatics' of utterances in their contexts-of-use. We see this as an 'exporting' model of language, as it 'exports' speech acts out of grammar, and recognises as grammatical only such structures as encode propositional meanings. 'Importing' models, on the other hand, 'import' what others would see as pragmatic into grammar itself, and allow speech acts to be specified on the basis of lexicogrammatical criteria. The paper examines the classic speech act theorists (Austin, Searle) and some recent developments in linguistic pragmatics (Leech, Levinson, Sperber and Wilson). These theorists rely on orthodox conceptions of grammar. Recent developments in functional and discourse-based grammars provide an alternative perspective. Here, the relationship between grammar and discourse is a central concern. Many problems in the theory of speech acts can be solved by these developments. We also discuss Habermas's re-reading of speech act theory. For us, the ethical and political dimensions of speech acts (cf. validity claims) and lexicogrammar are not separable. Two text analyses conclude the article.

Hyona, P. Niemi, and G. Underwood (1989) provided evidence suggesting that in reading, the initial fixation lands farther into a word has an informative as opposed to a redundant ending. The finding points to the potential importance of the within-word information distribution in determining fixation locations in words. However, the reliability of the effect has been recently challenged by K. Rayner and R. Morris (1992). The current study did not find much support for the notion that the relative informativeness of word endings would be a relevant factor in eye guidance. On the other hand, it did show that a highly irregular letter cluster in the beginning of a word attracts a fixation closer toward the word beginning, particularly to the space prior to the word. This finding is discussed in light of visual guidance models that emphasize the relevance of word length and spacing information for governing the eyes through a text.

Our study is based on four premises borrowed from research in semiotics, cognitive science, discourse analysis and reading theories: Text is a kind of interwoven result of multiple semiotic systems which intermingle: editorial, lexical, syntactic, semantic, representational, communicational, argumentation systems, etc. Reading is a kind of nonlinear route picking up various units and various properties inside those systems, governed by various schematas. As a social act it can be accomplished with certain constant interpretative processes but as an individual act it can give rise to different results. In a professional reading perspective such as classifying, indexing or abstracting, the units and the properties of these units considered pertinent by a cognitive agent are different not only in relation to goals, but also in relation to the image the reader has of the result to be achieved. The indexing terms maintain intertextual links with the primary texts and/or their abstracts as well as with thesaurus and classification system. A comparison of the original text and the products of different readings is particularly fertile inasmuch as multiple semiotic properties can be observed. We report the methodology employed and some of the findings obtained by comparing properties of indexing terms with the content of titles and abstracts of 833 bibliographic records extracted from a database on environment. We are able to characterize some tendencies of the special reading which indexing constitutes as a series of properties of the selected or rejected words and to explain the differences among several indexers by the properties toward which they are inclined. This can help us pinpoint the image they create as a group or as individuals of what constitutes a good indexing term.

The author examines what Marx and Engels really said about this complex of issues, which sets of problems they thus opened up, and which they were unable to address. The logic of one sphere (housework) should not be forced into the logic of another (wage labour); rather, the development of political strategies should follow from an analysis of the differences and connections between the two spheres.										15	0	0	0	1	ARGUMENT-VERLAG GMBH	HAMBURG 13	RENTZELSTRASSE 1, W-2000 HAMBURG 13, GERMANY	0004-1157			ARGUMENT		NOV-DEC	1994	36	6					911	916					6	Political Science	Social Science Citation Index (SSCI)	Government & Law	QD306	WOS:A1994QD30600004					2022-03-30

The study focuses on factors governing the use of spatial concepts and the ways in which they are mapped into linguistic form. This involves a comparison of the concepts used in linearizing information and establishing cohesion in descriptions and shows how systematic preferences for one set of spatial concepts over another when describing the relative location of objects can be attributed to general principles of organization at text level The grammatical and lexical structure of locative expressions in English and German also reflects requirements defined by language-specific patterns of information organization. These factors lead to different preferences in conceptualizing subject matter for expression, given a specific communicative task.

J	KESTIN, J				KESTIN, J			INTERNAL VARIABLES IN THE LOCAL-EQUILIBRIUM APPROXIMATION	JOURNAL OF NON-EQUILIBRIUM THERMODYNAMICS			English	Article								The aim of this contribution is to explore the basis and consequences of the formalism known in the literature as the method of local equilibrium. The view is taken that contemporary controversies regarding the foundations of thermodynamics are rooted not only in different sets of concepts and principles, but also in semantics. Therefore, an attempt is made here to use a consistent group of terms, each of whose dictionary meaning corresponds to its physical nature as closely as possible. Since the intention is to study irreversible processes in systems in which even locally there prevails a state of nonequilibrium, the term local equilibrium is abandoned in favor of the phrase principle of local state. In defining the thermodynamic state of a system, a distinction is made between the intensive parameters which appear in the physical space (Kontaktgroessen) and those which describe states of constrained equilibrium in the Gibbsian phase (state) space. The latter consists of a set of extensive variables (internal energy U, external deformation parameters a and the internal deformation variables alpha) because, in contrast with intensive variables, they can be measured in equilibrium as well as in nonequilibrium. The properties and uses of the internal variables are outlined following P.W. Bridgman's proposal. The principle of local state is applied by associating with every nonequilibrium state n an accompanying equilibrium state e of equal values of U, a, alpha, and by asserting that the entropy SBAR assignable in physical space and temperature TBAR measured in it can be approximated by the values S and T calculated in the Gibbsian phase space by standard, classical methods. A continuous sequence of accompanying equilibrium states (curve R in phase space) is called an accompanying reversible process, it is conceived as an adiabatic projection of the continuous sequence of nonequilibrium states which constitute the irreversible process I. This allows us to cast the classical Gibbs equation in rate form and to derive explicit expressions for the rate of entropy production THETA by eliminating the rate du/dt between it and the energy balance equation. The nature of the approximation involved in this procedure is made explicit. Hence, the preference to speak of the local state approximation. The essential part of the method consists in the formulation of the Gibbs equation for the accompanying reversible process in the phase spice. This is obtained from the knowledge of the physics of the situation and leads to the identification of the internal deformation variables and the hypothetical virtual (i.e., reversible) work done against them. The Gibbs equation forms the basis for the derivation of an explicit form of the local rate of entropy production and a rational formulation of the rate equations between the generalized forces and fluxes which appear in it. The union between the rate equations and the fundamental equation relating the extensive variables of the constrained equilibrium states in phase space yields the constitutive law for the system. The constitutive law with the rate equations inserted into the appropriate conservation laws produces the set of partial differential equations which govern the process. Their solution, in the form of a set of time-dependent fields, subject to the appropriate boundary conditions constitutes the irreversible process under study. It is noted that the local-state approximation, made explicit in this paper, has been used and tested in fluid mechanics though its validity is contested in contemporary continuum mechanics and mechanics of solids. The author takes the view that these principal theories of irreversible processes, as they occur in engineering applications, fit into the same formalism, as expounded in the text.

J	COWLEY, CK; JONES, DM				COWLEY, CK; JONES, DM			SYNTHESIZED OR DIGITIZED - A GUIDE TO THE USE OF COMPUTER SPEECH	APPLIED ERGONOMICS			English	Article						COMPUTERS; SPEECH; MESSAGES; SYNTHESIZED; DIGITIZED		In addition to technical and cost determinants, a range, of human factors issues governs the appropriateness of synthesized or digitized speech for a particular system. For example, since synthesized messages are created textually, they may reflect the rules and habits of written language, rather than spoken language. This may cause listeners some difficulty interpreting the intended meaning of the message. Moreover, the different speech media place constraints upon techniques of message creation, editing, transmission and reception. Synthesized speech is easy to edit in terms of lexical content, but the production of sophisticated prosodic features can be problematic. In contrast, unedited digitized speech will normally have appropriate prosodic cues and because of this will be difficult to edit. The influence of these factors is examined and illustrations of both good and poor practice are given. The paper concludes with a decision criteria checklist for speech output devices.

J	DELMONTE, R				DELMONTE, R			SEMANTIC PARSING WITH LFG AND CONCEPTUAL REPRESENTATIONS	COMPUTERS AND THE HUMANITIES			English	Article						LFG THEORY; FUNCTIONAL REPRESENTATION; LEXICAL REPRESENTATION; PROLOG PARSING; LOGICAL FORM; CONCEPTUAL REPRESENTATION; MEANING AND INFERENCE; KL-ONE; ANAPHORA RESOLUTION; TIME REFERENCE REPRESENTATION		A semantic parser is presented which aims at the attainment of a high linguistic coverage and an extendibility to many languages. To this end, a frequency distionary for Italian has been classified following LFG theoretical framework and a general decoder has been implemented to pass from the syntactic. to the semantic and conceptual levels. Syntactic structural derivation is produced by complete lexical froms, lexical redundancy rules and an extended phrase structure grammar which has been implemented in Prolog using XGs. Semantic and conceptual representation are produced following Jackendoff's system of conceptual representations plus a number of additions to compute time reference mainly inspired by J. Allen's system (1983a, b). We believe that a text rethorical organizations is mainly governed by linguistic principles like the alternation of FOCUS and TOPIC, the use of definiteness to qualify referring expressions, etc. We describe two algorithm to analyse the level of text: Logical Form, which provides scope assignment to quantified expressions; an algorithm for anaphora resolution which incorporates linguistic information and a number of psycholinguistic heuristic. Finally, we briefly describe how the inference engine provided by KL-ONE is integrated into the previous modules to produce semantic entailment and linguistic inferences.
