We argue that citizens' impolite and/or uncivil behavior is one possible explanation for such decisions. Social media conversations are rife with harassment and politicians are a prime target. This alters the incentive structure of engaging in dialogue on social media. We use Spanish, Greek, German, and U.K. candidates' tweets sent during the run-up to the recent European Parliament elections, and rely on automated text analysis and machine learning methods to measure their level of civility. Our contribution is an actor-oriented theory of political dialogue that incorporates Twitter's specific affordances, clarifying how and why Twitter's democratic promise may be limited.","[Theocharis, Yannis; Popa, Sebastian Adrian] Univ Mannheim, Mannheim Ctr European Social Res, D-68159 Mannheim, Germany; [Barbera, Pablo] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Sch Int Relat, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA; [Fazekas, Zoltan] Univ Oslo, Dept Polit Sci, N-0317 Oslo, Norway; [Parnet, Olivier] Kantar Publ, B-1160 Brussels, Belgium",,"Theocharis, Y (corresponding author), Univ Mannheim, Mannheim Ctr European Social Res, D-68159 Mannheim, Germany.",yannis.theocharis@uni-mannheim.de,"Barberá, Pablo/G-1893-2016; Theocharis, Yannis/Q-8336-2019","Barberá, Pablo/0000-0002-9063-4829; Theocharis, Yannis/0000-0001-7209-9669",Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation; Alfred P.

Borrowing sophisticated tools and resources from computer science and computational linguistics, journalism scholars have started to gain insights into the constant information flow and made big data a regular feature of the scientific debate. Both deductive (manual and semi-automated) and inductive (fully automated) text analysis methods are part of this new toolset. In order to make the automated research process more tangible and provide an insight into the options available, we provide a roadmap of common (semi-) automated options for text analysis. We describe the assumptions and workflows of rule-based approaches, dictionaries, supervised machine learning, document clustering, and topic models. We show that automated methods have different strengths that provide different opportunities, enriching-but not replacing-the range of manual content analysis methods.","[Guenther, Elisabeth; Quandt, Thorsten] Univ Munster, Dept Commun, Munster, Germany",,"Gunther, E (corresponding author), Univ Munster, Dept Commun, Munster, Germany.",elisabeth.guenther@uni-muenster.de,"Quandt, Thorsten/ABE-4668-2021","Quandt, Thorsten/0000-0003-1937-0282",,,,,33,37,37,2,27,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

This study provides an exhaustive comparison of sentiment analysis methods, using a validation set of Dutch economic headlines to compare the performance of manual annotation, crowd coding, numerous dictionaries and machine learning using both traditional and deep learning algorithms. The three main conclusions of this article are that: (1) The best performance is still attained with trained human or crowd coding; (2) None of the used dictionaries come close to acceptable levels of validity; and (3) machine learning, especially deep learning, substantially outperforms dictionary-based methods but falls short of human performance. From these findings, we stress the importance of always validating automatic text analysis methods before usage. Moreover, we provide a recommended step-by-step approach for (automated) text analysis projects to ensure both efficiency and validity.","[van Atteveldt, Wouter; van der Velden, Mariken A. C.

We argue that rational and emotional styles of communication ebb and flow within public discussions about social problems due to the alternating influence of social contagion and saturation effects. These cognitive-emotional currents create an opportunity structure whereby advocacy organizations stimulate more conversation if they produce emotional messages after prolonged rational debate or vice versa. We test this hypothesis using automated text-analysis techniques that measure the frequency of cognitive and emotional language within two advocacy fields on Facebook over 1.5 years, and a web-based application that offered these organizations a complimentary audit of their social media outreach in return for sharing nonpublic data about themselves, their social media audiences, and the broader social context in which they interact. Time-series models reveal strong support for our hypothesis, controlling for 33 confounding factors measured by our Facebook application. We conclude by discussing the implications of our findings for future research on public deliberation, how social contagions relate to each other, and the emerging field of computational social science.","[Bail, Christopher A.] Duke Univ, Sociol & Publ Policy, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Brown, Taylor W.; Mann, Marcus] Duke Univ, Sociol, Durham, NC 27708 USA",,"Bail, CA (corresponding author), Duke Univ, 254 Soc Psych Bldg, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",christopher.bail@duke.edu,,,National Science Foundation [1357223]; Robert Wood Johnson Foundation; Amazon,National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Robert Wood Johnson Foundation(Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF)); Amazon,"This research was made possible by the National Science Foundation (Grant # 1357223), The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, and Amazon.",,139,30,30,5,64,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0003-1224,1939-8271,,AM SOCIOL REV,Am.

In this article we introduce scholars of (digital) journalism studies and communication science to multiverse analysis while addressing the possible reasons of heterogeneity in the findings of research on engagement with news on social media. Using the question of which news article characteristics predict news engagement on social media, this illustration of the multiverse approach shows how different measurement, data processing, and modelling choices lead to divergent conclusions. In particular, we show how the selection of widely used automated text analysis tools and preprocessing steps influence the conclusions drawn from the analysis. We also use this illustration to guide interested scholars through the different steps of doing a multiverse analysis. More broadly, we demonstrate how multiverse analysis can be an open and transparent research approach in a field that is increasingly faced with a wide range of analytical choices.","[Pipal, Christian] Univ Amsterdam, Dept Polit Sci, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Song, Hyunjin] Yonsei Univ, Dept Commun, Seoul, South Korea; [Boomgaarden, Hajo G.] Univ Vienna, Dept Commun, Vienna, Austria",,"Pipal, C (corresponding author), Univ Amsterdam, Dept Polit Sci, Amsterdam, Netherlands.",c.pipal@uva.nl,"Pipal, Christian/ABY-0629-2022","Boomgaarden, Hajo G./0000-0002-5260-1284; Pipal, Christian/0000-0002-5395-2035",European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme [759079],European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme(European Research Council (ERC)),"unding Christian Pipal received funding from the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No 759079, POLEMIC.",,66,0,0,7,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

Although the issue has received some scholarly attention, there is a need to improve the conceptual precision in the increasingly blurry debate. The use of computational communication science approaches allows us to track political conversations in a fine-grained manner within their natural settings - the realm of interactive social media. The present study combines different algorithmic approaches to studying social media data in order to capture both the interactional structure and content of dynamic political talk online. We conducted an analysis of political polarization across social media platforms (analyzing Facebook, Twitter, and WhatsApp) over 16 months, with close to a quarter million online contributions regarding a political controversy in Israel. Our comprehensive measurement of interactive political talk enables us to address three key aspects of political polarization: (1) interactional polarization - homophilic versus heterophilic user interactions; (2) positional polarization - the positions expressed, and (3) affective polarization - the emotions and attitudes expressed. Our findings indicate that political polarization on social media cannot be conceptualized as a unified phenomenon, as there are significant cross-platform differences. While interactions on Twitter largely conform to established expectations (homophilic interaction patterns, aggravating positional polarization, pronounced inter-group hostility), on WhatsApp, de-polarization occurred over time. Surprisingly, Facebook was found to be the least homophilic platform in terms of interactions, positions, and emotions expressed. Our analysis points to key conceptual distinctions and raises important questions about the drivers and dynamics of political polarization online.","[Yarchi, Moran] Interdisciplinary Ctr Herzliya, Sammy Ofer Sch Commun, Kanfei Nesharim St POB 167, IL-46150 Herzliyya, Israel; [Baden, Christian; Kligler-Vilenchik, Neta] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Noah Mozes Dept Commun & Journalism, Jerusalem, Israel",,"Yarchi, M (corresponding author), Interdisciplinary Ctr Herzliya, Sammy Ofer Sch Commun, Kanfei Nesharim St POB 167, IL-46150 Herzliyya, Israel.",moran.yarchi@gmail.com,"Baden, Christian/U-9165-2019; Yarchi, Moran/H-6480-2015; Kligler-Vilenchik, Neta/J-3472-2019","Baden, Christian/0000-0002-3771-3413; Yarchi, Moran/0000-0002-8044-2145; Kligler-Vilenchik, Neta/0000-0003-3470-3305",,,,,63,53,53,35,104,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1058-4609,1091-7675,,POLIT COMMUN,Polit.

In recent times we have seen this flat hierarchical approach fade as commercial stakeholders, platform providers and content publishers continue to design and practice exclusionary processes to ensure their work is visible. This current practice limits the capacity for all voices to be heard, prompting the question how can digital activism remain visible in a media-saturated social media environment? This paper draws on a content analysis of the most popular YouTube users in Australia to illustrate the absence of digital activism within its visual culture. It maps the process of fragmented platformization, called here micro-platformization, to highlight the content production and publishing strategies digital activists should adopt. While successful commercial YouTube practitioners adhere closely to the principles of social media logics (Van Dijck, J., & Poell, T. (2014). Understanding Social Media Logic. Media and Communication, 1(1), 2-14), this paper argues that stakeholders engaging in the practice of digital activism need to adopt similar strategies to their commercial counterparts. By including strategies that reflect the successful practices of social media logics, digital activism can not only become visible across social media spaces, but also engage public discourse on civic matters and public affairs.","[Hutchinson, Jonathon] Univ Sydney, Dept Media & Commun, Room N233,John Woolley Bldg A20,Manning Rd, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia",,"Hutchinson, J (corresponding author), Univ Sydney, Dept Media & Commun, Room N233,John Woolley Bldg A20,Manning Rd, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",jonathon.hutchinson@sydney.edu.au,"Hutchinson, Jonathon/P-7182-2017","Hutchinson, Jonathon/0000-0001-7349-1662",Sydney Social Science and Humanities Advanced Research Centre (SSSHARC) under the Launch Fellowship Scheme,Sydney Social Science and Humanities Advanced Research Centre (SSSHARC) under the Launch Fellowship Scheme,This research was made possible by funding from the Sydney Social Science and Humanities Advanced Research Centre (SSSHARC) under the Launch Fellowship Scheme.,,29,8,8,5,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

It can inflict considerable harm on any victims who are targeted, create a sense of fear and exclusion amongst their communities, toxify public discourse and motivate other forms of extremist and hateful behavior. Accordingly, there is a pressing need for automated tools to detect and classify Islamophobic hate speech robustly and at scale, thereby enabling quantitative analyses of large textual datasets, such as those collected from social media. Previous research has mostly approached the automated detection of hate speech as a binary task. However, the varied nature of Islamophobia means that this is often inappropriate for both theoretically informed social science and effective monitoring of social media platforms. Drawing on in-depth conceptual work we build an automated software tool which distinguishes between non-Islamophobic, weak Islamophobic and strong Islamophobic content. Accuracy is 77.6% and balanced accuracy is 83%.

This study includes novel and comprehensive data on the effects of a presidential announcement on public opinion.

Like the Occupy Wall Street protesters in the United States, the indignant activists of Spain and Greece protested against unjust, unequal, and corrupt political and economic institutions marked by the arrogance of those in power. Social media can potentially change or contribute to the political communication, mobilization, and organization of social movements. To what extent did these three movements use social media in such ways? To answer this question a comparative content analysis of tweets sent during the heydays of each of the campaigns is conducted. The results indicate that, although Twitter was used significantly for political discussion and to communicate protest information, calls for participation were not predominant. Only a very small minority of tweets referred to protest organization and coordination issues. Furthermore, comparing the actual content of the Twitter information exchanges reveals similarities as well as differences among the three movements, which can be explained by the different national contexts.","[Theocharis, Yannis] Univ Mannheim, Dept Polit Sci, D-68159 Mannheim, Germany; [Lowe, Will] Univ Mannheim, Mannheim Ctr European Social Res MZES, D-68159 Mannheim, Germany; [van Deth, Jan W.] Univ Mannheim, Chair Polit Sci & Int Comparat Social Res, D-68159 Mannheim, Germany; [Garcia-Albacete, Gema] Autonomous Univ Madrid, Dept Polit Sci, E-28049 Madrid, Spain",,"Theocharis, Y (corresponding author), Univ Mannheim, Dept Polit Sci, A5,6 Bauteil A, D-68159 Mannheim, Germany.",yannis.theocharis@uni-mannheim.de; will.lowe@uni-mannheim.de; jvdeth@uni-mannheim.de; gema.garcia@uam.es,"Theocharis, Yannis/Q-8336-2019; García-Albacete, Gema M/ABA-7247-2021; Garcia-Albacete, Gema M/F-3397-2013","Theocharis, Yannis/0000-0001-7209-9669; García-Albacete, Gema M/0000-0002-2457-5699; Garcia-Albacete, Gema M/0000-0002-2457-5699; Lowe, Will/0000-0002-1549-6163",,,,,44,192,197,12,268,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

The rhetoric that political elites employ structures civic discourse. The emergence of social media platforms as a medium of politics has enabled ordinary citizens to express their ideological inclinations by adopting the lexicon of political elites. This avails to researchers a rich new source of data in the study of political ideology. However, existing ideological text-scaling methods fail to produce meaningful inferences when applied to the short, informal style of textual content that is characteristic of social media platforms such as Twitter. This paper introduces the first viable approach to the estimation of individual-level ideological positions derived from social media content. This method allows us to position social media users-be they political elites, parties, or citizens-along a shared ideological dimension. We validate the proposed method by demonstrating correlation with existing measures of ideology across various political contexts and multiple languages. We further demonstrate the ability of ideological estimates to capture derivative signal by predicting out-of-sample, individual-level voting intentions. We posit that social media data can, when properly modeled, better capture derivative signal than discrete scales used in more traditional survey instruments.","[Temporao, Mickael; Dufresne, Yannick] Univ Laval, Dept Sci Polit, Laval, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada; [Vande Kerckhove, Corentin; Hendrickx, Julien M.] Catholic Univ Louvain, Large Graphs & Networks Grp, Louvain La Neuve, Belgium; [van der Linden, Clifton] Univ Toronto, Dept Polit Sci, Toronto, ON M5S 3G3, Canada",,"Temporao, M (corresponding author), Univ Laval, Dept Sci Polit, Laval, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada.",mickael.temporao.1@ulaval.ca,"Hendrickx, Julien/AFL-9332-2022","Temporao, Mickael/0000-0003-4689-2852; van der Linden, Clifton/0000-0001-5649-2970","Canada Foundation for Innovation (CFI); ministere de l'Economie, de la science et de l'innovation du Quebec (MESI); Fonds de recherche du Quebec-Nature et technologies (FRQ-NT)","Canada Foundation for Innovation (CFI)(Canada Foundation for Innovation); ministere de l'Economie, de la science et de l'innovation du Quebec (MESI); Fonds de recherche du Quebec-Nature et technologies (FRQ-NT)","We thank Francois Gelineau, Thierry Giasson, William Jacoby, Jonathan N.

We use supervised machine learning to classify whether these Twitter and Facebook account data are content related to politics. We then benchmark our survey measures on frequency of posting about politics and the number of political figures followed. We find that, on average, our self-reported survey measures tend to correlate with observed social media activity. At the same time, we also find a worrying amount of individual-level discrepancy and problems related to extreme outliers. Our recommendations are twofold. The first is for survey questions about social media use to provide respondents with options covering a wider range of activity, especially in the long tail. The second is for survey questions to include specific content and anchors defining what it means for a post to be about politics.","[Guess, Andrew] Princeton Univ, Polit & Publ Affairs, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Munger, Kevin] Princeton Univ, Ctr Study Democrat Polit, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Nagler, Jonathan; Tucker, Joshua] NYU, Polit, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Nagler, Jonathan; Tucker, Joshua] NYU, Social Media & Polit Participat SMaPP Lab, New York, NY 10003 USA",,"Guess, A (corresponding author), Princeton Univ, Dept Polit, 213 Fisher Hall, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",aguess@princeton.edu,"Guess, Andrew/J-4904-2019","Guess, Andrew/0000-0003-2974-7848",INSPIRE program of the National Science Foundation [SES-1248077],INSPIRE program of the National Science Foundation,"This study has been approved by the New York University Institutional Review Board (IRB-12-9058, IRB-FY2017-150).

We find that repression deterred imprisoned Saudis from continuing to dissent online. However, it did not suppress dissent overall. Twitter followers of the imprisoned Saudis engaged in more online dissent, including criticizing the ruling family and calling for regime change. Repression drew public attention to arrested Saudis and their causes, and other prominent figures in Saudi Arabia were not deterred by the repression of their peers and continued to dissent online.","[Pan, Jennifer] Stanford Univ, Dept Commun, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Siegel, Alexandra A.] Stanford Univ, Immigrat Policy Lab, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",,"Pan, J (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Dept Commun, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",jp1@stanford.edu; aasiegel@stanford.edu,"Siegel, Alexandra A./M-1331-2019","Siegel, Alexandra A./0000-0003-0792-7813; Pan, Jennifer/0000-0002-4818-0122",Stanford King Center on Global Poverty and Development; National Science Foundation [1647450],Stanford King Center on Global Poverty and Development; National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"Our thanks to Charles Crabtree, Killian Clarke, Christian Davenport, Martin Dimitrov, Jennifer Earl, Will Hobbs, Holger Kern, Beatriz Magaloni, Elizabeth Nugent, Molly Roberts, Arturas Rozenas, Anton Sobolev, Rory Truex, Lauren Young, Zachary SteinertThrelkeld, and participants at the 2018 APSA pre-conference on politics and computational social science for their helpful comments and suggestions; to SMaPP Global for making our collaboration possible; to the Stanford King Center on Global Poverty and Development and the National Science Foundation (Award #1647450) for research support.

This challenges journalism to anticipate the changes that social media trigger in the use and production of (news) media. In this paper, we focus on personal branding on Twitter. Journalists are increasingly encouraged to develop a personal brand on Twitter. This offers them the opportunity to become news and opinion hubs and to increase their market value. Erving Goffman's theatre metaphor is used as an analytical framework in which journalists are conceptualized as performers who are acting on a stage in front of an audience. Through a quantitative content analysis of the tweeting behaviour of 40 employed and freelance journalists, we explore the way they use social media to present themselves and which dilemma's they are facing. We analyse tweeting behaviour in terms of the types of tweets, functions of tweets and modes of interaction. The quantitative content analysis is supplemented with in-depth interviews with 12 journalists, in order to analyse the reasoning behind their social media habits. Our findings show that journalists particularly struggle with being factual or opinionated, being personal or professional, how to balance broadcasting their message with engagement and how to promote themselves strategically.","[Brems, Cara; Temmerman, Martina] Vrije Univ Brussel, TTKA Journalism, Brussels, Belgium; [Brems, Cara; Graham, Todd; Broersma, Marcel] Univ Groningen, Ctr Media & Journalism Studies, Groningen, Netherlands",,"Broersma, M (corresponding author), Univ Groningen, Ctr Media & Journalism Studies, Groningen, Netherlands.",cbrems@vub.ac.be; matemmer@vub.ac.be; t.s.graham@rug.nl; m.j.broersma@rug.nl,,"Graham, Todd/0000-0002-5634-7623; Broersma, Marcel/0000-0002-7342-3472; Temmerman, Martina/0000-0002-1482-8488",international scientific cooperation RUG VUB [OZR2546],international scientific cooperation RUG VUB,This work was supported by the international scientific cooperation RUG & VUB (Theme: Media and Journalism) under [grant number OZR2546].,,33,98,99,9,56,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

Taking mediatization theory as a starting point, I transferred assumptions about accommodation into the domain of social media. By conducting a content analysis of Facebook posts made by members of the Bundestag, the German Parliament, from 2010 to 2015, I analyzed whether political actors had adapted their communication to social media logic and more often used message features previously demonstrated to increase the number of interactions. Among the results, politicians had increasingly used message features that had previously raised the number of interactions, including new technical opportunities and social affordances on Facebook, whereas their use of established communication strategies had remained relatively stable. At the individual level, politicians with higher status were more likely to incorporate successful strategies, which suggests that accommodation is constrained by available resources.","[Jost, Pablo] Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Dept Commun, Mainz, Germany",,"Jost, P (corresponding author), Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Dept Commun, Jakob Welder Weg 12, D-55199 Mainz, Germany.",pjost@uni-mainz.de,,"Jost, Pablo/0000-0001-9267-1773",,,,,57,0,0,0,0,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1933-1681,1933-169X,,J INF TECHNOL POLITI,J.

However, despite these platforms' increasing accessibility, disabled activists may struggle in creating their counter-narrative. Their inability to conform to able-bodied notions of activism leaves their individual experiences out of the discussion of social media activism. This paper addresses this gap by presenting the individual decision-making process of disabled social media users regarding activists' performances in social media as gleaned from the qualitative analysis of in-depth interviews. This process includes three phases that demonstrate the experiences of social media users with communicative concealable disabilities - autistics, hard-of-hearing (HoH), and people who stutter. First, these interviewees present a spectrum of perceptions of disability activism in social media. Second, these perceptions lead to a spectrum of motivations, which mirror the interviewees' various risk-benefit calculations regarding public self-disclosure as disabled. Third, these perceptions and motivations are manifested through interviewees' strategic design of their activist performances in private and public spheres. By rethinking key concepts in social media activism - risk-benefit calculation, slacktivism, and digital storytelling - this process illustrates taken-for-granted assumptions of personalization, visibility and representation, that challenge current discussions on social media activism.","[Bitman, Nomy] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Commun & Journalism, IL-9190501 Jerusalem, Israel",,"Bitman, N (corresponding author), Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Commun & Journalism, IL-9190501 Jerusalem, Israel.",nomy.bitman@mail.huji.ac.il,,,,,,,52,0,0,5,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

Using textual and content analysis, we conducted two studies to explore how health organizations engage with the public via Twitter chats during the Ebola and Zika outbreaks. In official records of Ebola chats, the organization addressed both hostile and neutral public questions that pressed for specification of disease characteristics and protocol. However, in a content analysis of all public tweets sent during a later Zika chat, we found that questions were privileged, and other tweet forms and themes were excluded from the participatory space. Specifically, public comments demonstrating expertise or extending the topic of the chat were not addressed by the organization. Our analysis provides insight into the implicit rules governing how organizations engage with the public online during a rapidly evolving health crisis.

In this article, a qualitative study with 18 refugees from Syria, Eritrea and Afghanistan is presented in order to investigate the uses and purposes of social media associated to the different areas of refugee integration in the Netherlands. The results indicate that social media networking sites were particularly relevant for refugee participants to acquire language and cultural competences, as well as to build both bonding and bridging social capital. Another important finding concerns the role of government, host society and the agency of refugee actors in determining the way refugees experience social media.

Digital platforms have reduced the gatekeeping power of traditional media and, potentially, they have increased the capacity of various kinds of actors to shape the agenda. We study this question in the Swiss context by examining the connections between three agendas: the traditional media agenda, the social media agenda of parties, and the social media agenda of politicians. Specifically, we validate and apply supervised machine learning classifiers to categorize 2.78 million articles published in 84 newspapers, 6,500 tweets posted on official party accounts, and 210,000 tweets posted by politicians on their own accounts from January 2018 until December 2019. We first use the classifier to measure the salience of the four most relevant issues of the period: the environment, Europe, gender equality, and immigration. Then, using a vector autoregression (VAR) approach, we analyze the relationship between the three agendas. Results show that not only do the traditional media agenda, the social media agenda of parties, and the social media agenda of politicians influence one another but, overall, no agenda leads the others more than it is led by them. There is one important exception: for the environment issue, the social media agenda of parties is more predictive of the traditional media agenda than vice-versa. These findings underscore how closely different agendas are tied together, but also show that advocacy campaigns may play an important role in both constraining and enabling parties to push their specific agendas.","[Gilardi, Fabrizio; Gessler, Theresa; Kubli, Mael] Univ Zurich, Dept Polit Sci, Affolternstr 56, CH-8050 Zurich, Switzerland; [Muller, Stefan] Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Polit & Int Relat, Dublin, Ireland",,"Gilardi, F (corresponding author), Univ Zurich, Dept Polit Sci, Affolternstr 56, CH-8050 Zurich, Switzerland.",gilardi@ipz.uzh.ch,"Gilardi, Fabrizio/AGF-1855-2022; Gessler, Theresa/AAB-5676-2019","Gessler, Theresa/0000-0003-2339-6266; Muller, Stefan/0000-0002-6315-4125; Gilardi, Fabrizio/0000-0002-0635-3048; Kubli, Mael/0000-0002-5592-9648",Swiss National Science Foundation [10DL11_183120]; European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union [883121],Swiss National Science Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)European Commission); European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union(European Research Council (ERC)),This project received funding from the Swiss National Science Foundation (grant nr. 10DL11_183120) and the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program (grant agreement nr. 883121),,71,13,13,36,77,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1058-4609,1091-7675,,POLIT COMMUN,Polit.

However, the interpersonal relations implied byfenxiang, and the political order implied bygongxiang, are quite different from those conveyed by 'sharing'. Together,fenxiangandgongxiangconstruct a convergence of micro-level interpersonal harmony and macro-level social harmony. Thus, the language of sharing becomes the lens through which to observe the subtlety, complexity and idiosyncrasies of the Chinese internet. This article offers a new heuristic for understanding Chinese social media, while also pointing to an important facet of the discursive construction of Chinese social media.

While much of the public discourse surrounding platforms evolves at a policy level between think tanks, journalists, academics and political actors, little attention is paid to how people think about regulation of and by platforms. Through a representative survey study of US internet users (N = 1,022), we explore antecedents of support for social media content moderation by platforms, as well as for regulation of social media platforms by the government. We connect these findings to presumed effects on self (PME1) and others (PME3), concepts that lie at the core of third-person effect (TPE) and influence of presumed influence (IPI) scholarship. We identify third-person perceptions for social media content: Perceived negative effects are stronger for others than for oneself. A first-person perception operates on the platform level: The beneficial effects of social media platforms are perceived to be stronger for the self than for society. At the behavioral level, we identify age, education, opposition to censorship, and perceived negative effects of social media content on others (PME3) as significant predictors of support for content moderation. Concerning support for regulation of platforms by the government, we find significant effects of opposition to censorship, perceived intentional censorship, frequency of social media use, and trust in platforms. We argue that stakeholders involved in platform governance must take more seriously the attitudes of their constituents.","[Riedl, Martin J.; Wallace, Ryan] Univ Texas Austin, Sch Journalism & Media, 1 Univ Stn A1000, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Whipple, Kelsey N.] Univ Massachusetts, Journalism Dept, Amherst, MA 01003 USA",,"Riedl, MJ (corresponding author), Univ Texas Austin, Sch Journalism & Media, 1 Univ Stn A1000, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",martin.riedl@utexas.edu,"Riedl, Martin Johannes/AAN-7489-2020","Riedl, Martin Johannes/0000-0003-2411-1998; Wallace, Ryan/0000-0003-1795-759X",Graduate School at the University of Texas at Austin; Center for Media Engagement at the University of Texas at Austin,Graduate School at the University of Texas at Austin; Center for Media Engagement at the University of Texas at Austin,"This work was supported by The Graduate School, as well as by the Center for Media Engagement, both at the University of Texas at Austin.",,63,2,2,16,55,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

The use of those sources is argued to increase news consumers' attentiveness to the news item. We investigate whether online outlets use the ordinary citizen less frequently, both generally speaking as well as a source, while relying more on social media posts. Our empirical analysis focuses on a comparison between two online quality outlets (nrc.nl and vk.nl), two online popular outlets (nu.nl and telegraaf.nl), two offline quality outlets (NRC Handelsblad and de Volkskrant) and two offline popular outlets (Algemeen Dablad and de Telegraaf). Overall, results suggest a limited use of ordinary citizens as news sources, and even less use of social media. Multivariate logistic regression models, controlling for the length of news items as well as the day of publishing, 'show that offline outlets use ordinary citizens more often, while online outlets rely more on social media'. Additionally, we find the differences between popular and quality outlets a lot less pronounced, with the latter only making slight more use of social media sources.","[Vliegenthart, Rens; Boukes, Mark] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Sch Commun Res, Amsterdam, Netherlands",,"Vliegenthart, R (corresponding author), Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Sch Commun Res, Amsterdam, Netherlands.",r.vliegenthart@uva.nl; markboukes@gmail.com,"Boukes, Mark/K-5090-2014","Boukes, Mark/0000-0002-3377-6281",Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek [016.145.369],Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)European Commission),This work was supported by Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek [grant number: 016.145.369].,,53,10,10,2,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

Social media have fundamentally altered how information reaches people. This study examines opinion leadership in social media networks and argues that opinion leaders may no longer need to rely on information provided by the media if they have access to first-hand information. To test this assumption empirically, we used data from the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP21). Attendees of the conference had direct information about what was happening, which they were able to share live with their followers via social media. We used geo-located tweets to identify Twitter users who attended the COP21 summit. We then located these users in a data set of tweets that were collected based on the main conference hashtag (#COP21) and represent the wider social media debate on the conference. Our results, which are based on network analysis measures and Twitter user data, show that COP21 participants were more central actors compared to the average user in the network, and that they were more likely to have brokering positions. They were also more involved in the debate and received more attention from other users. We used automated content analysis to divide COP21 participants into different actor types and performed the analysis by actor group. The results show only minor differences across the actors and support the robustness of our analysis.","[Walter, Stefanie; Brueggemann, Michael] Univ Hamburg, Inst Journalism & Commun Sci, Allende Pl 1, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany",,"Walter, S (corresponding author), Univ Hamburg, Inst Journalism & Commun Sci, Allende Pl 1, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany.",Stefanie.Walter@uni-hamburg.de,,"Walter, Stefanie/0000-0002-9304-3469",,,,,81,15,15,8,48,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

Media outlets have started to provide news via WhatsApp in addition to other platforms. In journalism scholarship, the routines of messenger app journalism are still little understood. Building on the Diffusions of Innovations theory, this paper explores whether newsrooms treat WhatsApp similar to other social media, which they have used for a longer period of time, or whether they have developed new practices that respect WhatsApp's roots in mobile and interpersonal communication. Focusing on Germany as a case study and drawing on an analysis of 3745 messages sent to WhatsApp channels of news outlets and on an online survey of journalists working with social media (N = 111), this study shows that journalists utilize the innovative possibilities of WhatsApp for news to a varying degree. While some characteristics of mobile communication are considered in news outlets' strategies, engagement with the audience is often neglected. The results highlight the challenges for relational innovations in the editorial process.","[Boczek, Karin] TU Dortmund Univ, Inst Journalist, Dortmund, Germany; [Koppers, Lars] TU Dortmund Univ, Stat, Dortmund, Germany; [Boczek, Karin] Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Mainz, Germany; [Koppers, Lars] Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Karlsruhe, Germany",,"Boczek, K (corresponding author), TU Dortmund Univ, Inst Journalist, Dortmund, Germany.;Boczek, K (corresponding author), Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Mainz, Germany.",karin.boczek@uni-mainz.de,"Boczek, Karin/AAW-3047-2020","Boczek, Karin/0000-0003-1516-4094; Koppers, Lars/0000-0002-1642-9616",,,,,58,14,14,4,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

Yet, there have been no longitudinal studies on journalists' sourcing practices in recent years that allow us to consider the mechanisms of innovation diffusion. Comparative studies of different social platforms in different media systems are just as rare. We therefore examine the use of Facebook and Twitter as journalistic sources in newspapers of three countries. A main finding is that, after a period of stagnation at the beginning of this decade, the use of social media sources has resurged massively in recent years. The patterns of this second rise of social media in journalism are almost identical in the analyzed newspapers. A comparison of the platforms has shown that Twitter is more commonly used as a news source than Facebook. Compared to Facebook, Twitter is primarily used as an elite channel. An unsupervised topic clustering approach (LDA) also revealed that the issues on which social media are sourced and the quantities of social media references are similar in The New York Times and The Guardian. In Suddeutsche Zeitung, however, journalists source social media considerably less, and in different thematic contexts.","[von Nordheim, Gerret; Boczek, Karin] Tech Univ Dortmund, Inst Journalist, Dortmund, Germany; [Koppers, Lars] Tech Univ Dortmund, Fak Stat, Dortmund, Germany",,"von Nordheim, G (corresponding author), Tech Univ Dortmund, Inst Journalist, Dortmund, Germany.",gerret.vonnordheim@tu-dortmund.de; karin.boczek@tu-dortmund.de; koppers@statistik.tu-dortmund.de,"von Nordheim, Gerret/AAO-3952-2020; Boczek, Karin/AAW-3047-2020","Boczek, Karin/0000-0003-1516-4094; von Nordheim, Gerret/0000-0001-7553-3838; Koppers, Lars/0000-0002-1642-9616",,,,,62,45,45,3,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

However, although researchers routinely and conveniently resort to certain forms of human coding to validate the results derived from automated procedures, in practice the actual quality assurance of such a gold standard often goes unchecked. Contemporary practices of validation via manual annotations are far from being acknowledged as best practices in the literature, and the reporting and interpretation of validation procedures differ greatly. We systematically assess the connection between the quality of human judgment in manual annotations and the relative performance evaluations of automated procedures against true standards by relying on large-scale Monte Carlo simulations. The results from the simulations con?rm that there is a substantially greater risk of a researcher reaching an incorrect conclusion regarding the performance of automated procedures when the quality of manual annotations used for validation is not properly ensured. Our contribution should therefore be regarded as a call for the systematic application of high-quality manual validation materials in any political communication study, drawing on automated text analysis procedures.","[Song, Hyunjin; Eberl, Jakob-Moritz; Eisele, Olga; Heidenreich, Tobias; Lind, Fabienne; Galyga, Sebastian] Univ Vienna, Dept Commun, Vienna, Austria; [Boomgaarden, Hajo G.] Univ Vienna, Dept Commun, Empir Social Sci Methods Focus Text Anal, Vienna, Turkey; [Tolochko, Petro] Univ Vienna, Dept Polit Sci, Vienna, Austria; [Greussing, Esther] Tech Univ Carolo Wilhelmina Braunschweig, Dept Commun & Media Sci, Braunschweig, Germany",,"Song, H (corresponding author), Univ Vienna, Dept Commun, Vienna, Austria.",hyunjin.song@univie.ac.at,"Song, Hyunjin/ABD-2100-2020; Eberl, Jakob-Moritz/K-4689-2019; Galyga, Sebastian/AAS-4407-2021","Song, Hyunjin/0000-0001-7752-3035; Eberl, Jakob-Moritz/0000-0002-5613-760X; Galyga, Sebastian/0000-0003-2642-0815; , Fabienne/0000-0002-4978-9415; Tolochko, Petro/0000-0001-5971-8816; Heidenreich, Tobias/0000-0001-9070-0550; Boomgaarden, Hajo G./0000-0002-5260-1284; Eisele, Olga/0000-0002-6604-3498",Austrian Science Fund under the Hertha-Firnberg-Program [T-989],Austrian Science Fund under the Hertha-Firnberg-Program,Olga Eisele is supported by the Austrian Science Fund under the Hertha-Firnberg-Program [Grant no: T-989].,,39,12,12,2,8,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1058-4609,1091-7675,,POLIT COMMUN,Polit.

Outpourings of support teemed in from all across Canada and over the world, prompting the largest charitable response in Canadian Red Cross history. This paper examines Albertans' response to the wildfire by exploring caring and helping behaviors as well as the role of social media in facilitating these remarkable charitable efforts. The paper uses mixed methods including an analysis of the most popular Tweets related to the wildfire and an Alberta survey collected months after the disaster. The analysis of tweets reveals that care, concern, and invitations to help were prominent in social media discourse about the wildfire. The analysis of survey data demonstrates that those who followed news about the wildfire on social media express higher overall levels of care and concern for those affected, which led to helping those impacted by the wildfire. The findings provide important insights about the role of social media in disaster relief and recovery as well as citizens' civic engagement.","[Boulianne, Shelley; Minaker, Joanne] MacEwan Univ, Dept Sociol, Edmonton, AB, Canada; [Haney, Timothy J.] Mt Royal Univ, Ctr Community Disaster Res, Calgary, AB, Canada",,"Boulianne, S (corresponding author), MacEwan Univ, Dept Sociol, Edmonton, AB, Canada.",bouliannes@macewan.ca,"Boulianne, Shelley/D-8411-2013","Boulianne, Shelley/0000-0002-8951-1098",MacEwan University; Mount Royal University's Centre for Community Disaster Research,MacEwan University; Mount Royal University's Centre for Community Disaster Research,This work was supported by MacEwan University and Mount Royal University's Centre for Community Disaster Research.,,48,23,23,3,25,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

A content analysis was conducted on four consecutive weeks of all news items published online by five market-leading Belgian media outlets (N = 10,579) in order to analyse whether the news supply is adapted to what the metrics say and, subsequently, to what extent that metric data is used to promote a softer supply of news on Facebook.

While many scholars have explored dynamics of political cyberprotest (e.g., the ongoing transnational Occupy movement, the 2012 Quebec student strike, the student-led protest movement in Chile between 2011 and 2013), few have studied sub-dynamics relating to ethno-cultural minorities' uses of social media to gain visibility, mobilize support, and engage in political and civil action. We fill part of this gap in the academic literature by investigating uses of Twitter for political engagement in the context of the Canada-based Idle No More movement (INM). This ongoing protest initiative, which emerged in December 2012, seeks to mobilize Indigenous Peoples in Canada and internationally as well as their non-Indigenous allies. It does so by bringing attention to their culture, struggles, and identities as well as advocating for changes in policy areas relating to the environment, governance, and socio-economic matters. Our study explores to what extent references to aspects of Indigenous identities and culture shaped INM-related tweeting and, by extension, activism during the summer of 2013. We conducted a quantitative and qualitative content analysis of 1650 #IdleNoMore tweets shared by supporters of this movement between 3 July 2013 and 2 August 2013. Our study demonstrates that unlike other social media-intensive movements where economic and political concerns were the primary drivers of political and civil engagement, aspects of Indigenous culture influenced information flows and mobilization among #IdleNoMore tweeters.","[Raynauld, Vincent] Emerson Coll, Dept Commun Studies, 120 Boylston St, Boston, MA 02116 USA; [Richez, Emmanuelle] Univ Windsor, Dept Polit Sci, Windsor, ON, Canada; [Morris, Katie Boudreau] Carleton Univ, Dept Sociol & Anthropol, Ottawa, ON, Canada",,"Raynauld, V (corresponding author), Emerson Coll, Dept Commun Studies, 120 Boylston St, Boston, MA 02116 USA.",vincent_raynauld@emerson.edu; emmanuelle.richez@uwindsor.ca; katie.boudreaumorris@carleton.ca,"Raynauld, Vincent/AAU-5649-2020","Raynauld, Vincent/0000-0002-9814-6707","Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC); Emerson College, Department of Communication Studies; University of Windsor","Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)); Emerson College, Department of Communication Studies; University of Windsor","The authors would like to acknowledge the invaluable financial support of the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC) through an Insight Development Grant for the production of this article.

This study seeks to understand what types of images generate more engagement from social media audiences. A group of communication scholars argue that narrative is the most basic form of human communication and therefore messages with strong narrative themes more easily connect the message from the communicator to the audience. This study performed a content analysis of nearly 2000 images shared by Sports Networks on Instagram. Operating under Kress and van Leeuwen's (Kress, G. R., & van Leeuwen, L. T. (2006).

In so doing, it first sets up a theoretical framework by synthesizing cognitive capitalism and cultural political economy. Cultural political economy helps analyze critically the role financial communication plays in serving the interests of cognitive capitalism, the use of unremunerated immaterial labor to rescue the stationary capitalist accumulation regime. Then, a critical discourse analysis of social media IPOs, as a form of financial communication, aims to unravel how social media companies appropriate such notions as economic growth, innovation, connectivity, and community to advance their financial interests. Findings reveal that IPO statements deploy social media as an autonomous agent of economic growth and a virtuous venue for self-expression and community building, while at the same time effectively concealing the dual foundations of the social media economy, the wide use of free labor and the extraction of value via user data.","[Nam, Siho] Univ N Florida, Dept Commun, Jacksonville, FL USA; [Nam, Siho] Dept Commun, CONTACT, 1 UNF Dr, 14D, Jacksonville, FL USA",,"Nam, S (corresponding author), Univ N Florida, Dept Commun, Jacksonville, FL USA.;Nam, S (corresponding author), Dept Commun, CONTACT, 1 UNF Dr, 14D, Jacksonville, FL USA.",snam@unf.edu,,,,,,,53,3,3,5,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

Using a content analysis of Sina Weibo data of 95 NPO accounts, results suggested that an NPO's status on Weibo is a significant predictor of its follower number. Follower numbers and activeness directly affected the NPO's number of retweets. Informative posts and posts that fulfill multiple gratifications were found to be more sharable than other post types. In addition, a post's originality, media richness, inclusion of opinion leaders, and endorsement by influential users all contributed to its level of circulation. This knowledge is essential for NPOs to spread information and build online communities that facilitate dialogic engagement and quality organization-public relationships with their stakeholders on social media in China's context.","[Chen, Yi-Ru Regina] Hong Kong Baptist Univ, Dept Commun Studies, Commun & Visual Arts Bldg,5 Hereford Rd, Kowloon 8523, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Fu, Jiawei Sophia] Northwestern Univ, Dept Commun Studies, 2240 Campus Dr,Frances Searle Bldg, Evanston, IL 60208 USA",,"Chen, YRR (corresponding author), Hong Kong Baptist Univ, Dept Commun Studies, Commun & Visual Arts Bldg,5 Hereford Rd, Kowloon 8523, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",yrchen@hkbu.edu.hk; sophiafu@u.northwestern.edu,,,,,,,38,17,17,8,100,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

In this study we focus on how two important dimensions of the social media messages of politicians impact different types of user engagement: the distinction between political and private posts and the degree of emotionality of the post. Additionally, we compare the amount and types of interaction between routine periods and election periods. Supported by automatic data gathering and coding we analyze all Facebook posts of 124 Belgian politicians for a period of more than two years (N = 34,408). Our results indicate that different types of Facebook posts lead to different types of user engagement. Private posts generate more reactions, while political posts are more often shared and commented on. Additionally, Facebook posts with positive, and, negative emotional language garner more interaction than those with less emotionality. Finally, during election campaigns both politicians and citizens are more active. There is a proliferation of the amount of Facebook messages that politicians post, and these messages also score higher on engagement.","[Peeters, Jeroen] Univ Antwerp, Lange Nieuwstr 55, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium; [Peeters, Jeroen; Van Aelst, Peter] Res Grp Media Movements & Polit, Antwerp, Belgium; [Opgenhaffen, Michael] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Inst Media Studies, Digital News & Journalism, Leuven, Belgium; [Kreutz, Tim] Univ Antwerp, Computat Linguist Res Grp CLiPS, Antwerp, Belgium; [Van Aelst, Peter] Univ Antwerp, Polit Commun, Antwerp, Belgium",,"Peeters, J (corresponding author), Univ Antwerp, Lange Nieuwstr 55, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium.",Jeroen.peeters4@uantwerpen.be,"van aelst, peter/E-2285-2019","van aelst, peter/0000-0002-2548-0309",BOF GOA,BOF GOA,This work was supported by the BOF GOA,,57,0,0,6,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1933-1681,1933-169X,,J INF TECHNOL POLITI,J.

However, such software also raises questions about accountability as social media is algorithmically filtered for use by journalists and others. Our analysis of the inputs SocialSensor relies on shows biases towards those who are vocal and have an audience, many of whom are men in the media. We also reveal some of the technology's temporal and topic preferences. The conclusion discusses whether such biases are necessary for systems like SocialSensor to be effective.

But during the 2016 US presidential election, social media platforms emerged as a breeding ground for influence campaigns, conspiracy, and alternative media. Anecdotally, the nature of political news and information evolved over time, but political communication researchers have yet to develop a comprehensive, grounded, internally consistent typology of the types of sources shared. Rather than chasing a definition of what is popularly known as fake news, we produce a grounded typology of what users actually shared and apply rigorous coding and content analysis to define the phenomenon. To understand what social media users are sharing, we analyzed large volumes of political conversations that took place on Twitter during the 2016 presidential campaign and the 2018 State of the Union address in the United States. We developed the concept of junk news, which refers to sources that deliberately publish misleading, deceptive, or incorrect information packaged as real news. First, we found a 1:1 ratio of junk news to professionally produced news and information shared by users during the US election in 2016, a ratio that had improved by the State of the Union address in 2018. Second, we discovered that amplifier accounts drove a consistently higher proportion of political communication during the presidential election but accounted for only marginal quantities of traffic during the State of the Union address. Finally, we found that some of the most important units of analysis for general political theory-parties, the state, and policy experts-generated only a fraction of the political communication.","[Bradshaw, Samantha] Ctr Int Governance Innovat, Waterloo, ON, Canada; [Howard, Philip N.] Univ Oxford, Oxford Internet Inst, Internet Studies, Oxford, England; [Howard, Philip N.] Univ Oxford, Balliol Coll, Oxford, England; [Kollanyi, Bence] Corvinus Univ Budapest, Sociol, Budapest, Hungary; [Neudert, Lisa-Maria] Oxford Internet Inst, 1 St Giles, Oxford OX1 3LW, England",,"Neudert, LM (corresponding author), Oxford Internet Inst, 1 St Giles, Oxford OX1 3LW, England.",lisa-maria.neudert@oii.ox.ac.uk,,,European Research Council through the grant: Computational Propaganda: Investigating the Impact of Algorithms and Bots on Political Discourse in Europe [648311]; Ford Foundation [0170-0774]; Hewlett Foundation [2018-7384],European Research Council through the grant: Computational Propaganda: Investigating the Impact of Algorithms and Bots on Political Discourse in Europe; Ford Foundation; Hewlett Foundation,"This research was funded by the European Research Council through the grant: Computational Propaganda: Investigating the Impact of Algorithms and Bots on Political Discourse in Europe, Proposal 648311, 2015-2020, Philip N.

The embedding of social media platforms into peoples' daily routines has blurred the boundaries between work and non-work domains. This presents a host of ethical, legal, and moral challenges pitting the rights and interests of employees against the authority and power of employers. In seeking to investigate whether, and the extent to which, employees' off-duty expression is becoming subject to increasing employer control we conducted a systematic content analysis of Canadian judicial opinions from some 50 arbitration and court decisions involving the porous boundary between employees' off-duty and work lives. The findings offer insights into the governance trajectory being charted by jurisdictional expressions in Canada that deal with reconciling employees' right to freedom of expression with their contractual obligation to avoid harming employers' public reputation. The analysis shows that employers are seeking to impose strong disciplinary measures for employee off-duty social media postings they deem contrary to their interests, and that adjudicators are upholding the imposing of such discipline while mitigating employer disciplinary excesses. These observations suggest the classic dichotomy between owners' time and own time is being reconfigured into a distinction between owners' time/space and one's own tethered time/space. The recent introduction of 'right to disconnect' legislation offers labour unions a unique opportunity to develop collective bargaining proposals aimed at eliminating the tethering of employees' time/space and better protecting their off-duty expression.","[Pare, Daniel J.] Univ Ottawa, Dept Commun, 55 Laurier Ave East, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada; [Smith, Charles] Univ Saskatchewan, St Thomas Moore Coll, Dept Polit Sci, Saskatoon, SK, Canada",,"Pare, DJ (corresponding author), Univ Ottawa, Dept Commun, 55 Laurier Ave East, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada.",daniel.pare@uottawa.ca; csmith@stmcollege.ca,,,"Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council, Canada [430-2018-00880]","Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council, Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC))","This work was supported by an Insight Development Grant from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council, Canada [grant number 430-2018-00880].",,80,0,0,0,0,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

Although all substantive results depend on this choice, researchers usually pick keywords in ad hoc ways that are far from optimal and usually biased. Most seem to think that keyword selection is easy, since they do Google searches every day, but we demonstrate that humans perform exceedingly poorly at this basic task. We offer a better approach, one that also can help with following conversations where participants rapidly innovate language to evade authorities, seek political advantage, or express creativity; generic web searching; eDiscovery; look-alike modeling; industry and intelligence analysis; and sentiment and topic analysis. We develop a computer-assisted (as opposed to fully automated or human-only) statistical approach that suggests keywords from available text without needing structured data as inputs. This framing poses the statistical problem in a new way, which leads to a widely applicable algorithm. Our specific approach is based on training classifiers, extracting information from (rather than correcting) their mistakes, and summarizing results with easy-to-understand Boolean search strings.

However, the relatively easy availability of data collected via platform application programming interfaces has arguably led to the predominance of single-platform research of social media. Such research has also privileged the role of text in social media analysis, as a form of data that is more readily gathered and searchable than images. In this paper, we challenge both of these prevailing forms of social media research by outlining a methodology for visual cross-platform analysis (VCPA), defined as the study of still and moving images across two or more social media platforms. Our argument contains three steps. First, we argue that cross-platform analysis addresses a gap in research methods in that it acknowledges the interplay between a social phenomenon under investigation and the medium within which it is being researched, thus illuminating the different affordances and cultures of web platforms. Second, we build on the literature on multimodal communication and platform vernacular to provide a rationale for incorporating the visual into cross-platform analysis. Third, we reflect on an experimental cross-platform analysis of images within social media posts (n = 471,033) used to communicate climate change to advance different modes of macro- and meso-levels of analysis that are natively visual: image-text networks, image plots and composite images.

The current Chinese administration considers social media the main battlefield for public opinion struggle' between the official discourse and those challenging it. To provide clues about who is shaping the public opinion, this study examined how consuming news from competing information sources on social media influences Chinese citizens' satisfaction with the central and local government. Based on a nationally representative survey of 2,882 Chinese adults, the study found that consuming news from governmental sources on the country's major social media platforms - Weibo and WeChat - was positively associated with citizens' satisfaction with the central government, while exposure to alternative news sources on WeChat had a negative impact on both central and local government satisfaction. Additionally, news consumption from mainstream media sources on social media did not significantly influence the public's government satisfaction. This paper contributes to the current literature by revealing that social media do not provide a unified agenda and by emphasizing the impact of platform affordances on people's political attitudes.","[Zhang, Yiyan; Guo, Lei] Boston Univ, Emerging Media Studies, Boston, MA 02215 USA",,"Zhang, YY (corresponding author), Boston Univ, Emerging Media Studies, Boston, MA 02215 USA.",yiyan411@bu.edu,"Zhang, Yiyan/AAD-8435-2021","Zhang, Yiyan/0000-0003-4299-0236",,,,,73,5,5,8,60,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

By promoting their personal agenda, politicians increasingly profile themselves independent from their associated parties on the web (i.e., self-personalization). By focusing on self-personalization as a multi-layered concept (i.e., professional, emotional, private self-personalization), this study investigates both the use and consequences of self-personalization on Facebook. A manual content analysis of politicians' Facebook posts (N = 435) reveals that self-personalization is indeed often used as a communication style on Facebook and is most often present in visual communication. Moreover, the study shows that the use of a more emotional and private style provides a beneficial tool for politicians' impression management. Publishing emotional and private content yields positive effects on audience engagement, suggesting audiences' demand for more intimate and emotional impressions of public figures on the web.","[Metz, Manon] Mannheim Ctr European Social Res, D-68159 Mannheim, Germany; [Kruikemeier, Sanne] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Sch Commun Res, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Lecheler, Sophie] Univ Vienna, Dept Commun, Polit Commun, Vienna, Austria",,"Metz, M (corresponding author), Mannheim Ctr European Social Res, D-68159 Mannheim, Germany.",manon.metz@mzes.uni-mannheim.de,,"Lecheler, Sophie/0000-0001-7320-1012; Kruikemeier, Sanne/0000-0002-8053-8200",,,,,75,33,33,6,52,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

How the integration of UGC into newswork helps and hinders the role of the journalist,DIGITAL JOURNALISM,,,English,Article,,,,,,BBC; journalism; news; social media; user-generated content (UGC),,"Social media and citizen journalism have arguably changed the face of traditional newsgathering. This paper examines how social media and user-generated content (UGC), specifically video, have been integrated by BBC World News into their coverage of conflicts, with Syria as the main case study. Drawing on interviews with BBC News staff, a newsroom ethnography and a content analysis of BBC World News TV reports, this research asks: What are the challenges for journalists wishing to use UGC? What are the skillsets needed? And is the role of the journalist itself changing, with news becoming more social as it is being gathered and disseminated on platforms such as Facebook and Twitter? This paper argues that journalists have been forced to react to issues pertaining to UGC newsgathering, verification and dissemination. The study contributes to literature examining how UGC is used by news outlets. It also considers the extent to which the role of the journalist itself is being redefined as new products are launched. The findings illustrate that UGC has, at times, been used extensively to cover events in Syria, but ideally complements journalists' own reportage. The research also highlights the crucial role played by journalists, harvesting and checking content found online.","[Johnston, Lisette] City Univ London, Dept Journalism, London, England",,"Johnston, L (corresponding author), City Univ London, Dept Journalism, London, England.",lisettejohnston@yahoo.com,,,,,,,25,16,17,4,41,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

Studies from the Global North have examined children and social media from several perspectives, with discourse now veering towards a rights-based approach to foreground young people's voices in a digital and social media world, something that is missing in countries like India. This paper drew on deep interactions with young people from a large Indian city to gain preliminary insights into social media practices and modes of engagement with particular reference to management of access, privacy, safety, and negotiating challenges or problem solving. Our study suggests that conversations about digital platforms, particularly social media spaces, in relation to children's everyday life practices need to begin early, at the point when children begin interacting with these technologies. Critical digital literacy must recognize the agency of young people, their naturalized interactions with the digital world, as well as the complexities of family and school life that moderate such interactions. These contextual nuances become significant when framing regulatory policies, parental advisories and critical digital literacy and media education programs. This article adds to the slowly growing literature from the Global South that enhances and diversifies our understanding of how the 'born digital' generation lives with/in social media.","[Sarwatay, Devina; Raman, Usha] Univ Hyderabad, Sarojini Naidu Sch Arts & Commun, Dept Commun, Prof CR Rao Rd, Hyderabad 500046, India",,"Sarwatay, D (corresponding author), Univ Hyderabad, Sarojini Naidu Sch Arts & Commun, Dept Commun, Prof CR Rao Rd, Hyderabad 500046, India.",devina.sarwatay@gmail.com; usharaman@uohyd.ac.in,"; Sarwatay, Devina/E-7265-2015","Raman, Usha/0000-0002-9023-9853; Sarwatay, Devina/0000-0003-3453-5786",,,,,43,0,0,5,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

News on social media is 'selected' by a variety of actors, including the editors and journalists that produce the content, and the algorithms developed by technology companies to make automatic display decisions based on users' past behaviour and the actions of their friends. We analyse how people navigate news on social media, and focus on their perception of the different kinds of news selection involved. The analysis uses a mixed-methods design based on focus group material and survey data from Germany, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Across all four countries, with their different political and media systems, we find (i) that the majority do not understand exactly how the information they receive is filtered by algorithms, but they do not uncritically accept it either, because they are sceptical of all forms of selection. including that performed by editors and journalists, (ii) that approval for algorithmic selection is stronger amongst younger people, and (iii) that those with a high level of interest in 'soft' news topics (and low interest in 'hard' news topics) are more likely to approve of news algorithmically selected on the basis of what their friends have consumed. We argue that the way in which most people navigate news on social media is thus based on a 'generalised scepticism' where people question all kinds of selection.","[Fletcher, Richard; Nielsen, Rasmus Kleis] Univ Oxford, Reuters Inst Study Journalism, Dept Polit & Int Relat, 13 Norham Gardens, Oxford OX2 6PS, England",,"Fletcher, R (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Reuters Inst Study Journalism, Dept Polit & Int Relat, 13 Norham Gardens, Oxford OX2 6PS, England.",richard.fletcher@politics.ox.ac.uk,"Fletcher, Richard/V-4402-2019","Fletcher, Richard/0000-0002-5496-2112",Google [CTR00220]; Digital News Report [CTR00150],Google(Google Incorporated); Digital News Report,This work was supported by Google: [Grant Number CTR00220]; Digital News Report: [Grant Number CTR00150].,,42,35,35,11,34,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

In addition, in-depth interviews with key Indonesian journalists, social media activists and media scholars were conducted to examine the issue. The results of this study suggest that diffusion of the movements' messages into the public sphere, along with the politicians' supportive resonance towards the cases, were the main factors influencing the success of these two movements. Importantly, this article argues that while the most important role in this process was played by the vast and positive mainstream media coverage of the cases, social media also played a key role given they initiated the movement discourse and directed it towards mainstream media.","Univ Sydney, Dept Media & Commun, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia",,"Molaei, H (corresponding author), Univ Sydney, Dept Media & Commun, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",hamideh.molaei@gmail.com,"Molaei, Hamideh/J-2715-2018",,,,,,75,14,15,0,56,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

Understanding social media logic.

London: Sage.]. This article explores how social media logic' impacts on two interconnected but yet distinct professions, journalism and politics, by analysing one of the key principles of social media logics, namely connectivity', an advanced strategy of algorithmically connecting users to content and other users in social media [van Dijck, J., & Poell, T.(2013). Understanding social media logic. Media and Communication, 1, 2-14. doi:10.12924/mac2013.01010002].

Twitter hashtags from ad hoc to calculated publics. In N.Rambukkana (Ed.), Hashtag publics: The power and politics of discursive networks (pp.13-27). NewYork, NY: Peter Lang.]. The empirical material consists of tweets posted by 10 Norwegian politicians and 10 journalists, selected on their level of activity on Twitter. The tweets are analysed with the emphasis on the frequency and content of the hashtags, and the methodological design is comparative between the journalists and the politicians. A key finding is that there are significant differences between how journalists and politicians use hashtags, but that they both use mass media hashtags to reach outside their follower networks. Consequently, this demonstrates that journalists' and politicians' use of social media is closely connected to their professional norms, and that the social media logic' is still related to the media logic' of mainstream and broadcast media.","[Enli, Gunn] Univ Oslo, Dept Media & Commun, Oslo, Norway; [Simonsen, Chris-Adrian] Univ Oslo, Dept Media & Commun, Project Social Media & Election Campaigns, Oslo, Norway",,"Enli, G (corresponding author), Univ Oslo, Dept Media & Commun, Oslo, Norway.",gunn.enli@media.uio.no; c.a.simonsen@media.uio.no,,,,,,,63,35,36,4,29,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

These platforms nevertheless have the potential to facilitate informal learning about the color blind racism through which whites rationalize the inequalities and injustices experienced by People of Color (PoC). This paper adds to the emergent literature in this area by exploring a high-profile Twitterstorm in February 2018 following a tweet from Cambridge University Professor Mary Beard about the sexual misconduct of Oxfam aid workers in Haiti. Academics like Dr Priya Gopal faced much criticism for suggesting the tweet was evidence of the white fragility and privilege to which they were frequently subjected. A qualitative content analysis of 1718 unique tweets containing 'Mary Beard', posted between 16 and 20 February 2018, was conducted to assess whether there was much evidence of agonistic debate between critics and supporters of Beard about whiteness. Results indicate that there were twice as many tweets criticizing Beard for her performative white privilege and frailty than those defending her. While the framing of the Twitterstorm was generally agonistic, there was little evidence of informal learning, with PoC conspicuously under-represented. Indeed, the burden of talking about racism and whiteness fell on the few PoC in the corpus, in much the same way as the 'pre-social media' era.","[Ashwell, Ceri] Univ Sheffield, Affiliated Informat Sch, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England; [Reilly, Paul] Univ Glasgow, Sch Social & Polit Sci, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland",,"Reilly, P (corresponding author), Univ Glasgow, Sch Social & Polit Sci, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland.",Paul.Reilly@glasgow.ac.uk,"Reilly, Paul J/P-3803-2016","Reilly, Paul J/0000-0002-6890-778X; Ashwell, Ceri/0000-0002-2806-9611",University of Sheffield,University of Sheffield,This work was supported by University of Sheffield.,,64,0,0,2,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

Using social network analysis, I map their relationship to a broader network of far-right actors in Australia on Facebook and Twitter, identifying pathways of communication, mobilisation and recruitment. The structure of the parties' networks points to highly centralised, leader-centric organisations, placing them in a vulnerable position in terms of sustainability. This is combined with qualitative content analysis, which finds little evidence of party organisation or campaign mobilisation on either platform, despite the context of a first-order election. Instead, these parties use social media primarily for the construction of collective identities and the development and dissemination of interpretive frames, practices typically associated with social movements rather than political parties.","[McSwiney, Jordan] Univ Sydney, Dept Govt & Int Relat, Sydney, NSW, Australia",,"McSwiney, J (corresponding author), Univ Sydney, Dept Govt & Int Relat, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",jordan.mcswiney@sydney.edu.au,,"McSwiney, Jordan/0000-0003-4317-8012",Australian National University,Australian National University(Australian National University),This work was supported by the Australian National University's Herbert and Valmae Frielich Project early career research small grants scheme.,,54,8,8,3,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

An F3 tornado that impacted the community of Goderich, Ontario, on 21 August 2011 provided the opportunity to examine how people utilized Facebook and Facebook groups to seek out information, self-organize, and provide support. This mixed-methods project was conducted in two phases. First, semi-structured interviews (n=35) were conducted with Goderich area residents on their experiences using social media after the tornado. Next, all of the publicly available posts and replies on the Goderich Ontario Tornado Victims and Support (GOTVS) Facebook group were gathered and analysed using computer-assisted content analysis. The results demonstrate that Facebook was a highly influential source of information and support, particularly in the immediate aftermath of the disaster. Although misinformation and gossip occurred, the tendency was for the group to self-moderate inaccurate information. Public engagement by local officials may further reduce misinformation and encourage public confidence. The results also show that GOTVS activity significantly declined after two weeks. This abrupt decrease in public attention suggests that the window for engagement by public officials is narrow. As such, officials should have a social media plan in place so that they may engage with the public during the critical response phase when their participation may yield the greatest benefit. Finally, this research underscores the potential for analysing Facebook content using computer-assisted content analysis, a method that may be of interest across the social sciences.","[Silver, Amber; Matthews, Lindsay] Univ Waterloo, Dept Geog & Environm Management, 200 Univ Ave W, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada",,"Silver, A (corresponding author), Univ Waterloo, Dept Geog & Environm Management, 200 Univ Ave W, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada.",a2silver@uwaterloo.ca; l2matthe@uwaterloo.ca,,,,,,,46,34,35,7,174,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

Here, we provide a guide to help researchers navigate the consequential decisions they need to make before any measure can be produced from the text. We consider, both theoretically and empirically, the effects of such choices using as a running example efforts to measure the tone of New York Times coverage of the economy. We show that two reasonable approaches to corpus selection yield radically different corpora and we advocate for the use of keyword searches rather than predefined subject categories provided by news archives. We demonstrate the benefits of coding using article segments instead of sentences as units of analysis. We show that, given a fixed number of codings, it is better to increase the number of unique documents coded rather than the number of coders for each document. Finally, we find that supervised machine learning algorithms outperform dictionaries on a number of criteria. Overall, we intend this guide to serve as a reminder to analysts that thoughtfulness and human validation are key to text-as-data methods, particularly in an age when it is all too easy to computationally classify texts without attending to the methodological choices therein.","[Barbera, Pablo] Univ Southern Calif, Polit Sci & Int Relat, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA; [Boydstun, Amber E.] Univ Calif Davis, Polit Sci, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Linn, Suzanna] Penn State Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Polit Sci, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [McMahon, Ryan] Penn State Univ, Dept Polit Sci, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [McMahon, Ryan] Google, Mountain View, CA 94043 USA; [Nagler, Jonathan] NYU, Polit, New York, NY 10012 USA; [Nagler, Jonathan] NYU, Ctr Social Media & Polit, New York, NY 10012 USA",,"Barbera, P (corresponding author), Univ Southern Calif, Polit Sci & Int Relat, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA.",pbarbera@usc.edu; aboydstun@ucdavis.edu; sld8@psu.edu; mcmahon.rb@gmail.com; jonathan.nagler@nyu.edu,"Linn, Suzanna/GLS-8909-2022","Linn, Suzanna/0000-0001-7758-4137; Barbera, Pablo/0000-0002-9063-4829",National Science Foundation under IGERT [DGE-1144860]; Big Data Social Science; Moore Foundation; Sloan Foundation; National Science Foundation [SES-1248077],National Science Foundation under IGERT(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Big Data Social Science; Moore Foundation(Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation); Sloan Foundation(Alfred P.

Using two complementary methods - a representative, post-election survey of the adult Czech population and a content analysis of communication on the selected Czech political parties' Facebook profiles during the campaign for the 2013 Parliamentary Elections - we attempt to challenge some established assumptions regarding the allegedly equalizing effect of the Internet and social media on participatory behaviour of men and women. While survey data discovered subtle yet statistically significant differences between men and women in some online expressive activities on Facebook, mainly commenting on other users' statuses, content analysis further revealed that there are not only notable gender gaps among the Facebook users who commented on the campaign, but also differences in the tone of communication produced by the respective gender groups, with men posting more negative comments addressed to parties as well as to other Facebook users. We suggest that these results question the prevailing perception about the narrowing of the gender gap' in the online environment and call for a more nuanced methodological approach to different forms of online political expression.","[Vochocova, Lenka; Stetka, Vaclav; Mazak, Jaromir] Charles Univ Prague, Inst Commun Studies, Dept Media Studies, Fac Social Sci, Smetanovo Nabrezi 6, Prague 11000, Czech Republic; [Mazak, Jaromir] Charles Univ Prague, Dept Sociol, Fac Arts, Nam Jana Palacha 1-2, Prague 11638, Czech Republic",,"Vochocova, L (corresponding author), Charles Univ Prague, Inst Commun Studies, Dept Media Studies, Fac Social Sci, Smetanovo Nabrezi 6, Prague 11000, Czech Republic.",lenka.vochocova@fsv.cuni.cz; vaclav.stetka@fsv.cuni.cz; mazak.jaromir@gmail.com,"Stetka, Vaclav/AAF-7361-2019; Vochocova, Lenka/E-9790-2018; Mazák, Jaromír/G-8460-2017; Mazák, Jaromír/K-8379-2019; Stetka, Vaclav/AAR-6858-2021","Mazák, Jaromír/0000-0001-9326-1290; Mazák, Jaromír/0000-0001-9326-1290; Stetka, Vaclav/0000-0001-8381-3645",Czech Science Foundation (GACR) [14-05575S],Czech Science Foundation (GACR)(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic),This research was supported by the Czech Science Foundation (GACR) [Standard Grant Nr 14-05575S] under the topic 'The Role of Social Media in the Transformation of Political Communication and Citizen Participation in the Czech Republic'.,,46,17,17,2,72,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

Searching for diversity-related issues, researchers asked whether diverse groups were represented among the most influential accounts. It also identified the most common topics shared, and whether the shared content represented democratic discussion. Finally, the study looked at how much election-relatedsharing among influencers conformed to a media logic or social media logic framework. Researchers found that Twitter use during the election campaign did not provide a level playing field for political discussion. Instead, data suggested individual celebrity users were more likely to be amplified than others. Despite this, however, it appears that issues that were relevant to diverse groups made it into the Twitter conversation, making up a meaningful portion of tweets related to the election. These findings suggest that if diverse voices were not retweeted, at least issues were still being discussed, and thus contradict the popular idea of online echo chambers on Twitter.","[Hodson, Jaigris] Royal Rd Univ, Coll Interdisciplinary Studies, 2005 Sooke Rd, Victoria, BC, Canada",,"Hodson, J (corresponding author), Royal Rd Univ, Coll Interdisciplinary Studies, 2005 Sooke Rd, Victoria, BC, Canada.",jaigris.hodson@royalroads.ca,"Hodson, Jaigris/AAQ-7096-2021",,Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada,Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),This work was supported by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada [CURA - Diversity Leads].,,68,6,6,1,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1933-1681,1933-169X,,J INF TECHNOL POLITI,J.

I argue that partnerships between academics and industry represent one potential option for improving this situation. While no panacea, such arrangements may be able to contribute to a more rules-based and less anarchic situation in social media research, placing greater emphasis on preserving user privacy and the reproducibility of results, rather thanmainlyon compiling large data sets. Due to a number of recent shifts, not just in research, but in the public discourse surrounding social media platforms and user data, we are entering an era of increased institutionalization and standardization in the study of online communication. This new environment appears poised to replace the Wild West of social media research' that we have witnessed in the past, in which academics compile huge troughs of data with few constraints, not always acting in the public's best interest.","[Puschmann, Cornelius] Hans Bredow Inst, Leibniz Inst Media Res, Hamburg, Germany",,"Puschmann, C (corresponding author), Rothenbaumchaussee 36, D-20148 Hamburg, Germany.",c.puschmann@hans-bredow-institut.de,,"Puschmann, Cornelius/0000-0002-3189-0662",,,,,6,20,20,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

This paper investigates the articulation between sharenting as performed by celebrities and the wider construction of children's digital identities. Through qualitative content analysis, this research looks at how Cristiano Ronaldo, the most-followed individual on Instagram since 2018, his partner, and his mother shared information about his children on that social media platform between 2018 and 2020. Through manual exploration, we searched for Ronaldo's children across a variety of digital spaces. Our analysis reveals that sharenting on Instagram engages audiences through the portrayal of children as the parents' extended self. Content from Instagram and news media is appropriated in vernacular and commercial digital spaces for conflicting affects: the cute father-son dyad, and the son as extension of the uber-famous, vain father. This extreme case shows how the digital identities of children of celebrities are widely public, formed by the everyday, intimate content of the family's life, which is persistent and collectively recreated by news media, vernacular culture, and commercial platforms.","[Jorge, Ana] Lusofona Univ CICANT, ECATI, Lisbon, Portugal; [Maropo, Lidia] Polytech Inst Setubal, Higher Sch Educ, Dept Commun & Language Sci, Setubal, Portugal; [Maropo, Lidia] CICS NOVA, Lisbon, Portugal; [Neto, Filipa] ISCTE IUL, Sociol, Lisbon, Portugal",,"Jorge, A (corresponding author), Lusofona Univ CICANT, ECATI, Lisbon, Portugal.",ana.jorge@ulusofona.pt,"Jorge, Ana/N-2163-2019","Jorge, Ana/0000-0002-4069-6212; Maropo, Lidia/0000-0003-4687-7628",,,,,62,0,0,17,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

This article presents the methods and results of an exploratory study to supplement survey data with respondents' Twitter postings, networks of Twitter friends and followers, and information to which they were exposed about e-cigarettes. Twitter use is important to consider in e-cigarette research and other topics influenced by online information sharing and exposure. Further, Twitter metadata provide direct measures of user's friends and followers as opposed to survey self-reports. We find that Twitter metadata provide similar information to survey questions on Twitter network size without inducing recall error or other measurement issues. Using sentiment coding and machine learning methods, we find Twitter can elucidate on topics difficult to measure via surveys such as online expressed opinions and network composition. We present and discuss models predicting whether respondents' tweet positively about e-cigarettes using survey and Twitter data, finding the combined data to provide broader measures than either source alone.","[Murphy, Joe] RTI Int, Survey Res Div, Chicago, IL USA; [Hsieh, Y.

With the power of these platforms to expose citizens to political information, the implications for democracy are profound, making understanding what is shared during elections a priority on the research agenda. Nevertheless, to the best of our knowledge, no study has yet explicitly explored how elections transform news sharing behaviour on Facebook. This study begins to remedy this by (a) investigating changes in news coverage and news sharing behaviour on Facebook by comparing election and routine periods, and by (b) addressing the 'news gap' between preferences of journalists and news consumers on social media. Employing a novel data set of news articles (N = 83,054) in Mexico, findings show that during periods of heightened political activity, both the publication and dissemination of political news increases, the gap between the news choices of journalists and consumers narrows, and that news sharing resembles a zero-sum game, with increased political news sharing leading to a decrease in the sharing of other news.","[de Leon, Ernesto] Univ Bern, Inst Commun & Media Studies, Fabrikstr 8,Off 125, Bern, Switzerland; [Vermeer, Susan; Trilling, Damian] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Sch Commun Res, Amsterdam, Netherlands",,"Trilling, D (corresponding author), Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Sch Commun Res, Dept Commun Sci, Postbus 15791, NL-1001 NG Amsterdam, Netherlands.",ernesto.deleon@ikmb.unibe.ch; s.a.m.vermeer@uva.nl; d.c.trilling@uva.nl,,"Trilling, Damian/0000-0002-2586-0352; de Leon, Ernesto/0000-0003-3152-0722",,,,,52,1,1,7,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

Protest groups, predominantly organized along ethnic identification, have used social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter to disseminate strategies, recruit members, and galvanize support. Anchored on theories of collective identity and moral outrage, this study investigates the role of social media platforms in mobilizing Ethiopians toward political reform during the protest and post-protest periods demarcated by the ascent of Abiy Ahmed as the new Prime Minister of Ethiopia. Data generated from a mixed method approach consisting of an online survey and interviews indicate social media platforms played a crucial role by drawing Ethiopian youth to participate in political discourse, empowering formerly marginalized groups to influence policy, and fostering ingroup cultural/political cohesion. However, evidence indicates participation opportunities created by social media platforms also brought apprehension including the rise of outrage communication as manifested by inflammatory expressions, hate speech, and political extremism. By proposingoutrage communicationas a viable construct that captures this phenomenon, I argue, in the context of a polity embodying highly heterogeneous and competing collective identities - ethnic or otherwise - such as Ethiopia, social media platforms are likely to increase ingroup political participation but chronically diminish outgroup engagement.","[Workneh, Tewodros W.] Kent State Univ, Sch Commun Studies, 163 Taylor Hall,300 Midway Dr,POB 5190, Kent, OH 44242 USA",,"Workneh, TW (corresponding author), Kent State Univ, Sch Commun Studies, 163 Taylor Hall,300 Midway Dr,POB 5190, Kent, OH 44242 USA.",tworkneh@kent.edu,"Workneh, Tewodros/AAR-4224-2021","Workneh, Tewodros/0000-0001-8301-2696",,,,,33,5,5,1,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

While machine learning approaches usually perform better, they offer little insight into (a) which of the assumptions underlying dictionary approaches (bag-of-words, domain transferability, or additivity) impedes performance most, and (b) which language features drive the algorithmic classification most strongly. To fill both gaps, we offer a systematic assumption-based error analysis, using the integrative complexity of social media comments as our case in point. We show that attacking the additivity assumption offers the strongest potential for improving dictionary performance. We also propose to combine off-the-shelf dictionaries with supervised glass box machine learning algorithms (as opposed to the usual black box machine learning approaches) to classify texts and learn about the most important features for classification. This dictionary-plus-supervised-learning approach performs similarly well as classic full-text machine learning or deep learning approaches, but yields interpretable results in addition, which can inform theory development on top of enabling a valid classification.","[Dobbrick, Timo; Jakob, Julia; Chan, Chung-Hong] Univ Mannheim, Mannheim Ctr European Social Res, Mannheim, Germany; [Wessler, Hartmut] Univ Mannheim, Inst Media & Commun Studies, Mannheim, Germany",,"Dobbrick, T (corresponding author), Mannheimer Zentrum Europaische Sozialforsch MZES, A 5,6,A Raum 215, D-68159 Mannheim, Germany.",Timo.Dobbrick@mzes.uni-mannheim.de,"; Chan, Chung-hong/D-6946-2013","Wessler, Hartmut/0000-0003-4216-5471; Dobbrick, Timo/0000-0002-6252-1157; Chan, Chung-hong/0000-0002-6232-7530; Jakob, Julia/0000-0003-2340-5193",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [260291564],Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft(German Research Foundation (DFG)),This work was supported by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [260291564].,,49,1,1,1,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1931-2458,1931-2466,,COMMUN METHODS MEAS,Commun.

We conducted a series of open-ended, in-depth qualitative interviews with campaign professionals active during the 2016 presidential cycle. Our analysis revealed that scholars need to account for the ways that campaigns perceive their candidates in addition to the audiences, affordances, and genres of different social media platforms, as well as the timing of the electoral cycle, in order to effectively study strategic social media communication. Our findings reveal that campaigns proceed from perceptions of their candidates' public personae and comfort with engagement on social media. Campaigns perceive that social media platforms vary according to their audiences, including their demographics and other characteristics; with respect to their affordances, actual and perceived functionalities; the genres of communication perceived to be appropriate to them; and the timing of the electoral cycle, which shapes messaging strategies and the utility of particular platforms. These factors shape how campaigns use social media in the service of their electoral goals. We conclude by developing these findings into an analytic framework for future research, arguing that researchers should refrain from automatically generalizing the results of single-platform studies to social media as a whole, and detailing the implications of our findings for future political communication research.","[Kreiss, Daniel] Univ N Carolina, Sch Media & Journalism, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Lawrence, Regina G.] Univ Oregon, George S Turnbull Ctr, Eugene, OR 97403 USA; [Lawrence, Regina G.] Univ Oregon, Agora Journalism Ctr, Eugene, OR 97403 USA; [Lawrence, Regina G.] Univ Oregon, Sch Journalism & Commun, Eugene, OR 97403 USA; [McGregor, Shannon C.] Univ Utah, Dept Commun, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA",,"Kreiss, D (corresponding author), Univ N Carolina, Sch Media & Journalism, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA.",,"McGregor, Shannon C/AAO-1718-2020","McGregor, Shannon/0000-0002-3275-0397",Social Media Collective at Microsoft Research,Social Media Collective at Microsoft Research(Microsoft),"The authors wish to thank editor Claes deVreese and guest editors Leticia Bode and Emily Vraga for their guidance on this study, as well as for attending our 8am APSA presentation and suggesting we submit to the special issue.

One notable difference from traditional communication outlets is the easy inclusion of visual elements within social media messaging. One such example of the turn toward the visual in online communication is the fight over the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL), during which environmental groups livestreamed protests and posted images of demonstrators staring down police. This study examines the use and consequences of visual-based 'new media' platforms by applying the Narrative Policy Framework (NPF) to the case of DAPL. The NPF focuses our attention on the role of policy stories, acknowledging that narratives have impacts on policy beliefs and actions. I compare social media messaging that includes imagery to that which does not, exploring creation of policy narratives as defined through the NPF. I do so by drawing on a dataset of more than 580 Twitter posts by five environmental advocacy groups from July 2016 through October 2017. My findings speak to the ways in which images and accompanying text interact to form more robust narratives. Visual tweets are also more likely to stimulate greater sharing behavior.

Based on media logic theory, we argue that the communication style of these messages is likely to be more interpersonal and subjective. To investigate this we used computational text analysis to compare status messages to headlines and leads, covering nine newspapers from the Netherlands and Flanders over a period of 2.5 years.

We begin by outlining the key methodological issues surrounding content analysis as performed by human coders and existing computational algorithms. After reviewing the most popular analytic approaches, we introduce an alternative, hybrid method that is aimed at improving reliability, validity, and efficiency when analyzing social media content. To demonstrate the usefulness of this method, we track nuclear energy- and nanotechnology-related opinion expression on Twitter surrounding the Fukushima Daiichi accident to examine the extent to which the volume and tone of tweets shift in directions consistent with the expected external influence of the event. Our analysis revealed substantial shifts in both the volume and tone of nuclear power-related tweets that were consistent with our expectations following the disaster event. Conversely, there was decidedly more stability in the volume and tone of tweets for our comparison issue. These analyses provide an empirical demonstration of how the presented hybrid method can analyze defined communication sentiment and topics from large-scale social media data sets.

In this paper, we draw upon recent advances in computational text analysis to develop a hybrid approach to the deductive analysis of large-scale digital discourse, which combines the algorithmic extraction of coherent, recurrent patterns with a manual coding of identified patterns. The approach scales up to treat millions of texts at minimal added human effort, while affording researchers close control over the process of theory-guided classification.

Using the 2016-2017 protests of the Dakota Access Pipeline by the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and allies, we examine how social media (Facebook, YouTube, Twitter) influenced public attention to the NoDAPL protests, demonstrating that engagement with social media has effects independent of traditional forms of media coverage.","[Hunt, Kate] Indiana Univ, Hamilton Lugar Sch Global & Int Studies, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Gruszczynski, Mike] Indiana Univ, Med Sch, Bloomington, IN USA",,"Hunt, K (corresponding author), Indiana Univ, Hamilton Lugar Sch Global & Int Studies, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",huntkate@iu.edu,"Gruszczynski, Mike/I-4951-2019","Gruszczynski, Mike/0000-0003-1037-456X; Hunt, Kate/0000-0001-8031-6678",,,,,67,10,10,8,46,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

The theoretical framework combines Melucci's (1996) theory of collective identity with insights from the field of organizational communication and particularly from the CCO' strand - short for Communication is Constitutive of Organizing'. This allows us to conceptualize collective identity as an open-ended and dynamic process that is constructed in conversations and codified in texts. Based on interviews with Occupy activists in NewYork, London and other cities, I then discuss the communication processes through which the movement was drawing the boundaries with its environment, creating codes and foundational documents, as well as speaking in a collective voice. The findings show that social media tended to blur the boundaries between the inside and the outside of the movement in a way that suited its values of inclusiveness and direct participation. Social media users could also follow remotely the meetings of the general assembly where the foundational documents were ratified, but their voices were not included in the process. The presence of the movement on social media also led to conflicts and negotiations around Occupy's collective voice as constructed on these platforms. Thus, viewing the movement as a phenomenon emerging in communication allows us an insight into the efforts of Occupy activists to create a collective that was both inclusive of the 99% and a distinctive actor with its own identity.","Univ Westminster, Sch Media Arts & Design, Harrow HA1 3TP, Middx, England",,"Kavada, A (corresponding author), Univ Westminster, Sch Media Arts & Design, Harrow Campus,Northwick Pk,Watford Rd, Harrow HA1 3TP, Middx, England.",A.Kavada@westminster.ac.uk,,,British Academy Mid-Career Fellowship [SCHW08]; European Union (European Social Fund - ESF); Greek national funds through the Operational Program 'Education and Lifelong Learning' of the National Strategic Reference Framework (NSRF) - Research Funding Program: ARCHIMEDES III,British Academy Mid-Career Fellowship; European Union (European Social Fund - ESF)(European Social Fund (ESF)); Greek national funds through the Operational Program 'Education and Lifelong Learning' of the National Strategic Reference Framework (NSRF) - Research Funding Program: ARCHIMEDES III,"The fieldwork for this research was funded by a British Academy Mid-Career Fellowship, Award number: SCHW08.

For media professionals generally and journalists especially, branding on spaces such as Twitter reveals the complicated set of forces confronting such public-facing actors as they navigate tensions between personal disclosure for authenticity and professional decorum for credibility, and between establishing one's own distinctiveness and promoting one's employer or other stakeholders. While studies have begun to reveal what journalists say about branding, they have yet to provide a broad profile of what they do. This study takes up that challenge through a content analysis of the Twitter profiles and tweets of a representative sample of 384 U.S. journalists. We focus on the extent of branding practices; the levels at which such branding occurs, whether to promote one's self (individual), one's news organization (organizational), or the journalism profession at large (institutional); and how other social media practices may be related to forms of journalistic branding. Results suggest that branding is now widely common among journalists on Twitter; that branding occurs at all three levels but primarily at the individual and organizational levels, with organizational branding taking priority; and that time on Twitter is connected with more personal information being shared.","[Molyneux, Logan] Temple Univ, Journalism, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA; [Holton, Avery] Univ Utah, Dept Commun, Salt Lake City, UT USA; [Lewis, Seth C.] Univ Oregon, Sch Journalism & Commun, Eugene, OR 97403 USA",,"Molyneux, L (corresponding author), Temple Univ, 2020 N 13th St, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA.",logan@temple.edu,"Molyneux, Logan/I-9791-2019; Lewis, Seth/AAM-8847-2020","Molyneux, Logan/0000-0001-7382-3065; Lewis, Seth/0000-0001-7498-0599; Holton, Avery/0000-0003-1307-2890",,,,,53,52,53,6,32,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

It has been well-researched in political manifestos and the mass media. The present study focuses on another part of the hybrid media system and explores how politicians in four countries (AT, CH, IT, UK) use Facebook and Twitter for populist purposes. Five key elements of populism are derived from the literature: emphasizing the sovereignty of the people, advocating for the people, attacking the elite, ostracizing others, and invoking the heartland'. A qualitative text analysis reveals that populism manifests itself in a fragmented form on social media. Populist statements can be found across countries, parties, and politicians' status levels. While a broad range of politicians advocate for the people, attacks on the economic elite are preferred by left-wing populists. Attacks on the media elite and ostracism of others, however, are predominantly conducted by right-wing speakers. Overall, the paper provides an in-depth analysis of populism on social media. It shows that social media give the populist actors the freedom to articulate their ideology and spread their messages. The paper also contributes to a refined conceptualization and measurement of populism in future studies.","[Engesser, Sven; Ernst, Nicole; Esser, Frank; Buechel, Florin] Univ Zurich, Inst Mass Commun & Media Res, Andreasstr 15, CH-8050 Zurich, Switzerland",,"Engesser, S (corresponding author), Univ Zurich, Inst Mass Commun & Media Res, Andreasstr 15, CH-8050 Zurich, Switzerland.",s.engesser@ipmz.uzh.ch; n.ernst@ipmz.uzh.ch; f.esser@ipmz.uzh.ch; f.buechel@ipmz.uzh.ch,"Engesser, Sven/S-6150-2018","Engesser, Sven/0000-0003-1638-7548",National Center of Competence in Research on 'Challenges to Democracy in the 21st Century' (NCCR Democracy); Swiss National Science Foundation,National Center of Competence in Research on 'Challenges to Democracy in the 21st Century' (NCCR Democracy); Swiss National Science Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)European Commission),"This study was supported by the National Center of Competence in Research on 'Challenges to Democracy in the 21st Century' (NCCR Democracy), funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation.",,52,271,275,35,523,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

This paper examines discourses around mobilization vs. demobilization in the context of the municipal elections in Jerusalem. As the sweeping majority of East Jerusalem Palestinians have continuously been boycotting Jerusalem's municipal elections, this is a potent case through which to examine how demobilization functions in action, through social media conversations. Using a mixed-methods analysis of Twitter contents as structured by different languages, our findings show how mobilization and demobilization discourses can co-occur during the same election event. Users of different languages - reflecting different social and political identities - interpret the elections in contrasting ways, with tangible implications for (in)equality in political participation. The study thus contributes theoretically to several domains of political communication, including election studies, local politics, and language fragmentation in online political discourse.","[Kligler-Vilenchik, Neta; de Vries Kedem, Maya] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Commun & Journalism, IL-91905 Jerusalem, Israel; [Maier, Daniel] Free Univ Berlin, Inst Media & Commun Studies, Berlin, Germany; [Stoltenberg, Daniela] Univ Munster, Munster, Germany",,"Kligler-Vilenchik, N (corresponding author), Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Commun & Journalism, IL-91905 Jerusalem, Israel.",neta.kv@mail.huji.ac.il,,"Kligler-Vilenchik, Neta/0000-0003-3470-3305; Stoltenberg, Daniela/0000-0001-9334-1514",,,,,38,2,3,1,16,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1058-4609,1091-7675,,POLIT COMMUN,Polit.

Recently, the debate has shifted towards tech lash with many critics pointing towards technology companies undermining democracy, stability, and sustainability. As a result, a new consensus seems to be emerging among policymakers, companies, and civil societal actors that self-regulation has to move towards co-regulation. This Special Issue of Information, Communication and Society draws together cutting-edge contributions on three core themes in scholarly and policy discourse on platform regulation: First, the papers in this special issue enhance empirical understandings of the role of the state in governing social media platforms developing in the United States, Europe, and Sub-Saharan Africa. Second, they provide a holistic framework to understand policy problems that need to be addressed, which helps to develop and evaluate new policy initiatives. Finally, papers point towards three approaches in governing social media platforms and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of content moderation, process-based co-regulation, as well as competition regulation and alternative business models.","[Stockmann, Daniela] Hertie Sch, Digital Governance, Berlin, Germany",,"Stockmann, D (corresponding author), Hertie Sch, Friedrichstr 180, D-10117 Berlin, Germany.",stockmann@hertie-school.org,,,Center for Digital Governance at the Hertie School; University of Siegen; German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD); Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) [57533410],Center for Digital Governance at the Hertie School; University of Siegen; German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD)(Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD)); Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),"This research received funding from the Center for Digital Governance at the Hertie School, the University of Siegen, and by the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) with funding from the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) (Grant number 57533410).",,59,0,0,4,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

Although resolutions have a long history, the twenty-first century has transformed the practice into a social media ritual with greater visibility, interactivity, and reach. Using this unique event to explore the globalization of values, we analyze tweets about New Year's resolutions in English, German, Italian, Japanese, and Korean. Combining network analysis (n = 160,592) and content analysis (n = 2000), we compare discursive topics, modes of ritual participation, and the values expressed in resolutions. Our findings indicate both that the ritual crosses cultures and that there are language-specific dynamics that do not map neatly onto established divisions between 'Eastern' and 'Western' value orientations. Instead, we identify three underlying tensions organizing the articulation of values: self-acceptance vs. self-improvement, public vs. private, and conformity vs. oppositionality. We discuss these in relation to an overarching tension between local contexts and global platform cultures. Finally, we explore the study's broader implications for understanding the interaction between values, norms, and global communicative practices.","[Hallinan, Blake; Kim, Bumsoo; Mizoroki, Saki; Scharlach, Rebecca; Trillo, Tommaso; Shifman, Limor] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Commun & Journalism, Jerusalem, Israel; [Mizoroki, Saki] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Interdisciplinary Informat Studies, Tokyo, Japan; [Thelwall, Mike] Univ Wolverhampton, Sch Math & Comp, Wolverhampton, England; [Segev, Elad] Tel Aviv Univ, Dept Commun, Tel Aviv, Israel; [Kim, Bumsoo] Joongbu Univ, Dept Media & Commun, Goyang Si, South Korea",,"Hallinan, B (corresponding author), Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Commun & Journalism, Jerusalem, Israel.",blake.hallinan@mail.huji.ac.il,"Kim, Bumsoo/ABK-1577-2022; Thelwall, Mike/C-1449-2013","Thelwall, Mike/0000-0001-6065-205X; Segev, Elad/0000-0002-3969-8253; Shifman, Limor/0000-0002-2616-9491; Hallinan, Blake/0000-0002-4696-8290",European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme [819004],European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme(European Research Council (ERC)),This project has received funding from the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme [grant agreement No 819004].,,65,0,0,9,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

Studying the journalist-politician relationship in Slovenia through Twitter conversations,DIGITAL JOURNALISM,,,English,Article,,,,,,content analysis; interviews; journalists; politicians; social media,MEDIA; PROFESSIONALISM,"By reconsidering the complexities of the journalist-politician relationship, the study pursues the metaphor of tango introduced by Herbert J. Gans and analyses the online interplay in Twitter conversations between journalistic and political actors. Various types of conversations emerged through the quantitative analysis of the tweets, which ranged from seeking mutual affection, through monitoring-advocating connections and information sharing to unbridgeable advocacy. According to the interviewed journalistic and political actors, such tweets were shaped by their subjective considerations of boundaries in their Twitter repertoires as the principles of social media networking have not been institutionalized in either Slovenian newsrooms or parties. The results revealed that neither journalists nor politicians led the Twitter tango, but instead whether these actors engaged in Twitter conversations as either initiators or respondents. The identified boundary dynamics of the Twitter tango indicate that social media are a particular venue for the articulation of journalist-politician relationships, which in some cases are shaped by offline relations. The findings imply that in Slovenia contemporary journalism's relation to politics is paradoxical because it is shaped by the liquidity of late-modern social communication and the compactness of an elite culture.","[Vobic, Igor] Univ Ljubljana, Fac Social Sci, Chair Journalism, Ljubljana, Slovenia; [Maksuti, Alem] Inst Polit Management, Ljubljana, Slovenia; [Dezelan, Tomaz] Univ Ljubljana, Fac Social Sci, Dept Polit Sci, Ljubljana, Slovenia",,"Vobic, I (corresponding author), Univ Ljubljana, Fac Social Sci, Chair Journalism, Ljubljana, Slovenia.",igor.vobic@fdv.uni-lj.si; alem.maksuti@ipm.si; tomaz.dezelan@fdv.uni-lj.si,,"Dezelan, Tomaz/0000-0002-1625-2558",,,,,45,3,3,1,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

In the case of elections, Twitter has been used actively by candidates and voters alike in a diverse range of elections around the world including the 2010 UK elections, the 2012 US presidential elections, and the 2013 Italian elections. However, Twitter has often been found to be a poor predictor of electoral success. This article investigates what role tweets play during elections and whether they are more reactive than predictive. Using the specific case of the 2012 US Republican presidential primary elections, this article explores how candidate's Twitter presence affects electoral outcomes and whether the sentiment and frequency of candidate-related tweets is related to campaign success and offline success at the ballot box. This study finds that tweets were more reactive rather than predictive. Additionally, sentiment analysis revealed that tweets were generally neutral towards candidates. An interesting finding of our study is how candidates used Twitter to generate 'buzz', political capital that did not translate to success at the ballot box. We specifically explore how Huntsman's daughters used YouTube videos and tweets that were perceived as a 'backstage' look into the campaign and ultimately generated high levels of buzz. Though tweets do not seem to be reflective or predictive of an election campaign offline, they are being used for social media campaigns which can and do get covered by traditional media.","Univ London, Dept Sociol, Goldsmiths, London, England",,"Murthy, D (corresponding author), Univ London, Dept Sociol, Goldsmiths, London, England.",d.murthy@gold.ac.uk,,"Murthy, Dhiraj/0000-0001-9734-1124",,,,,53,33,33,3,95,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

Technology developers have leveraged this language of inspiration to describe how these platforms and applications could fit within, perpetuate, and ultimately direct design labor practice among and within these sites. This empirical study examines the continual shaping and reshaping of the digital inspirational economy, where one designer's creative content becomes another's inspiration. Drawing on interviews with 45 graphic designers, participant observations, and industry texts, I analyze the digital work of designers as they manage dialectical tensions between inspiration and imitation across a design-centric social media landscape. I highlight four key practices designers employed as a part of their shaping and negotiation of the digital inspirational economy including (1) continual investment, (2) ensuring novelty, (3) compulsory comparability, and (4) prioritizing connections. Each of these inspiration practices reveal a unique dialectical tension that designers negotiated as an emerging part of the 'work of inspiration'. The platforms and practices used by enterprising designers illuminate the contours of evolving work practices and the ways in which designers are continually challenged to assert their economic value in the creative economy. As such, analyzing the practice of inspiration illuminates larger issues concerning attribution, diffusion of visual information, and the politics of creative economies. I conclude by addressing the work and self-presentation implications for freelance and independent creative professionals whose work processes are increasingly entangled with digital platforms.","[Scolere, Leah] Colorado State Univ, Dept Design & Merchandising, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA",,"Scolere, L (corresponding author), Colorado State Univ, Dept Design & Merchandising, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA.",leah.scolere@colostate.edu,,,,,,,86,1,1,2,21,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

Campaign use of social media is typically governed by controlled interactivity, a philosophy that attempts to leverage citizens' online behavior toward the goal of electing the candidate. One key outcome of controlled interactivity is high levels of message discipline, the degree of correspondence between a campaign's and its audience's political speech. This study quantifies message discipline as it flows through two highly visible controlled-interactive spaces-Barack Obama's and Mitt Romney's respective official campaign Facebook pages-during the 2012 U.S. presidential campaign. The results of a lexicon analysis indicate that Romney's campaign controlled its audience's interactivity more effectively than the Obama campaign and that both audiences departed from message discipline most sharply on the issues of civil rights and religion.","[Freelon, Deen] Amer Univ, Sch Commun, 4400 Massachusetts Ave NW, Washington, DC 20016 USA",,"Freelon, D (corresponding author), Amer Univ, Sch Commun, 4400 Massachusetts Ave NW, Washington, DC 20016 USA.",freelon@american.edu,"Freelon, Deen/AAV-6040-2020","Freelon, Deen/0000-0001-5055-0316",,,,,55,12,12,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1933-1681,1933-169X,,J INF TECHNOL POLITI,J.

To test the empirical implications of our argument, we construct the most comprehensive corpus of U.S. presidential campaign speeches (1952-2016) and estimate the prevalence of populist rhetoric across these speeches with a novel automated text analysis method utilizing active learning and word embedding.

Our research explores whether groups within a defined issue community - American-Jewish organizations advocating on U.S.-Israel relations - use Twitter for dialog, or whether their Twitter networks represent echo chambers. Based on the results of our social network analysis we find the use of Twitter is more complex than the black-and-white narrative of echo chamber vs. public sphere.

Negative perceptions of justice and police conduct largely originated from within Democratic-leaning communities and areas with larger African American populations.

These ends are examined in tandem in an attempt to surface commonalities in the way that individuals use visual social media when sharing information about other people. A range of emerging norms in digital discourses about birth and death are uncovered, and it is significant that in both cases the individuals being talked about cannot reply for themselves. Issues of agency in representation therefore frame the analysis. After sorting through a number of entry points, images and videos with the #ultrasound and #funeral hashtags were tracked for three months in 2014. Ultrasound images and videos on Instagram revealed a range of communication and representation strategies, most highlighting social experiences and emotional peaks. There are, however, also significant privacy issues as a significant proportion of public accounts share personally identifiable metadata about the mother and unborn child, although these issue are not apparent in relation to funeral images. Unlike other social media platforms, grief on Instagram is found to be more about personal expressions of loss rather than affording spaces of collective commemoration. A range of related practices and themes, such as commerce and humour, were also documented as a part of the spectrum of activity on the Instagram platform. Norms specific to each collection emerged from this analysis, which are then compared to document research about other social media platforms, especially Facebook.","[Leaver, Tama] Curtin Internet Studies, GPO Box U1987, Perth, WA 6845, Australia; [Highfield, Tim] Queensland Univ Technol, Digital Media Res Ctr, Kelvin Grove, Australia",,"Leaver, T (corresponding author), Curtin Internet Studies, GPO Box U1987, Perth, WA 6845, Australia.",t.leaver@curtin.edu.au,"Leaver, Tama/K-2697-2014","Leaver, Tama/0000-0002-4065-4725; Highfield, Tim/0000-0002-1794-146X",,,,,39,39,39,4,46,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

The study builds on an extensive data collection of all Scandinavian news outlets' Facebook posts including their respective websites' article teasers over the course of 11 months. We investigate the use of news text grammar (e.g., punctuation or the use of pronouns) and social media features (e.g., hashtags or the use of emojis) alongside structural influences from individual countries, outlet reach, and ownership. Findings show Facebook posts to include less punctuation while employing more calls to action through the use of question and exclamation marks. We conclude with a reinvigorated call for hierarchical considerations when investigating news outlets' social media endeavours through editors' experiences, available resources to a news outlet, and institutional willingness to align with audiences.","[Haim, Mario] Univ Leipzig, Fac Social Sci & Philosophy, Dept Commun & Media Studies, Leipzig, Germany; [Karlsson, Michael; Ferrer-Conill, Raul] Karlstad Univ, Fac Arts & Social Sci, Dept Geog Media & Commun, Karlstad, Sweden; [Ferrer-Conill, Raul; Sjovaag, Helle] Univ Stavanger, Dept Media & Social Sci, Fac Social Sci, Stavanger, Norway; [Kammer, Aske] Danmarks Medieog Journalisthojskole, Aarhus, Denmark; [Elgesem, Dag] Univ Bergen, Dept Informat Sci & Media Studies, Fac Social Sci, Bergen, Norway",,"Haim, M (corresponding author), Univ Leipzig, Fac Social Sci & Philosophy, Dept Commun & Media Studies, Leipzig, Germany.",mario.haim@uni-leipzig.de,"Ferrer Conill, Raul/G-3347-2014","Ferrer Conill, Raul/0000-0002-0501-2217","Ander Foundation, Anne-Marie och Gustav Anders stiftelse for mediaforskning","Ander Foundation, Anne-Marie och Gustav Anders stiftelse for mediaforskning","The authors would like to thank the anonymous reviewers as well as Marco Bachl for his thoughts on the multilevel analyses.

We find a significant incidence of nationalist sentiments and economic views expressed on Twitter, which persist throughout the campaign and are only offset in the last days when a globalist upsurge brings the British Twittersphere closer to a divide between nationalist and globalist standpoints. Upon combining demographic variables with the classifier scores, we find that the model explains 41% of the variance in the referendum vote, an indication that not only material inequality, but also ideological readjustments have contributed to the outcome of the referendum.

Unfortunately, conversations on social media are often toxic and not conducive to healthy political discussions. Twitter, the most widely used social network for political discussions, doubled the limit of characters in a tweet in November 2017, which provided an opportunity to study the effect of technological affordances on political discussions using a discontinuous time series design. Using supervised and unsupervised natural language processing methods, we analyzed 358,242 tweet replies to U.S. politicians from January 2017 to March 2018. We show that doubling the permissible length of a tweet led to less uncivil, more polite, and more constructive discussions online. However, the declining trend in the empathy and respectfulness of these tweets raises concerns about the implications of the changing norms for the quality of political deliberation.","[Jaidka, Kokil] Nanyang Technol Univ, Wee Kim Wee Sch Commun & Informat, Singapore 637718, Singapore; [Zhou, Alvin; Lelkes, Yphtach] Univ Penn, Annenberg Sch Commun, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",,"Lelkes, Y (corresponding author), Univ Penn, Annenberg Sch Commun, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",ylelkes@upenn.edu,"Jaidka, Kokil/AAK-2618-2020","Jaidka, Kokil/0000-0002-8127-1157",,,,,97,24,24,9,63,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0021-9916,1460-2466,,J COMMUN,J.

The article analyzes social media tropes circulated across various platforms among Indigenous communities and allies in relation to the #NoDAPL movement. We argue that attempting to analyze Native American traditions through Western theory will only work towards colonizing these Indigenous texts. Thus, whereas we employ insights from digital and visual methods of analysis (Highfield, T., & Leaver, T.(2016). Instagrammatics and digital methods: Studying visual social media, from selfies and GIFs to memes and emoji.

We argue that the visual and digital phenomena we studied might best be understood as a form of digital survivance, drawing upon Anishinaabe scholar Gerald Vizenor [(1994). Manifest manners: Postindian warriors of survivance. Hanover, CT: Wesleyan University Press]. term survivance' as a portmanteau that combines survival' and resistance' in its characterization of Indigenous storytelling traditions. Whereas centering the Indigenous figure of the Trickster might suggest that social media has failed to live up to its promises, this epistemological approach also explains the hope that Indigenous communities hold in uniting via social media for what has been and continues to be a long-term battle for sovereignty and for the protection of the earth and all of its beings.","[Hinzo, Angel M.] Univ San Diego, Dept Ethn Studies, San Diego, CA 92110 USA; [Clark, Lynn Schofield] Univ Denver, Dept Media Film & Journalism Studies, Denver, CO USA",,"Hinzo, AM (corresponding author), Univ San Diego, 5998 Alcala Pk, San Diego, CA 92110 USA.;Clark, LS (corresponding author), Univ Denver, 2490 S Gaylord St, Denver, CO 80208 USA.",AHinzo@sandiego.edu; Lynn.Clark@du.edu,"Hinzo, Angel/AAS-7780-2020",,,,,,55,8,8,1,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

Building upon previous research, we conceptualize how the digital architecture of the platform determines its communication norms and how the actual communication practices implemented by parties and candidates follow or violate these norms. Therefore, we analyze how Instagram is used to implement different campaign strategies, focusing on (1) the use of network-related Instagram features-like Hashtags-, (2) text-integrated images, (3) dominant visual themes, (4) visual personalization, and (5) the addressing of policy issues. Since Germany's voting system rewards both candidate- and party-focused campaigning, the country is an ideal case study for an appropriate comparison of party and candidate accounts. We conducted a quantitative content analysis of all 581 posts published on party and candidate accounts during the four weeks before the election. The results suggest that parties and candidates used complementary communication strategies instead of relying on a single tactic. We are able showing that parties in parts strategically violated Instagram's communication norms to convey hard-to-visualize policy messages while candidates prefered to post professional personalized posts. The presented findings provide a starting point for future studies on the perceptions and behavioral outcomes of different campaign strategies.","[Hassler, Joerg] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Dept Media & Commun, Oettingenstr 67, D-80537 Munich, Germany; [Kuempel, Anna Sophie] Tech Univ Dresden, Inst Media & Commun, Dresden, Germany; [Keller, Jessica] Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Dept Commun, Mainz, Germany",,"Hassler, J (corresponding author), Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Dept Media & Commun, Oettingenstr 67, D-80537 Munich, Germany.",Joerg.Hassler@ifkw.lmu.de,,"Hassler, Jorg/0000-0003-2907-5228; Kumpel, Anna Sophie/0000-0001-7184-4057",Bavarian State Ministry of Science and the Arts,Bavarian State Ministry of Science and the Arts,This publication is part of the work of the junior research group DigiDeMo which is funded by the Bavarian State Ministry of Science and the Arts and coordinated by the Bavarian Research Institute for Digital Transformation (bidt).,,41,2,3,10,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

This article begins with the working assumption that such user labour on social media constitutes a form of playing. It is theorized through a psychoanalytic perspective on the term as developed by D.W.Winnicott and Andre Green. The notion of gaming-playing is put forward to account for set interface structures on Facebook that resemble a game as well as free-flowing dimensions more akin to playing. Some user discourses on Facebook are analysed through this prism. A psychoanalytic conceptualization of user labour as playing allows one to analyse both positive discourses that emphasize Facebook as a space for creativity, exploration and the unknown, as well as negative discourses that critique the platform with regard to lacking privacy controls or data ownership. Both discourses are conducted in a playful manner that creatively utilize a sense of user agency in relation to others and Facebook itself, but often remain without consequences.","[Johanssen, Jacob] Univ Westminster, Commun & Media Res Inst, London, England",,"Johanssen, J (corresponding author), Univ Westminster, Fac Media Arts & Design, Commun & Media Res Inst CAMRI, Watford Rd, Harrow HA1 3TP, Middx, England.",j.johanssen@westminster.ac.uk,,"Johanssen, Jacob/0000-0002-8682-1648",,,,,40,0,0,1,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

We find that the analytical distinction between platforms still matters, since they have different roles in creating and shaping news stories, suggesting that different platform-specific logics are at play. Twitter is an important factor in launching and shaping news stories, but it tends to be dominated by establishment actors (journalists and politicians), whereas citizens only play a modest role.","[Harder, Raymond A.; Paulussen, Steve] Univ Antwerp, Dept Commun Studies, Antwerp, Belgium; [Van Aelst, Peter] Univ Antwerp, Dept Polit Sci, Antwerp, Belgium",,"Harder, RA (corresponding author), Univ Antwerp, Dept Commun Studies, Antwerp, Belgium.",raymond.harder@uantwerpen.be; steve.paulussen@uantwerpen.be; peter.vanaelst@uantwerpen.be,"Van Aelst, Peter/E-2285-2019; Van Aelst, Peter/A-7383-2013; Paulussen, Steve/AAF-8290-2019; Paulussen, Steve/O-7124-2016","Van Aelst, Peter/0000-0002-2548-0309; Van Aelst, Peter/0000-0002-2548-0309; Paulussen, Steve/0000-0002-7903-1103; Paulussen, Steve/0000-0002-7903-1103; Paulussen, Steve/0000-0003-1188-3980",,,,,20,12,12,0,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

For the first time in extant research, we also examine the factors that drive political actors to react to user comments. Findings indicate that the number of followers, the use of an official fan profile, and party vote share were negatively related to political actors' reactions to user comments. Furthermore, party profiles were least successful in stimulating user engagement. On the post level, we found that reasoning, post length, and references to competitive political actors have the potential to increase different types of user engagement. Negative, but not positive tonality increased user engagement and positive emotional expressions had a stronger effect on user engagement than negative emotions. Furthermore, humorous posts were more likely to be commented, liked, or shared, while mobilization cues had predominantly negative effects on user engagement.","[Heiss, Raffael; Schmuck, Desiree] Univ Vienna, Dept Commun, Wahringer Str 29, A-1080 Vienna, Austria; [Matthes, Joerg] Univ Vienna, Dept Commun, Advertising Res, Vienna, Austria",,"Matthes, J (corresponding author), Univ Vienna, Dept Commun, Wahringer Str 29, A-1080 Vienna, Austria.",raffael.heiss@univie.ac.at; desiree.schmuck@univie.ac.at; joerg.matthes@univie.ac.at,"Schmuck, Desiree/AAA-5465-2021","Schmuck, Desiree/0000-0002-9492-6052","Austrian Federal Ministry of Science, Research and Economy [SPA 05/198]","Austrian Federal Ministry of Science, Research and Economy","This work was supported by Austrian Federal Ministry of Science, Research and Economy [grant number SPA 05/198].",,41,55,55,7,43,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

Using automated tools, we scraped 17,347 comments to analyze differences in the quantity, length, and topics of comments that were posted through Ynet's comments section, Facebook Comment Plugin, and Facebook page. Our findings reveal that commenting patterns vary greatly across platforms and news genres. Specifically, the number of comments posted on Ynet's Facebook page is significantly higher than the two other commenting platforms (for both hard and soft news), but these comments are shorter and more emotional. We discuss these findings in relation to the notion of 'context collapse' in social media, and argue that one of the outcomes of the convergence between news content and social media is the augmentation of consensual national sentiment.","[Ben-David, Anat; Soffer, Oren] Open Univ Israel, Dept Sociol Polit Sci & Commun, Raanana, Israel",,"Ben-David, A (corresponding author), Open Univ Israel, Dept Sociol Polit Sci & Commun, Raanana, Israel.",anatbd@gmail.com,"Ben-David, Anat/O-5482-2014","Ben-David, Anat/0000-0003-4510-5634",Israel Science Foundation [898/14],Israel Science Foundation(Israel Science Foundation),This work was supported by Israel Science Foundation [grant number 898/14].,,28,11,11,6,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

This issue relates to the idea of churnalism, which concerns a form of weakened journalism that diminishes the ability to perform expected tasks in a democratic society. As a major social media platform, Facebook has acquired substantial influence over news dissemination, and therefore, scholarly focus needs to be directed to users as news disseminators. The manners by which users share news on Facebook indicate whether churnalism is promoted or abated through users' interaction with online news. In this study, a quantitative content analysis illustrates how 348 news articles published on a local news site were shared 7266 times. The results show that concerns related to churnalism should be directed primarily to the fact that the news outlet only rarely provides users with opportunities to interact with serious or hard news, while lightweight news is frequently offered. Despite this, users abate churnalism in the sense that the news they prefer to share is news from in-house sources rather than from external sources. The news extensively shared covers changes in the vicinity, and health care, and has emerged from local and regional events.","[Almgren, Susanne M.] Jonkoping Univ, Sch Educ & Commun, Jonkoping, Sweden",,"Almgren, SM (corresponding author), Jonkoping Univ, Sch Educ & Commun, Jonkoping, Sweden.",susanne.almgren@ju.se,"Almgren, Susanne M./I-7990-2019","Almgren, Susanne M./0000-0001-9539-9648",,,,,49,3,3,1,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

Reliability was established when two different metrics of inter-coder reliability could not distinguish whether a human or a machine coded the text on a separate hold-out set. Finally, in Step 3 we assessed validity. To accomplish this, we administered a survey in which participants described their own relational uncertainty/certainty via text and completed a questionnaire. After classifying the text, the machine's classifications of the participants' text positively correlated with the subjects' own self-reported relational uncertainty and relational satisfaction.

These revelations led to public outcry, mostly from conservatives upset at possible bias and journalists critical of Facebook for its largely secretive and haphazard approach to news. This study examines the response to the controversy as metajournalistic discourse-talk about news that seeks to define appropriate practices and legitimate news forms. It identifies a fundamental divergence in the public articulation of Facebook's role in the larger news ecosystem. Facebook reacted to the controversy by formulating an approach to news as a form of content that, like other content on the site, should be personalized, organized according to popularity in the form of user engagement, and free of editorial control from the social media site. By contrast, journalists positioned news as purposively selected and shared while placing Facebook as an active participant within the news ecosystem and therefore beholden to an enhanced institutional commitment to public responsibility.","[Carlson, Matt] St Louis Univ, Dept Commun, St Louis, MO 63103 USA",,"Carlson, M (corresponding author), St Louis Univ, Dept Commun, St Louis, MO 63103 USA.",mcarls10@slu.edu,,,,,,,38,55,56,7,53,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

A systematic analysis of Internet search data, social media postings, and newspaper articles allows us to identify how the documentary Gasland reshaped public discourse. We find that Gasland contributed not only to greater online searching about fracking, but also to increased social media chatter and heightened mass media coverage. Local screenings of Gasland contributed to anti-fracking mobilizations, which, in turn, affected the passage of local fracking moratoria in the Marcellus Shale states. These results have implications not only for understanding movement outcomes, but also for theory and research on media, the environment, and energy.","[Vasi, Ion Bogdan] Univ Iowa, Dept Sociol, Iowa City, IA 52241 USA; [Vasi, Ion Bogdan] Univ Iowa, Coll Business, Iowa City, IA 52241 USA; [Walker, Edward T.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Sociol, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA; [Johnson, John S.] Harmony Inst, New York, NY USA; [Tan, Hui Fen] Cornell Univ, Stat, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",,"Vasi, IB (corresponding author), Univ Iowa, Dept Sociol, 120 Seashore Hall, Iowa City, IA 52241 USA.",ion-vasi@uiowa.edu,,,,,,,96,112,112,6,115,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0003-1224,1939-8271,,AM SOCIOL REV,Am.

Following the transition, it is apparent that people are relatively enjoying the freedom of expression. On the contrary, the new digital platform is deemed to be subdued by the emergence of hate speech which is attributed to political, ethnic, and religious underpinnings. The study employs a quantitative approach to analyze users' comments collected from rivalry ethnic-based Television channels' Facebook and YouTube. Using a binary analysis, a substantial prevalence of social media hate speech is found. Mainly ethnic, religious, and political-based hate natures are also found. Most of the hate comments are offensive; however, a few comments are laid on incitement to violence, and genocide severity levels. Contesting memory of the past, associating ethnicity with religion, culture, and language issues are the main triggering factors of hate speech in Ethiopia. The online commenters imitate the offline ethnic tension in the country that upsurge during the political reform.

The images are studied in the framework of media events theory, a concept explained by Dayan and Katz. The study also found that most posts originated from outside France immediately after the incident, while French users posted more in the later days.

Our study focuses on male versus female politicians' ability to engage social media users during an election campaign, using the Israeli 2015 campaign as our case study. Female politicians' posts generated significantly more user engagement in terms of the number of Likes and Shares in comparison to male politicians, while generating the same number of participants in their discussions. The results remained significant in a multilevel analysis, while controlling for other factors such as the politician's age, party, ranking, and number of posts published by the politician. In terms of the posts' content, an examination of their rhetoric did not reveal gender differences in their usage of authoritative voice, facts, and the use of emotions in their messages; however, analysis of the topics did suggest differences in the issues raised by male versus female politicians. The evidence strongly indicates that social media provides greater opportunities for female politicians to promote themselves and improve their status in the political power play.","[Yarchi, Moran; Samuel-Azran, Tal] Interdisciplinary Ctr IDC Herzliya, Sammy Ofer Sch Commun, Kanfei Nesharim St POB 167, IL-46150 Herzliyya, Israel",,"Yarchi, M (corresponding author), Interdisciplinary Ctr IDC Herzliya, Sammy Ofer Sch Commun, Kanfei Nesharim St POB 167, IL-46150 Herzliyya, Israel.",moran.yarchi@gmail.com,"Yarchi, Moran/H-6480-2015","Yarchi, Moran/0000-0002-8044-2145",,,,,65,22,22,7,40,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

We expose subjects to different types of Facebook content and track their gaze as they browse through posts. Substantively, we find that news and social content garner equal attention, with politics trailing behind both. We also find that the style of the post matters for attention patterns, with richer content (e.g., pictures, links) enhancing attention especially for social and news posts. Methodologically, we conclude that participants are unable to accurately report the topics and types of content available on the Facebook feed, even immediately after exposure.

While previous research has identified important consequences of this mandate divide in parliaments, questions remain how this institutional setup affects MPs' political behavior in other arenas. Analyzing more than one million social media posts, this article investigates regional representation in the online communication of German MPs. The results show that MPs elected under a direct mandate refer approximately twice as often to their constituencies by using regionalized wording and geographic references than MPs elected under the proportional tier. The substantive findings provide new evidence for the benefits of mixed-member electoral systems for political representation while the methodological approach demonstrates the added value of social media data for analyzing the political behavior of elites.","[Schuermann, Lennart] Univ Cologne, Cologne Ctr Comparat Polit, Cologne, Germany; [Stier, Sebastian] GESIS Leibniz Inst Social Sci Cologne, Dept Computat Social Sci, Cologne, Germany",,"Schurmann, L (corresponding author), Univ Cologne, Cologne Ctr Comparat Polit, Cologne, Germany.",,,"Schurmann, Lennart/0000-0002-2444-7486",ProjektDEAL,ProjektDEAL,"We are indebted to Jasmin Spekkers for her excellent research assistance.

A representative case of this reality, which reached a high coverage and support in social media environment, can be found in the riots that took place in the Gamonal neighbourhood (Burgos, Spain) in January 2014. In this regard, this article focuses on the denunciation of police violence through video activism by Twitter users during the demonstrations across the country, applying a quantitative-qualitative mixed methodology. First, by means of a content analysis, a sample of 784 tweets linked to videos is analysed in order to identify the main topics and functions of the shared content. Second, a textual analysis of those linked videos of a violent nature recorded by witnesses in order to document police interventions is carried out. The prominent use of Twitter for distributing videos to denounce police violence stands out among the main findings, underlining the audiovisual exposure and secondary visibility' of the police officers. The results obtained also reinforce the idea of citizen empowerment through the development of an alternative form of journalism, as a practice to criticize the mainstream media coverage of the protests. Additionally, this article sheds light on the open debate about the relevance of social media to encourage citizen involvement in a face-to-face interaction.","[Hermida, Alberto; Hernandez-Santaolalla, Victor] Univ Seville, Dept Audiovisual Commun & Advertising, Seville, Spain",,"Hermida, A (corresponding author), Univ Seville, Dept Audiovisual Commun & Advertising, Fac Commun, Amer Vespucio Ave, E-41092 Seville, Spain.",ahermida@us.es; vhsantaolalla@us.es,"Hernández-Santaolalla, Víctor/D-2532-2013; Hermida, Alberto/AAF-8401-2020","Hernández-Santaolalla, Víctor/0000-0002-2207-4014; Hermida, Alberto/0000-0003-4155-0108",,,,,51,25,27,5,38,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

J,"Carlson, M",,,,"Carlson, Matt",,,Fake news as an informational moral panic: the symbolic deviancy of social media during the 2016 US presidential election,INFORMATION COMMUNICATION & SOCIETY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Fake news; journalism; informational moral panic; social media; platforms; political communication,JOURNALISM; DISCOURSE; CRISIS,"A persistent story about the 2016 US presidential election was the preponderance of fake news stories on social media, and on Facebook in particular, that had no basis in fact but were wholly concocted to quickly amass clicks that could be converted into advertising revenues. This study steps outside of arguments about the spread or efficacy of fake news to instead interrogate its symbolic dimensions and its meaning for both journalism and the larger system of political communication. To conceptualize the role of fake news as a particular symbol, this paper approaches the journalistic condemnation of fake news as an 'informational moral panic.' This concept builds off Cohen's classic formulation of moral panics as public anxiety that a particular social threat will lead to declining standards. The ability to define a phenomenon as an informational moral panic is an exercise in cultural power that ascribes deviancy to particular actors while validating others. In the case of fake news, the anxiety is not so much directed toward a particular group but aimed at the larger transformation of informational spaces made possible by social media. An examination of journalists' responses in the US press during November 2016 reveals four domains of focus - production, platform, subsidy, and consumption - each with its own narratives of blame and remedy. Fake news becomes a particular signifier that condenses broader concerns surrounding the eroding boundaries of traditional journalistic channels, click-driven news, the extension of mediated voices, and the growing role of social media in news distribution.","[Carlson, Matt] Univ Minnesota, Hubbard Sch Journalism, Mass Commun, Minneapolis, MN USA; [Carlson, Matt] Univ Minnesota, Hubbard Sch Journalism,CONTACT,Matt Carlson, Mass Commun, 206 Church St SE, Room 111 Murphy Hall, Minneapolis, MN USA",,"Carlson, M (corresponding author), Univ Minnesota, Hubbard Sch Journalism, Mass Commun, Minneapolis, MN USA.;Carlson, M (corresponding author), Univ Minnesota, Hubbard Sch Journalism,CONTACT,Matt Carlson, Mass Commun, 206 Church St SE, Room 111 Murphy Hall, Minneapolis, MN USA.",carlson1@umn.edu,,"Carlson, Matt/0000-0001-5674-5595",,,,,30,43,44,15,124,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

Recent updates to cascading activation, originally developed to explain how frames flowing from powerful figures gain public dominance, give greater theoretical scope for audiences to exert influence. Yet empirical understanding of how and in what circumstances this happens with respect to agenda-setting-another core media effect-is not well-developed, especially given the affordances of digital technologies. We address this gap by connecting theorization on cascades to developments in intermedia agenda-setting. Specifically, we analyze the dynamics surrounding the perceived reluctance by ARD-aktuell, the newsroom of Germany's public broadcasting consortium, to use its prime-time broadcast Tagesschau to report the arrest of a refugee accused of murdering a German woman in December 2016. By presenting finely grained timelines linking content analysis of 5,409 Facebook comments with Tagesschau editorial responses and parallel media coverage of this event, we contribute further conditions under which audience-informed cascades may occur: notably, when publicly funded news organizations are involved, and the issue at stake invokes both domestic and international aspects which sustain disagreement.","[Landis, Benjamin Till] Univ Oxford, Lincoln Coll, Oxford, Oxon, England; [Allen, William L.] Univ Oxford, Dept Polit & Int Relat DPIR, Oxford, Oxon, England; [Allen, William L.] Univ Oxford, Ctr Migrat Policy & Soc COMPAS, Oxford, Oxon, England",,"Allen, WL (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Dept Polit & Int Relat DPIR, Oxford, Oxon, England.;Allen, WL (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Ctr Migrat Policy & Soc COMPAS, Oxford, Oxon, England.",william.allen@politics.ox.ac.uk,"Allen, William/H-9007-2019","Allen, William/0000-0003-3185-1468",,,,,57,0,0,2,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

The analysis shows the dominance of political sources across countries and platforms, particularly in Latin America, demonstrating a strong role of the state in constructing pandemic news and suggesting that mainstream news organizations' social media posts maintain a strong elite orientation. Health sources were also prominent - consistent with the defining role of biomedical authority in health coverage-, while significant diversity of sources, including citizen sources, emerged as the pandemic went on.

Specifically, we compare the content and style of parties' Facebook posts during the 2014 European parliament elections, and how this affects followers' responses in terms of liking, sharing and commenting on the posts. Our findings reveal while that the timing and visual content of posts are important in increasing voters' attention, interactivity matters most. Responsive party posts on Facebooks are significantly more likely to be shared, liked, and commented on by users. Given that follower reactions, particularly sharing, helps to increase the visibility of party communication through indirect or two-step flow communication (online and offline), these findings are important in advancing our understanding of how and why social media campaigns are able to influence voters and thus affect election outcomes.

It is based upon two comparative studies conducted in 2011 and 2013 involving interviews with reporters, photographers and senior editorial staff, a discussion of the company Twitter guidelines and a content analysis of 27 Twitter accounts. During the research timeframe, Twitter use increased dramatically amongst journalists leading to a clearer set of emerging practices. The data suggest that types of Twitter use are diverse but routine practices are forming in the areas of newsgathering and live reporting, causing a shift in traditional gatekeeping and verification conventions. The notion that journalists primarily use Twitter to drive traffic to their legacy platform is not supported but there is evidence of personal branding and journalists presenting a personalised-but not personal-account of their job via their tweets.","[Canter, Lily] Sheffield Hallam Univ, Media Arts & Commun, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England",,"Canter, L (corresponding author), Sheffield Hallam Univ, Media Arts & Commun, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England.",l.canter@shu.ac.uk,,,,,,,47,44,44,0,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

These developments have occurred in tandem with, and accelerated by, the emergence of digital and social media. Research on news production has shown that journalistic work has always taken emotion into consideration, shaping approaches to storytelling and presentation. However, the view of journalists as detached observers has rendered the emotional labor associated with news production invisible. Research on emotion in journalistic texts has highlighted the fact that even conventional hard news genres are shaped by an engagement with emotion. As studies on news audiences and emotions have shown, audiences are more likely to be emotionally engaged, recall information and take action when news stories are relatable. The affordances of digital platforms and social media have had a profound impact on the space for emotion. The expanded opportunities for participation have contributed to questioning traditional distinctions between news audiences and producers and have ushered in new and more forms of emotional expression that have spilled over into practices of news production.","[Wahl-Jorgensen, Karin] Cardiff Univ, Sch Journalism Media & Culture, Cardiff, S Glam, Wales",,"Wahl-Jorgensen, K (corresponding author), Cardiff Univ, Sch Journalism Media & Culture, Cardiff, S Glam, Wales.",wahl-jorgensenk@cardiff.ac.uk,,,,,,,111,77,77,37,73,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

The results showed that information utility-related message features increased the duration for which articles prompted email-based sharing, whereas emotional positivity and controversiality increased the longevity of social media-based sharing. Expressed emotional evocativeness and the absence of death-related words lengthened the duration for which articles prompted both email- and social media-based sharing. News retransmission, via either email or social media, was more likely to persist when the articles stayed on the most-emailed list for a longer time, showing social endorsement-driven cumulative advantage effects. The results further revealed synergistic interaction effects between social endorsements and message features. While social endorsements produced strong cumulative-advantage effects on the longevity of news sharing, articles with certain message features that are diagnostic of their inherent share-worthiness generated even stronger effects than those articles that appeared on the most-emailed list for the same amount of time but lacked such features. These features were expressed emotional evocativeness (email-based sharing), the absence of death-related words, and exemplification (social media-based sharing).","[Kim, Hyun Suk] Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Commun, Seoul, South Korea",,"Kim, HS (corresponding author), Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Commun, Seoul, South Korea.",hyunsuk.kim@snu.ac.kr,,,"National Cancer Institute at the National Institutes of Health [R01CA160226, 5U01CA154254]; Annenberg (Dissertation Research Fellowship); Wharton (Russell Ackoff Doctoral Student Fellowship) Schools at the University of Pennsylvania; research resettlement fund for new faculty [200-20180112]; Institute of Communication Research at Seoul National University; Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea; National Research Foundation of Korea [NRF-2018S1A5B8070398]",National Cancer Institute at the National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Cancer Institute (NCI)); Annenberg (Dissertation Research Fellowship); Wharton (Russell Ackoff Doctoral Student Fellowship) Schools at the University of Pennsylvania; research resettlement fund for new faculty; Institute of Communication Research at Seoul National University; Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea; National Research Foundation of Korea(National Research Foundation of Korea),"The author acknowledges the funding support of the National Cancer Institute at the National Institutes of Health (R01CA160226 and 5U01CA154254), the Annenberg (Dissertation Research Fellowship) and Wharton (Russell Ackoff Doctoral Student Fellowship) Schools at the University of Pennsylvania, the research resettlement fund for new faculty (200-20180112) and the Institute of Communication Research at Seoul National University, and the Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea and the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF-2018S1A5B8070398).

Brown's body lay in the street for four and a half hours, and during that time, his neighbors and friends took to social media to express fear, confusion, and outrage. We locate early tweets about Ferguson and the use of the hashtag #Ferguson at the center of a counterpublic network that provoked and shaped public debates about race, policing, governance, and justice. Extending theory on networked publics, we examine how everyday citizens, followed by activists and journalists, influenced the #Ferguson Twitter network with a focus on emergent counterpublic structure and discursive strategy. We stress the importance of combining quantitative and qualitative methods to identify early initiators of online dissent and story framing. We argue that initiators and their discursive contributions are often missed by methods that collapse longitudinal network data into a single snapshot rather than investigating the dynamic emergence of crowdsourced elites over time.","[Jackson, Sarah J.; Welles, Brooke Foucault] Northeastern Univ, Commun Studies, Boston, MA 02115 USA",,"Jackson, SJ (corresponding author), Northeastern Univ, Commun Studies, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",s.jackson@neu.edu; b.welles@neu.edu,"Jackson, Sarah J./K-4448-2019","Jackson, Sarah J./0000-0001-5996-0346",,,,,24,117,117,8,87,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

This paper addresses the social effects of content ratings through a case study of Reddit. Reddit is a social news site on which users in topic-based communities (subreddits) create posts upon which others upvote, downvote, and comment. Vote scores indicate convergence with, and divergence from, community norms. Analysing data from the platform's three most popular subreddits, we ask: How do rating features afford emotional expression and content engagement? Findings from a Variable-Lag Granger Causality model show that for a portion of Reddit users (14.5%), vote scores predict subsequent emotional expression, with upvotes preceding positive sentiments and downvotes preceding negative sentiments. This is the first systematic test of how ratings influence emotional expression on a social media platform. Findings also show that downvoted content receives higher levels of engagement than upvoted content. Together, these findings suggest a paradox in which divergence from community norms, as indicated by vote score patterns, have emotional consequences and attention rewards.","[Davis, Jenny L.] Australian Natl Univ, Sch Sociol, Acton, Australia; [Graham, Timothy] Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Commun, Brisbane, Qld, Australia",,"Davis, JL (corresponding author), Australian Natl Univ, Sch Sociol, Acton, Australia.",Jennifer.Davis@anu.edu.au,"; Davis, Jenny L/P-1898-2017","Graham, Timothy/0000-0002-4053-9313; Davis, Jenny L/0000-0003-0952-5842",Google: [Cloud Education Grants],Google: [Cloud Education Grants],This work was supported by Google: [Cloud Education Grants].,,47,5,5,12,24,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

Platformed racism has dual meanings: first, it evokes platforms as amplifiers and manufacturers of racist discourse and second, it describes the modes of platform governance that reproduce (but that can also address) social inequalities. The national and medium specificity of platformed racism requires nuanced investigation. As a first step, I examined platformed racism through a particular national race-based controversy, the booing of the Australian Football League Indigenous star Adam Goodes, as it was mediated by Twitter, Facebook and YouTube. Second, by using an issue mapping approach to social media analysis, I followed the different actors, themes and objects involved in this controversy to account for the medium specificity of platforms. Platformed racism unfolded in the Adam Goodes controversy as the entanglement between users' practices to disguise and amplify racist humour and abuse, and the contribution of platforms' features and algorithms in the circulation of overt and covert hate speech. In addition, the distributed nature of platforms' editorial practices. which involve their technical infrastructure, policies, moderators and users' curation of content. obscured the scope and type of this abuse. The paper shows that the concept of platformed racism challenges the discourse of neutrality that characterises social media platforms' self-representations, and opens new theoretical terrain to engage with their material politics.","[Matamoros-Fernandez, Ariadna] Queensland Univ Technol, Digital Media Res Ctr, Brisbane, Qld, Australia",,"Matamoros-Fernandez, A (corresponding author), Queensland Univ Technol, Digital Media Res Ctr, Brisbane, Qld, Australia.",ariadna.matamorosfernandez@qut.edu.au,,"Matamoros Fernandez, Ariadna/0000-0003-2149-3820",,,,,92,112,112,18,94,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

Amidst ubiquitous technologies of production, distribution, and promotion, the ideal of entrepreneurialism has taken on a political valance: that is, individuals are ostensibly 'empowered' to pursue their passion projects in digital environments. This project brings gender politics to the fore of contemporary discourses of online entrepreneurship. We draw upon in-depth interviews with 22 independently employed female professionals, the majority of whom work in digital media/creative fields, to understand the role of social media in their self-starter careers. Many interviewees were compelled to develop and present online personae that conformed to traditional prescriptions for femininity - a quandary that we term the digital double bind. An updated version of the career impasse that female workers face in offline work environments, the digital double bind is structured through three distinct, yet interrelated, social media imperatives: (1) soft self-promotion; (2) interactive intimacy; and (3) compulsory visibility. Participants' reflections on these imperatives emerge from the traditionally masculine-coded nature of entrepreneurship and its markers of success, which require female workers to assume additional risk and engage in invisible labor. The digital double bind is thus a testament to enduring structural inequalities that render female self-enterprise an inferior category of entrepreneurship; promises of digitally enabled meritocracy, we conclude, are largely superficial.","[Duffy, Brooke Erin] Cornell Univ, Dept Commun, Ithaca, NY USA; [Pruchniewska, Urszula] Temple Univ, Media & Commun Program, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA",,"Duffy, BE (corresponding author), Cornell Univ, Dept Commun, Ithaca, NY USA.",bduffy@cornell.edu; urszula.p@temple.edu,,,,,,,53,52,52,6,59,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

Specifically, the study focuses on how populist actors in Greece campaigned on Facebook and examines their communicative performance in terms of user engagement in comparison with that of their opponents. For this purpose, a quantitative content analysis was performed by analyzing the Facebook posts published by populist and non-populist candidates over one week preceding the July 7 elections. Results suggest that candidates from populist parties, such as SYRIZA (Coalition of the Radical Left) and EL (Greek Solution), were outpaced by the mainstream New Democracy party that won the election. Moreover, significant differences are observed between populist and non-populist actors regarding the communication strategies utilized. Results suggest that different communication strategies have varying effects on user engagement depending on the populist identity of candidates, as well as their position in the left-right political spectrum. Several practical implications are proposed regarding the effective orchestration of Facebook campaigns by populist and non-populist actors.","[Triantafillidou, Amalia] Univ Western Macedonia, Fourka Area, Dept Commun & Digital Media, Kastoria 52100, Greece",,"Triantafillidou, A (corresponding author), Univ Western Macedonia, Fourka Area, Dept Commun & Digital Media, Kastoria 52100, Greece.",atriantafylidou@uowm.gr,,,EU,EU(European Commission),"Georgios Lappas, (PhD in Computer Science, MSc in Applied Artificial Intelligence) is a Professor in Information Technology with emphases on Social and Political Informatics.

The findings from the content analysis of 5,556 tweets reveal that the tweets were mainly posted by ordinary citizens and counter-protesters rather than those who scorned the company. Moreover, the results showcased how each camp utilized different protest framing strategies. In particular, while the protesters primarily used motivational frames to entice individual participation via uninstalling Gojek from their mobile phones, counter-protesters predominantly employed diagnostic frames to identify core concerns about the legitimacy of the protest. There was also a weak presence of prognostic frames as both groups did not articulate solutions for the problems. Furthermore, while the protesters often espoused religious, moral, and cultural values, which became the rallying cry against non-heteronormativity, the counter-protesters refuted and overshadowed these narratives by highlighting the economic benefit of Gojek.","[Oktavianus, Jeffry; Davidson, Brenna] City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Media & Commun, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Guan, Lu] Fudan Univ, Sch Journalism, Shanghai, Peoples R China",,"Oktavianus, J (corresponding author), City Univ Hong Kong, Run Run Shaw Creat Media Ctr, Dept Media & Commun, Kowloon Tong,Kowloon, Room 5102,18 Tat Hong Ave, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",jeffry.oktavianus@my.cityu.edu.hk,"Davidson, Brenna/AAB-9149-2022","Davidson, Brenna/0000-0003-2370-0547; Guan, Lu/0000-0002-9309-2834; OKTAVIANUS, Jeffry/0000-0002-0304-9614",,,,,60,0,0,4,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

On social media direct feedback mechanisms such as retweets or likes signal to politicians which message and tone are popular. Current research suggests that negative language increases the number of retweets a single tweet receives, indicating preferences for negativity in the audience on Twitter. However, it remains unclear whether politicians adapt to the logic of Twitter or simply follow the rules determined by the broader political context, namely the state of their electoral race. We use sentiment analysis to measure the tone used by 342 candidates in 97,909 tweets in their Twitter campaign in the 2018 midterm elections for the US House of Representatives and map the ideological composition of each politician's Twitter network. We show that the feedback candidates receive creates an incentive to use negativity. The size and direction of the tonal incentive is connected to the ideological composition of the candidate's follower network. Unexpectedly, the platform-specific incentive does not affect the tone used by candidates in their Twitter campaigns. Instead we find that the tone is mainly related to characteristics of the electoral race. We show that our findings are not dependent on our sentiment measurement by validating our results using hand coding and machine learning.","[Mueller, Samuel David; Saeltzer, Marius] Univ Mannheim, Polit Sci, A5,6, D-68131 Mannheim, Germany",,"Mueller, SD (corresponding author), Univ Mannheim, Polit Sci, A5,6, D-68131 Mannheim, Germany.",sammuell@mail.uni-mannheim.de,"Saeltzer, Marius/AAM-8268-2021","Saeltzer, Marius/0000-0002-8604-4666",University of Mannheim's Graduate School of Economic and Social Sciences (GESS),University of Mannheim's Graduate School of Economic and Social Sciences (GESS),This work was supported by the University of Mannheim's Graduate School of Economic and Social Sciences (GESS).,,52,4,4,3,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

In our study, we combine the two strands of research about media repertoires as well as transnational news consumption. Switzerland is a compelling case with regard to transnational news consumption as media outlets in the three official languages, German, French, and Italian can reach audiences in the larger neighbouring countries of Germany, France, and Italy. To investigate transnational news consumption, we tracked URL shares of Swiss online news media websites for two months on Twitter. We then combined this data with the users' followee structures in the Twitter network (n = 355,197 tweets, n = 64,170 unique users) and inductively detected domestic and foreign audience communities with social network analysis. Thus, we were able to identify and compare the Twitter news media repertoires of domestic and foreign audience communities. Regarding transnational usage patterns, we show that especially quality media brands continuously reach audience communities in neighbouring countries.","[Rauchfleisch, Adrian] Natl Taiwan Univ, Grad Inst Journalism, Taipei, Taiwan; [Vogler, Daniel] Univ Zurich, Dept Commun & Media Res, Zurich, Switzerland; [Vogler, Daniel; Eisenegger, Mark] Univ Zurich, Res Ctr Publ Sphere & Soc, Zurich, Switzerland",,"Rauchfleisch, A (corresponding author), Natl Taiwan Univ, Grad Inst Journalism, Taipei, Taiwan.",adrian.rauchfleisch@gmail.com,"Rauchfleisch, Adrian/AAK-4164-2020","RAUCHFLEISCH, ADRIAN/0000-0003-1232-083X; Vogler, Daniel/0000-0002-0211-7574; Eisenegger, Mark/0000-0002-4964-2528",,,,,53,3,3,3,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

The study found divergent disclosure practices across websites, between language and visual disclosures, and between native ad links on the homepage and native ad posts on story pages within a website. Overall, older organizations with more Pulitzer awards and younger organizations with relatively more Pulitzer awards and social media followers seemed to execute clearer disclosure. Moreover, the organizations with more Pulitzer awards seemed to impose a clearer disclosure language on native ad links at gateway locations than those with fewer awards but lessened disclosure of native ad posts on the landing pages. The older news websites with more social media followers adopted an obscurer disclosure language of native ad links but distinguished native ad posts more once audiences landed on the content page. This study recommends media effect scholars take a holistic approach to assess ad recognition and suggest publishers build on cultural capital as an ultimate defense against heteronomous forces.","[Li, You] Eastern Michigan Univ, School Commun Media & Theatre Arts, Ypsilanti, MI 48197 USA; [Wang, Ye] Univ Missouri, Dept Commun, Kansas City, MO 64110 USA",,"Li, Y (corresponding author), Eastern Michigan Univ, School Commun Media & Theatre Arts, Ypsilanti, MI 48197 USA.",yli23@emich.edu,,,,,,,66,0,0,1,1,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

The online conversation surrounding Kentucky county clerk Kim Davis who was jailed for refusing to issue gay marriage licenses provides insight into the rhetoric used in political memes. Through qualitative and quantitative analysis using a lens of feminist humor theory, this study of Davis-related memes suggests that users trying to battle anti-gay ideologies resorted to anti-feminist rhetoric by targeting her physical appearance as a woman and using traditional 'slut humor.' Additionally, civil rights comparisons illustrate a misconstrued understanding of race and hegemony. Thus, far from serving as an alternative public sphere for marginalized voices, we conclude Internet memes are maintaining the status quo, furthering gendered political and communications systems and virtually ignoring the underlying gay rights issue.","[Harlow, Summer] Univ Houston, Jack J Valenti Sch Commun, Journalism, 3347 Cullen Blvd, Houston, TX 77204 USA; [Rowlett, Jerrica Ty; Huse, Laura-Kate] Florida State Univ, Sch Commun, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA",,"Harlow, S (corresponding author), Univ Houston, Jack J Valenti Sch Commun, Journalism, 3347 Cullen Blvd, Houston, TX 77204 USA.",sharlow@central.uh.edu,"Harlow, Summer/AAK-8867-2020","Harlow, Summer/0000-0001-6079-1439",,,,,61,5,5,1,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

A typology of online ironic markers,INFORMATION COMMUNICATION & SOCIETY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Irony; social media; boundary work; polysemy; interpretive failure,HUMOR,"Social media constitute a fertile though challenging arena for the use of ironic humor. A combination of facilitating and hindering factors turns the production and identification of irony in this sphere into a complex venture, positioning it as a powerful tool in consolidating group boundaries. The main aims of this paper are to identify the markers of ironic humor on social media and to explicate their workings within the dynamics of digital interactions. Existing literature about ironic markers addresses mostly face-to-face and mass-mediated interactions, while there is a gap in our understanding of the production and interpretation of irony in the unique communicative conditions of social media. An analysis of a bilingual corpus of successful and failed ironic utterances extracted from five social network sites yielded a novel typology of five ironic markers: platform, participants, style, intra-textual content, and contextual knowledge. These markers both resemble and deviate from features of irony in non-digital settings. Media affordances often allow access to necessary complementary information, yet such forensic activity is only accessible to active users, who recognize the need for further investigation of the meant. Hence, using certain types of ironic markers forms utterances that are decipherable to some audiences but opaque to others. In this sense, the marking of digital irony and its decoding both rely on group boundaries and play a central role in their delineation. We conclude by evaluating the roles of this new regime of ironic markers in processes of boundary work.","[Gal, Noam; Kampf, Zohar; Shifman, Limor] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Commun & Journalism, Jerusalem, Israel",,"Gal, N (corresponding author), Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Commun & Journalism, Jerusalem, Israel.",noam.gal@mail.huji.ac.il,,"Kampf, Zohar/0000-0003-3563-1403",Smart Institute at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem,Smart Institute at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem,This research was supported by the Smart Institute at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.,,34,3,3,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

This article emphasises the latent phase of the movement, by combining Melucci's processual and dynamic approach to collective identity with a practice-oriented ecological perspective to the media/movements studies. Based on in-depth interviews and the analysis of the common Twitter followings among the interviewees, this article provides empirical insights into the use of Twitter in the collective identity construction process through analysing its three main elements: (1) the identification of we and them, (2) development of informal networks and (3) expression and negotiation of collective identity. Extending the existing body of literature, which focus on instantaneous uses and short-term instances, it complements the research on the nexus of collective identity and social media, by focusing on the daily practices, motivations and experiences of the activists on Twitter in interaction with evolving media ecology and other actors in its local context. This study indicates the uses of Twitter and new communicative practices in the latent phase for the continuity of Occupy Gezi, in which they maintained, promoted and negotiated collective identity. Thus, they could still keep and pass the movement's repertoire, values, language and resistance culture to successors, even in the direct antagonistic confrontation of the authorities.","[Karatas, Duygu] Univ Siegen, Media Studies, Fac Arts & Humanities, DFG SFB 1472 Transformat,Popular Herrenga 3, D-57072 Siegen, Germany",,"Karatas, D (corresponding author), Univ Siegen, Media Studies, Fac Arts & Humanities, DFG SFB 1472 Transformat,Popular Herrenga 3, D-57072 Siegen, Germany.",duygu.karatas@uni-siegen.de,,,,,,,49,0,0,2,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

While Zimbabwe experienced its first total internet shutdown then, the government previously imposed other forms of restrictions to social network platform access, including the removal of a Facebook page of 'whistleblower' Baba Jukwa in 2014. Moreover, the government's 2018 National Policy for Information and Communication Technology initiative promised more centralized state control of the country's internet traffic. These issues and potential realities raise concerns for journalists and storytellers in Zimbabwe. How can they can circumvent censorship online? How does their use of social media complicate conceptualizations of temporality and censorship on the internet? Shortly after the shutdown ended, the Johannesburg Review of Books published a story by a journalist formatted as a Twitter timeline from his 'recollections and imaginings' of what he would have posted during the week-long social media blackout. It included descriptions of protests, statements about the state, and satire aimed at the president, telling the type of stories that the government had attempted to censor. As a vehicle for the piece, the JRB created a new Twitter account, @Zvakadhakwa, for the tweets. This paper explores notions of risk, transparency, and opacity in journalism, and storytelling under surveillance and digital censorship in Zimbabwe, by engaging with scholarship on Baba Jukwa Facebook posts before the internet shutdown in Zimbabwe and deploying a close textual analysis of the alternate Twitter timeline.","[Madenga, Florence] Univ Penn, Annenberg Sch Commun, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",,"Madenga, F (corresponding author), Univ Penn, Annenberg Sch Commun, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",florence.madenga@asc.upenn.edu,,,,,,,58,2,2,2,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

It investigates the leading discourses emerging from these memes to provide insight into the political culture that surfaces at the intersection between the ordinary of everyday social media uses and the extraordinary of crisis events. We combined digital methods and netnographic techniques to generate and analyse a dataset of over 9,000 Covid-19 memetic instances produced on Twitter by Italian publics during the first national lockdown. Our findings show that in early everyday pandemic memes the political stake did not manifest itself in the explicitness of values, attitudes, and knowledge tightly packaged in a purposeful and self-aware political culture. It rather surfaced in the form of a mundane political culture - one that was primarily performative, irrespective of any future political action, and marked by populist values.","[Murru, Maria Francesca] Univ Bergamo, Dept Literature Philosophy & Commun, Sede Pignolo, I-24129 Bergamo, Italy; [Vicari, Stefania] Univ Sheffield, Dept Sociol Studies, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England",,"Murru, MF (corresponding author), Univ Bergamo, Dept Literature Philosophy & Commun, Sede Pignolo, I-24129 Bergamo, Italy.",mariafrancesca.murru@unibg.it,"Vicari, Stefania/AAG-7400-2022","Vicari, Stefania/0000-0002-4506-2358",,,,,49,1,1,4,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

The Twitter profiles of 16 journalists working at The Star in Sheffield were captured in 2014 and a content analysis was conducted to examine the types of information each individual was reporting. The data revealed Twitter was being utilised as a versatile tool for gathering, reporting and disseminating news, and there was correlation between types of tweets and the job role of the profile account holder. Those in managerial positions tended to include more hyperlinks to their own news website and use Twitter as a promotional tool whereas sports journalists tended to use the social media platform as a live reporting tool. News reporters at the newspaper did not regularly link back to their legacy platform, preferring to use Twitter to build relationships and interactions with users. The authors conclude that these data together with similar comparative studies are useful for identifying patterns in changing journalistic roles within a local, national and international context. The emerging trends challenge the notion of the redefinition of the journalist as a universal role and instead point towards multiple redefinitions of the varying roles of journalists.","[Canter, Lily; Brookes, Daniel] Sheffield Hallam Univ, Media Arts & Commun, Sheffield S1 1WB, S Yorkshire, England",,"Canter, L (corresponding author), Sheffield Hallam Univ, Media Arts & Commun, Sheffield S1 1WB, S Yorkshire, England.",l.canter@shu.ac.uk; danny.brookes@hotmail.com,,,,,,,36,14,14,0,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

We introduce a systematic literature review concerning content analyses of user comments in a journalistic context. Our review covers 192 papers identified through a systematic search focussing on communication studies and computer science. We find that research predominantly concentrates on the comment sections of Anglo-American newspaper brands and on aspects like hate speech, general incivility, or users' opinions on specific issues, while disregarding media from other parts of the world, comments in social media, propaganda, and constructive comments.

Political deaths and Twitter discourses in Argentina and Russia,INFORMATION COMMUNICATION & SOCIETY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Political murder; democratization; opposition; automation; Twitter; Boris Nemtsov; Alberto Nisman; multilingual content analysis,PUBLIC SPHERE; MEDIA; INTERNET; ACTIVISM; NEWS,"The big question that pervades debate between techno-optimists and their detractors is whether social media are good for democracy. Do they help to produce or accelerate democratic change or, alternatively, might they hinder it? This article foregrounds an alternative perspective, arguing that individual social networking applications likely do not fulfil a single political function across national contexts. Their functionality may be mediated instead by language and by pre-existing relationships between the state and offline domestic media. We arrive at this conclusion through examining reactions on Twitter to two fatal events that occurred in early 2015: the death in suspicious and politically charged circumstances of the special prosecutor Alberto Nisman in Argentina, and the murder in Russia of opposition activist Boris Nemtsov. Several similarities between the two deaths provide the conditions for a comparative analysis of the discourses around them in the Spanish-language and Russian-language Twitter spheres, respectively. In Russia, a hostile social media environment polluted by high levels of automated content and other spam reduced the utility of Twitter for opposition voices, who work against an increasingly authoritarian state. In Argentina, a third-wave democracy, Twitter discourses appeared as predominantly coextensive with other pro-government and opposition online, print, and broadcast information and opinion sources, thus consolidating and amplifying a highly polarized and repetitive wider public political conversation. Despite the potential for social media to help citizens circumvent formal and informal restrictions to discursive participation in national public spheres, in the cases that we compare here domestic political structures play a key role in determining the uses and limitations of online spaces for recounting and expressing opinion on current affairs stories involving the state.","[Filer, Tanya; Fredheim, Rolf] Univ Cambridge, Ctr Res Arts Social Sci & Humanities, Alison Richard Bldg,7 West Rd, Cambridge CB3 9DT, England",,"Filer, T (corresponding author), Univ Cambridge, Ctr Res Arts Social Sci & Humanities, Alison Richard Bldg,7 West Rd, Cambridge CB3 9DT, England.",tf239@cam.ac.uk,,,,,,,29,14,14,0,55,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

To understand why, this article offers a theory about criminal governance in five types of criminal regimes-Insurgent, Bandit, Symbiotic, Predatory, and Split. These differ according to whether criminal groups confront or collude with state actors, abuse or cooperate with the community, and hold a monopoly or contest territory with rival OCGs. Police interventions in these criminal regimes pose different challenges and are associated with markedly different local security outcomes.

These utilise social media to foster online spaces that strengthen and popularise anti-vaccination discourses. In this paper, we examine the characteristics of and the discourses present within six popular anti-vaccination Facebook pages. We examine these large-scale datasets using a range of methods, including social network analysis, gender prediction using historical census data, and generative statistical models for topic analysis (Latent Dirichletallocation). We find that present-day discourses centre around moral outrage and structural oppression by institutional government and the media, suggesting a strong logic of 'conspiracy-style' beliefs and thinking. Furthermore, anti-vaccination pages on Facebook reflect a highly 'feminised' movement the vast majority of participants are women. Although anti-vaccination networks on Facebook are large and global in scope, the comment activity sub-networks appear to be 'small world'. This suggests that social media may have a role in spreading anti-vaccination ideas and making the movement durable on a global scale.","[Smith, Naomi] Federat Univ Australia, Sch Arts Humanities & Social Sci, POB 3191, Gippsland, Vic 3841, Australia; [Graham, Tim] Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Comp Sci, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Graham, Tim] Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Social Sci, Canberra, ACT, Australia",,"Smith, N (corresponding author), Federat Univ Australia, Sch Arts Humanities & Social Sci, POB 3191, Gippsland, Vic 3841, Australia.",n.smith@federation.edu.au; Timothy.Graham@anu.edu.au,,"Smith, Naomi/0000-0002-6509-1199; Graham, Timothy/0000-0002-4053-9313",,,,,31,109,110,23,138,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

We use text analyses to characterize the frequency, toxicity, and tone of comments in the chat. Our experimental findings indicate that Democratic subjects assigned to the Facebook (social) chat condition reported lower affect toward Democrats and a worse viewing experience, aligned with the toxic and overwhelming nature of the chat. The polarity of candidate-directed comments also influenced candidate evaluations and perceived performance in the polls.

This project qualitatively explores US college students' exposure to and experiences with content on social media that they consider to be related to race and racial discrimination. Based on analysis of focus groups, we highlight the role of digital documentation, mediated spillover, and platform collapse as key processes in propagation and communication visibility of racial discourses. We begin by delineating first level-digital documentation that digitally captures local campus and national events from second-level digital documentation - the copying of already digitized content (e.g., via screenshotting). We then introduce the concept of 'platform collapse' - second-level digital documentation that enables mediated spillover of content in ways that disrupt discourse architectures, affordances, and audience contexts. Platform collapse emerged in student discussions of how content was documented and moved from relatively private to more public spaces to call attention to racist events, messages, and behavior, and to spur conversations and action. This extended reach and frequency, and also changed the context of racial discourses. Conversely, there was also evidence of platform collapse where content was moved from public to more private spaces to address social groundlessness and avoid masspersonal engagement on social media. We conclude by discussing implications of digital documentation and platform collapse for communication theory and methods.","[Bigman, Cabral A.] Univ Illinois, Dept Commun, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Planey, Arrianna Marie] Univ N Carolina, Gillings Sch Global Publ Hlth, Dept Hlth Policy & Management, Chapel Hill, NC 27515 USA; [Williamson, Lillie D.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Commun Arts, Madison, WI USA; [Smith, Marisa A.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Advertising Publ Relat, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Smith, Sharde McNeil] Univ Illinois, Dept Human Dev & Family Studies, Urbana, IL 61801 USA",,"Bigman, CA (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Coll Liberal Arts & Sci, Dept Commun, Lincoln Hall,702 S Wright St, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",cbigman@illinois.edu,,"Planey, Arrianna Marie/0000-0003-4739-090X; Williamson, Lillie/0000-0001-5735-1416; Smith, Marisa/0000-0001-8517-4998; McNeil Smith, Sharde/0000-0002-9310-2369; Bigman, Cabral/0000-0002-4510-7878",Funding Initiative for Multiracial Democracy at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,Funding Initiative for Multiracial Democracy at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,This research was supported by the Funding Initiative for Multiracial Democracy at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

Considering the fundamental transformations of the media ecology brought about by digitization and the advent of social media, it has been assumed that journalists are more or less compelled to reinvent their professional role and identity. We know a good deal about how social media is adopted by journalists, mostly through survey and interview studies investigating self-perceptions of identity in terms of norms and values. There are also some case studies, predominantly in the form of (quantitative) content analyses, exploring the (innovative) uses of Twitter. However, we still have little knowledge about how the professional identity of journalists is discursively constructed-how, in specific detail, traditional norms and ideals are discursively reinforced or challenged-in the Twitter flow. With a discourse theoretical and methodological approach, this article aims to contribute to our understanding of the discursive construction of professional identity on Twitter by qualitatively analyzing tweets from the most widely followed journalist in Sweden. The analysis of the most active j-tweeter can yield important clues as to what journalism may be in the process of becoming. The article identifies discourses that (1) reinforce the watchdog identity, (2) challenge the watchdog identity, (3) reinforce the disseminator/explicator identity, and (4) reinforce transparency but challenge professional identity. It concludes that the reinvented journalistic identity includes discursive processes that both shape and are shaped by Twitter in a dialectical relationship.","[Olausson, Ulrika] Jonkoping Univ, Sch Educ & Commun, Jonkoping, Sweden",,"Olausson, U (corresponding author), Jonkoping Univ, Sch Educ & Commun, Jonkoping, Sweden.",ulrika.olausson@ju.se,,,Swedish Research Council,Swedish Research Council(Swedish Research CouncilEuropean Commission),This work was supported by The Swedish Research Council.,,49,30,30,2,31,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

What is behind this interdependence, and how does it manifest in news texts? We argue that social media platforms (and Twitter in particular) have situated themselves as purveyors of legitimated content, a projection that journalists have not fully challenged and at times abetted. Instead, journalists rely on these platforms both for access to powerful users and as conduits to surface the words of 'ordinary people.' This practice treats tweets more like content, an interchangeable building block of news, than like sources, whose ideas and messages must be verified. Using a corpus of U.S. news stories with tweets in them, we provide empirical evidence for our argument of the power of platforms to legitimate speech and shape journalism. This study illuminates journalists' role in transferring some of the press's authority to Twitter, thereby shaping the participants in and content of public deliberation.","[Molyneux, Logan] Temple Univ, Klein Coll Media & Commun, 2020 N 13th St, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA; [McGregor, Shannon C.] Univ N Carolina, Hussman Sch Journalism & Media, Chapel Hill, NC 27515 USA",,"Molyneux, L (corresponding author), Temple Univ, Klein Coll Media & Commun, 2020 N 13th St, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA.",logan@temple.edu,"Molyneux, Logan/I-9791-2019","Molyneux, Logan/0000-0001-7382-3065; McGregor, Shannon/0000-0002-3275-0397",,,,,60,5,6,6,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

This study addresses a gap in the literature on citizen-initiated peace communication in the context of interstate relations, conflict and public diplomacy, with a focus on the understudied case of media flows between India and Pakistan, two nuclear-armed nations embroiled in perpetual enmity since the 1947 Partition. Revolutions in ICTs led to a shift in the dominant media flow from top-down and statist to bottom-up, with horizontal media flows fostered by individuals and groups now on social media platforms that opened up space for civil discourse. Dozens of different online citizen groups promoting peace on Facebook, YouTube and other platforms lead to the conclusion that peace communication in cross-border media flows indeed may have the potential to result in peace dividends in the form of fostering civil communication in shared values, culture, and collective well-being.","[Kumar, Anup] Cleveland State Univ, Sch Commun, Cleveland, OH 44115 USA; [Semetko, Holli A.] Emory Univ, Polit Sci, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA",,"Semetko, HA (corresponding author), Emory Univ, Polit Sci, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA.",holli.semetko@emory.edu,,"Semetko, Holli/0000-0002-8383-7919",,,,,73,3,3,0,16,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0021-9916,1460-2466,,J COMMUN,J.

Artists, however, are not necessarily perceived as political actors and are heard for their political activism only through a legitimacy cross-over from artistic field to political field. In this paper, therefore, we theorize that audience attention has become an important resource for political legitimacy and study how a set of artivists are received on social media. To this end we have analyzed over two million tweets and argue that content on social media platforms such as Twitter provides insight into how people talk about social issues, such as politics and activism. We employ the methods of topic modeling and semantic network analysis to study how Twitter users engage with artivists and find that very few Twitter users are interested in the societal issues that artivists raise. Instead, the majority of tweets in our data involves attention to state prosecution, media-centric artistic recognition and consumerism. These findings indicate that even though some artivists succeed in bringing their activist art to Twitter audiences, political activism that originates from artists is rarely a topic of discussion among Twitter users in terms of its activist content.","[Weij, Frank; Berkers, Pauwke] Erasmus Univ, Erasmus Sch Hist Culture & Commun, Dept Arts & Culture Studies, POB 1738, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands",,"Berkers, P (corresponding author), Erasmus Univ, Erasmus Sch Hist Culture & Commun, Dept Arts & Culture Studies, POB 1738, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands.",berkers@eshcc.eur.nl,,"Berkers, Pauwke/0000-0002-8132-6007",NWO [NWO - PGW-15-23],NWO(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)),This work was supported by NWO [Grant Number NWO - PGW-15-23].,,49,0,0,5,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

I support this argument by examining the rise of online female preachers in the Islamist Salafi movement, using interviews, Twitter analysis, and automated text analysis of 21,000 texts by 172 men and 43 women on the Salafi-oriented website saaid.net.

Our main premise was that far-right memes are a site of interaction between two types of values: those of the far-right as a social movement and those characterizing memetic communication on social media. We studied this notion through a case from Italy: the photo-based meme genre of 'alternative calendar commemorations' that memorialize events or figures important to the far-right imaginary. A multi-modal qualitative analysis based on Schwartz's theory of personal and political values yielded mixed results. As expected, we found strong appeals to collectivistic values such as patriotism and tradition. Yet some of the individualistic values associated with memes, such as self-direction and authenticity, were also evident in the corpus. We conclude by discussing how this blend of values challenges both well-established value theories and perceptions about the political work of far-right memes.","[Trillo, Tommaso; Shifman, Limor] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Commun & Journalism, IL-9190501 Jerusalem, Israel",,"Trillo, T (corresponding author), Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Commun & Journalism, IL-9190501 Jerusalem, Israel.",tommaso.trillo@mail.huji.ac.il; limor.shifman@mail.huji.ac.il,,"Shifman, Limor/0000-0002-2616-9491",European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme [819004],European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme(European Research Council (ERC)),This project has received funding from the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme [grant agreement No 819004].,,78,0,0,4,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

Thematic and interpretative analysis have been carried out of 70,000 messages posted on Twitter with the hashtag #germanwings during the three days after the crash. Results point towards a hegemonic position of accounts connected to news media (mainstream, but also local and specialized outlets) in what regards public interactions in Twitter. However, findings also suggest that this central position coexists with an important role of the common citizen in shaping both the agenda of issues that are going to be covered but also the particular narratives and discourses associated to these issues.

Prior research on candidate imagery has shown particular effects from non-verbal behavior (e.g., smiling), contextual features (e.g., the depiction of other people), and structural characteristics (e.g., camera angle and proximity). Importantly, this study argues to look at candidate imagery as institutionalized means of political communication online. In the realm of the European Parliamentary Election 2019, self-promoted candidate imagery on social networking sites (SNS) is expected to align cross-nationally along party-family structures vis-a-vis respective imagery in the news, which is anticipated to align along national borders. We analyze and describe respective candidate imagery in both news and SNS from 13,811 unique candidates across all 28 European member states by means of a computational content analysis of 79,500 images. After a manual two-step validation, which raises concerns about the validity of the computationally assigned camera angle, logistic regression models are used to estimate non-verbal behavior, contextual features, and structural characteristics. Findings show that while self-depiction on SNS includes more smiling, news imagery employs broader variation in camera angles and close-up photography. Differences are almost independent from structural influences with the exception of country alignment, which is a minor yet consistent predictor of all outcome variables. Visual computational content analysis has proven to be a useful and reliable utility for all but one variable - a call for its employment along strong validation also in future studies to allow visual content analyses also on a large and quantitative scale.","[Haim, Mario] Univ Leipzig, Dept Commun & Media Studies, Nikolaistr 27-29, D-04109 Leipzig, Germany; [Jungblut, Marc] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Dept Media & Commun, Munich, Germany",,"Haim, M (corresponding author), Univ Leipzig, Dept Commun & Media Studies, Nikolaistr 27-29, D-04109 Leipzig, Germany.",mario.haim@uni-leipzig.de,,"Jungblut, Marc/0000-0002-2677-0738",,,,,65,5,5,0,15,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1058-4609,1091-7675,,POLIT COMMUN,Polit.

After the UK riots in 2011, citizen 'broom armies' took to the streets to clear up and repair damage. Different hashtags, including #RiotCleanUp and #OperationCupOfTea, were implicated in these movements. This paper questions connective action theory in this context. It seeks to respond to two criticisms of the connective approach, namely that connective action underplays differences between technologies and does not account sufficiently for cultural and ideological drivers of action. The paper combines an analysis of software systems, issue publics and discourse to giver a fuller account of connective politics during the riot clean-up movements. In doing so, it develops several metrics to advance understanding of digital communication systems, drawing attention to the roles that time and account status play in assembling meaning on Twitter. This analysis suggests that the clean-up movements were complex, discursive political acts, in which celebrity accounts played an influential role in framing discourse. Furthermore, the #RiotCleanUp hashtag credited with mobilising these groups is found to provide a less compelling explanation of action when compared against the more emotive but less noted #OperationCupOfTea.","[Pond, Philip; Lewis, Jeff] RMIT Univ, Sch Media & Commun, 124 La Trobe St, Melbourne, Vic 3000, Australia",,"Pond, P (corresponding author), RMIT Univ, Sch Media & Commun, 124 La Trobe St, Melbourne, Vic 3000, Australia.",philip.pond@rmit.edu.au,,"Pond, Philip/0000-0002-5712-240X",,,,,40,23,24,5,52,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

We elaborate and illustrate this definition through a discussion of the co-evolving relationship of journalism with the Internet and social media platforms since the 2000s and outline in detail how social news outlets such as BuzzFeed are paradigmatic examples of these dynamics and relationships. The article concludes by emphasizing the urgent need for both the study and practice of digital journalism in the public interest, especially in the context of an increasingly platformed and closed media system.

Social media platforms facilitate, define and amplify debate about this topic. They give rise to counterpublic spaces through which counterpublics such as climate sceptics get a stage they would not easily get in mainstream media. Previous research suggests that sceptics use these spaces as safe havens, but also as bases for interventions in the hegemonic debate. Applying a multideterminant frame model, we analyse the Twitter debate among climate change 'sceptics' and 'believers'. We study all tweets in which the heat wave was related to climate change and which were shared by Dutch and Flemish users between 28 July 2018 and 4 August 2018. Laying bare the worldviews underlying the frames of sceptics and non-sceptics, we first demonstrate the diversity of - unilaterally interacting - ideological interests. Building upon this analysis of the scope of the debate and analysing its form, we show that both groups mostly use similar antagonistic strategies to delegitimize and denaturalize their out-groups. We argue that these interventions promote polarization rather than a constructive agonistic debate. As such, this study refutes previous studies that consider sceptic frames as deconstructive and non-sceptic frames as constructive.","[Moernaut, Renee; Mast, Jelle; Temmerman, Martina] Vrije Univ Brussel, Brussels Inst Journalism Studies, Dept Linguist & Literary Studies, Pleinlaan 11, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium; [Broersma, Marcel] Univ Groningen, Ctr Media & Journalism Studies, Groningen, Netherlands",,"Mast, J (corresponding author), Vrije Univ Brussel, Brussels Inst Journalism Studies, Dept Linguist & Literary Studies, Pleinlaan 11, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium.",jelle.mast@vub.be,,"Temmerman, Martina/0000-0002-1482-8488; Broersma, Marcel/0000-0002-7342-3472",,,,,31,5,5,5,26,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

However, most of the research on Chinese use of social media to date has focused specifically on Chinese language Internet sources, with little attention paid to online activity among any of China's 55 officially recognized ethnic minority groups, such as the Uyghurs. Uyghurs are an ethnic group native to China's northwest Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. They speak Uyghur language natively, a Turkic language that utilizes an Arabic script, and most are Moslems. As the largest ethnic group within a region of China noted as among China's most politically sensitive, the Uyghurs provide a rich source for study of the use of the Internet by a potentially contentious group. This research thus seeks to fill a gap in the literature by addressing the question: In what ways do Uyghurs utilize social media as a form of online activism? The findings show that in Uyghur blogs, comments are often posted using veiled language such as metaphors, sarcasm, and humor, or references to traditional Uyghur sayings and culture practices as a means of expressing subversive political communication, in an indirect way.","[Clothey, Rebecca A.; Erkin, Erfan; Emat, Husenjan] Drexel Univ, Sch Educ, One Drexel Plaza,Ste 148, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Koku, Emmanuel F.] Drexel Univ, Dept Sociol, PSA Bldg 47 Room 309,3228-50 Powelton Ave, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",,"Clothey, RA (corresponding author), Drexel Univ, Sch Educ, One Drexel Plaza,Ste 148, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",Rebecca.a.clothey@drexel.edu; emmanuelkoku@drexel.edu; ea333@drexel.edu; husanjan424@gmail.com,"Koku, Emmanuel/AAA-2822-2020; Clothey, Rebecca/AAS-5833-2021",,,,,,47,20,20,3,51,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

One of the major affordances of Instagram is the creation and posting of pictures. This allows for the production of photographic self-representations - one of the central aspects of contemporary everyday social media practices. Yet, these practices, deeply intertwined with the politics of gender representation, are often dismissed as trivial. Following a feminist media studies approach, grounded in the tradition of cultural studies, this research seeks to provide a critical and qualitative exploration of how young women using Instagram understand gendered self-representational practices. To do so, we conducted 13 in-depth interviews with 'ordinary' female Instagram users (i.e., not celebrities, influencers, or 'Insta-famous' users) aged 18-35 years. Our findings illustrate how these understandings are rooted in complex negotiations and can combine contradictory discourses. They emphasize the importance of attentive curation in self-representational practices, acknowledging the influence of social and aesthetic conventions of photographable and Instagrammable. These findings highlight the tensions surrounding the idea of self-representation, acknowledging its potential as an empowering practice, while simultaneously recognizing the users' need to negotiate the culturally prevalent negative and gendered stereotypes about selfie-taking. Furthermore, it also explores the existing negotiations between the desires to engage with popular Instagrammable aesthetics, while still grounding these practices on a sense of authenticity.","[Caldeira, Sofia P.; Van Bauwel, Sofie; De Ridder, Sander] Univ Ghent, Fac Polit & Social Sci, Dept Commun Sci, Ghent, Belgium",,"Van Bauwel, S (corresponding author), Univ Ghent, Fac Polit & Social Sci, Dept Commun Sci, Ghent, Belgium.",AnaSofia.PereiraCaldeira@ugent.be,"De Ridder, Sander/AAA-4415-2019","Van Bauwel, Sofie/0000-0002-8554-2452; Caldeira, Sofia P./0000-0001-7681-6952",Fundaca o para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia [SFRH/BD/116452/2016],Fundaca o para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia(Portuguese Foundation for Science and TechnologyEuropean Commission),This work was supported by the Fundaca o para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia [Grant Number SFRH/BD/116452/2016].,,50,3,3,14,34,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

We use a most-similar case comparison within a singular instance of large-scale anti-government mobilization in Thailand to investigate whether crowd-enabled elements of movements privilege a more self-actualizing communication pattern and how they interact with more formally organized movement elements. The results of a qualitative and quantitative content analysis of the posts of two Facebook pages are mixed, but do show that crowds use different language and - to an extent - more actualizing communications.

This agenda-alignment is heightened during times of high-intensity and high-stakes mobilization.

The same literature justifies the long-term effects of positive emotions that help build lasting resilience. Grounded in theories of coping and resilience, this paper (1) identifies the emotions that people actuate to cope with adversaries and (2) evaluates the resulting long-lasting adaptation and resilience. To do this, we examined the emotions felt by Qatar residents due to a land, sea, and air blockade enforced by neighbouring counties. Accordingly, we analysed 160,000 Arabic tweets originating from Qatar between June-2017 and March-2018 using a novel machine-learning algorithm termed Weighted Conditional Probability. Our algorithm achieved state-of-the-art performance when compared with the often-used Support Vector Machine, Naive Bayes and Deep Neural Nets algorithms. Results show that, while Qatar residents experienced an emotional roller coaster during the blockade, they used positive emotions like love and optimism to cope with adversities and accompanying emotions of fear and anger. Moreover, our analysis reveals that their adaptive resilient capacities gradually strengthened during the nine months of blockade. The study supports the renowned theory of positive emotions using an advanced methodology and a large-scale dataset.","[El-Masri, Mazen] Qatar Univ, Coll Business & Econ, Accounting & Informat Syst, POB 2713, Doha, Qatar; [Ramsay, Allan; Ahmad, Tariq] Univ Manchester, Computat, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Ahmed, Hanady Mansour] Qatar Univ, Coll Arts & Sci, Doha, Qatar",,"El-Masri, M (corresponding author), Qatar Univ, Coll Business & Econ, Accounting & Informat Syst, POB 2713, Doha, Qatar.",mazen.elmasri@qu.edu.qa,,"El-Masri, Mazen/0000-0003-3574-8484",Qatar National Research Fund (a member of The Qatar Foundation) [NPRP 7-1334-6-039 PR3],Qatar National Research Fund (a member of The Qatar Foundation),This publication was made possible by the NPRP award [NPRP 7-1334-6-039 PR3] from the Qatar National Research Fund (a member of The Qatar Foundation).

In addition, we examine perceived emotions of these messages and how the different emotions affect the perceived usefulness and trustworthiness. Our analysis is carried out on two datasets gathered from Twitter concerning Hurricane Sandy in 2012 and the Boston Bombings in 2013. The results indicate that there is a high correlation between trustworthiness and usefulness, and, interestingly, that there is a significant difference in the perceived emotions that contribute to each of these.

News outlets and independent organizations engage in debunking to combat the massive spread of disinformation. However, several authors have argued that fact checkers can only be successful if they win the trust of the audience - by making their practices transparent. This article analyzes the degree of source transparency provided by eight fact checkers from different countries (the US, the UK, Germany, and Austria). The findings show major differences among the outlets studied which can be attributed to varying levels of journalistic professionalism as well as to organizational differences.

I analyze this new trend toward different sorts of political scientists using digital resources to study ideas, to outline underlying paradigms relating language and politics in these respective fields, and to consider how they could be brought into productive conversation. I then consider how such conversation would enrich subdisciplinary understandings of the role of language in politics.

While previous research on online disinformation has focused on the individual level, the current study aims to shed light on cross-national differences. It compares online disinformation re-published by fact checkers from four Western democracies (the US, the UK, Germany, and Austria). The findings reveal significant differences between English-speaking and German-speaking countries. In the US and the UK, the largest shares of partisan disinformation are found, while in Germany and Austria sensationalist stories prevail. Moreover, in English-speaking countries, disinformation frequently attacks political actors, whereas in German-speaking countries, immigrants are most frequently targeted. Across all of the countries, topics of false stories strongly mirror national news agendas. Based on these results, the paper argues that online disinformation is not only a technology-driven phenomenon but also shaped by national information environments.","[Humprecht, Edda] Univ Zurich, Dept Commun & Media Res, Andreas St 15, CH-8050 Zurich, Switzerland",,"Humprecht, E (corresponding author), Univ Zurich, Dept Commun & Media Res, Andreas St 15, CH-8050 Zurich, Switzerland.",edda.humprecht@uzh.ch,,,,,,,57,45,45,7,47,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

The economic, social and technical fabric of social media has been directly associated with the code that modulates their connectivity and constructs opaque forms of property and capitalisation. The programmability of contemporary platforms is shifting in significant respects. By describing some recent shifts in programming practice at Facebook, the paper explores how predictive and machine learning approaches arise from a constitutive opacity present in all platform ensembles. It suggests that the growth in predictive programmability can be understood in terms of an increasingly experimental interplay between processes of platformisation and infrastructuralisation. Understanding these changes in programmability might be useful in analysing the relations between large information-communication ensembles and contemporary forms of life. It conceptualises, in particular, opacity as a constitutive problem for platforms rather than a proprietary limitation.","[Mackenzie, Adrian] Univ Lancaster, Dept Sociol, Technol Cultures, Lancaster, England",,"Mackenzie, A (corresponding author), Univ Lancaster, Dept Sociol, Technol Cultures, Lancaster, England.",a.mackenzie@lancaster.ac.uk,,,,,,,43,12,12,3,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

Second, we find that people who comment on articles in the real world use more toxic language on average than the public as a whole; levels of toxicity in comments scraped from media outlet Facebook pages greatly exceed what is observed in comments we elicit on the same articles from a nationally representative sample.

For this purpose, a retweet network of Twitter communication on the Brexit debate (N = 15,018) was analyzed in relation to a survey on motives and personality traits that was filled out by a subsample of active users (N = 98). Results showed that users' eigenvector centrality (as a measure of influence in the network) was significantly related to their political interest and their number of followers, but not to self-perceived opinion leadership. According to a comparison of self-assessment and network position, those with stronger motivations to distribute relevant information tended to overestimate their influence in the network.

As most social media users share articles solely relying on the headline, this raises the question of how emerging digital media reporting - especially in the headlines - shapes the perception of climate change issues and engages audiences. Guided by the dual-systems emotion model and discrete-emotions model, this study compared emotion words used in headlines versus full text among climate change articles and their social media engagement, using computational methods. Findings suggested that climate change support headlines were more likely to use fear words while denial headlines were significantly more likely to contain emotion words, negatively-valenced words, as well as words for anger, anticipation, disgust, sadness, and surprise. Regarding the full text, denial articles were more likely to contain emotion words, negatively-valenced words, and many discrete emotions related words than support articles. A denial article's engagement was predicted by the total number of emotion words contained in its headline, whereas a support article's engagement was predicted by negatively-valenced words and words for fear used in its headline. Emotions contained in the full text did not predict support and -denial articles' engagement. Findings provide practical guidance on how to increase the engagement level of climate change articles.","[Xu, Zhan; Ellis, Lauren] No Arizona Univ, Sch Commun, 700 S Knoles Dr, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA; [Laffidy, Mary] Univ Illinois, Dept Commun, Champaign, IL USA",,"Xu, Z (corresponding author), No Arizona Univ, Sch Commun, 700 S Knoles Dr, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA.",zhan.xu@nau.edu,,"Xu, Zhan/0000-0002-6140-6421",Professional Development Funds at Northern Arizona University,Professional Development Funds at Northern Arizona University,This work was supported by Professional Development Funds at Northern Arizona University.,,72,0,0,7,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

However, these studies have focused on legacy print and broadcast media even when attempting to bring their findings into the digital era by examining online content. To date, there has been limited research, in the UK and internationally, on news values on digitally born news websites - platforms that only exist online such as Huffington Post, Buzzfeed News and LADbible, which are consumed by a third of the UK population at least once a week. A significant impediment is the complexity of mapping offline latent coding methods to fluid online content. Digital native websites are particularly problematic due to their varied appearance across platforms - desktop, tablet and mobile - and their multiple access points - via web browser, social media and App. Yet, content analysis has a rich history dating back to the clergy's examination of newspapers in the late 1600s and the method has proved to be an adaptable tool for measuring news output as each new media technology has emerged. This paper argues that it is imperative that researchers look beyond legacy media when studying digital news values due to the growing significance of digital native news websites in the marketplace. The secondary purpose of this methodological paper is to highlight the challenges of capturing and analysing news values on digital native news platforms and suggest how researchers can begin to tackle the complexities of liquid content analysis in this field.","[Canter, Lily] Sheffield Hallam Univ, Dept Media Arts & Commun, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England",,"Canter, L (corresponding author), Sheffield Hallam Univ, Dept Media Arts & Commun, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England.",l.canter@shu.ac.uk,,"canter, lily/0000-0001-5708-2420",,,,,42,8,9,0,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

In today's high-choice media environments, exposure to diverse news is largely determined by individuals' personal selection. Yet these decisions are increasingly shaped by online platforms, whose curation mechanisms may serve to expand or contract the diversity of encountered content. In a major extension of existing research, we show that positive short-term effects of platforms mask detrimental long-term effects. Drawing on a four-month tracking dataset and a comprehensive content analysis covering the online news consumption of over 10,000 German citizens, we demonstrate that even though short-term usage of platforms uniformly increases exposure diversity, long-term reliance can lead to decreases. In addition, platforms vary in their influences: News aggregators are beneficial to exposure diversity, while Twitter and search engines have a limiting effect; Facebook offers no significant influence.","[Juergens, Pascal; Stark, Birgit] Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Dept Commun, Jakob Welder Weg 12, D-55099 Mainz, Rhineland Palat, Germany",,"Jurgens, P (corresponding author), Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Dept Commun, Jakob Welder Weg 12, D-55099 Mainz, Rhineland Palat, Germany.",pascal.juergens@uni-mainz.de,,"Jurgens, Pascal/0000-0002-6810-0011",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) [STA1437/3-1],Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)),This project was funded by Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) through grant STA1437/3-1.,,57,1,1,9,9,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0021-9916,1460-2466,,J COMMUN,J.

Yet, research on the psychological motivations behind the spread of political fake news on social media is surprisingly limited. Are citizens who share fake news ignorant and lazy? Are they fueled by sinister motives, seeking to disrupt the social status quo? Or do they seek to attack partisan opponents in an increasingly polarized political environment? This article is the first to test these competing hypotheses based on a careful mapping of psychological profiles of over 2,300 American Twitter users linked to behavioral sharing data and sentiment analyses of more than 500,000 news story headlines. The findings contradict the ignorance perspective but provide some support for the disruption perspective and strong support for the partisan polarization perspective. Thus, individuals who report hating their political opponents are the most likely to share political fake news and selectively share content that is useful for derogating these opponents. Overall, our findings show that fake news sharing is fueled by the same psychological motivations that drive other forms of partisan behavior, including sharing partisan news from traditional and credible news sources.","[Osmundsen, Mathias; Bor, Alexander; Petersen, Michael Bang] Aarhus Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Aarhus, Denmark; [Vahlstrup, Peter Bjerregaard] Aarhus Univ, Sch Commun & Culture Informat Sci, Aarhus, Denmark; [Bechmann, Anja] Aarhus Univ, DATALAB, Sch Commun & Culture, Aarhus, Denmark",,"Osmundsen, M (corresponding author), Aarhus Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Aarhus, Denmark.",m.osmundsen@ps.au.dk; alexander.bor@ps.au.dk; imvpbv@cc.au.dk; anjabechmann@cc.au.dk; michael@ps.au.dk,"Bor, Alexander/AAE-9421-2020","Bor, Alexander/0000-0002-2624-9221; Bechmann, Anja/0000-0002-5588-5155; Osmundsen, Mathias/0000-0002-6234-5624; Petersen, Michael Bang/0000-0002-6782-5635",Aarhus University Research Foundation [AUFF-E-2016-9-22]; Carlsberg Foundation [CF18-1108],Aarhus University Research Foundation; Carlsberg Foundation(Carlsberg Foundation),This study was funded by grant AUFF-E-2016-9-22 from the Aarhus University Research Foundation to Michael Bang Petersen and grant CF18-1108 from the Carlsberg Foundation to Michael Bang Petersen.,,51,30,30,11,19,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0003-0554,1537-5943,,AM POLIT SCI REV,Am.

Having knowledge about others creates information asymmetries that can be used strategically in compliance gaining scenarios. In an online text-based interaction, 66 (31 male and 35 female) same-sex dyads engaged in conversation with one partner tasked in gaining his partner's compliance. When the persuading partner benefited from information asymmetry, he was more successful at getting his conversation partner to comply with requests (42% success rate vs. 9% in the control condition). Text analysis using Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count indicates that while asymmetry affected conversational topics, compliance was linked to linguistic style - not content - as well as individual differences such as sex and behavioral sensitivity. This study demonstrates how individuals might utilize publicly available information about others in conversation to achieve self-serving goals.

Over the past decade, the platform has introduced a bottom-up process where users co-produce image repertoires that shape the boundaries of the imaginable. Drawing on an epistemology of social constructionism, we ask which visual repertoires are associated with value-related terms on Instagram. We studied 20 widely used value hashtags, sampling the top 100 posts for each (N = 2,000). A combined qualitative-quantitative content analysis revealed that 19 of the 20 hashtags possess distinct visual footprints, typically reflecting an orientation toward the self and an emphasis on consumption. We conclude by discussing three implications of our findings: the role of images in the social construction of the meaning of values, the distinction between internalized and externalized value depictions, and aestheticized consumption as an organizing principle of Instagram's mainstream.","[Trillo, Tommaso; Scharlach, Rebecca; Hallinan, Blake; Kim, Bumsoo; Mizoroki, Saki; Frosh, Paul; Shifman, Limor] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Fac Social Sci, Dept Commun & Journalism, Mt Scopus Campus, IL-91905 Jerusalem, Israel",,"Trillo, T (corresponding author), Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Fac Social Sci, Dept Commun & Journalism, Mt Scopus Campus, IL-91905 Jerusalem, Israel.",tommaso.trillo@mail.huji.ac.il,"Kim, Bumsoo/ABK-1577-2022","Trillo, Tommaso/0000-0003-2830-528X; Shifman, Limor/0000-0002-2616-9491; Hallinan, Blake/0000-0002-4696-8290",European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union [819004],European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union(European Research Council (ERC)),This project has received funding from the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme [Grant Agreement No. 819004].,,59,0,0,15,15,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0021-9916,1460-2466,,J COMMUN,J.

A manual content analysis was conducted to explore how female politicians, compared to male politicians (N = 40), use Instagram in terms of visual self-presentation, the use of masculine and feminine issues, and how this may lead to increased engagement (i.e., likes and comments). In total, N = 762 posts were manually analyzed. The study shows that female politicians receive more likes when they are visible in a picture compared to male politicians. It also reveals that male and female politicians both refer more to feminine issues than to masculine issues, although the use of feminine issues resulted in less likes. We find that some issues lead to more discussion amongst Instagram users, and that this differs between male and female politicians. The study sheds light on how politicians use Instagram and offers insights into how (female) politicians can use the platform to their advantage.","[Brands, Charlotte; Kruikemeier, Sanne; Trilling, Damian] Univ Amsterdam, Dept Commun Sci, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Kruikemeier, Sanne; Trilling, Damian] Amsterdam Sch Commun Res ASCoR, Amsterdam, Netherlands",,"Kruikemeier, S (corresponding author), Univ Amsterdam, POB 15793, NL-1001 NG Amsterdam, Netherlands.",s.kruikemeier@uva.nl,,"Kruikemeier, Sanne/0000-0002-8053-8200; Trilling, Damian/0000-0002-2586-0352",,,,,56,2,2,2,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

Three types of bias (i.e. gatekeeping, coverage and statement) were examined through quantitative content analysis. The results of the study regarding gatekeeping bias show the rate of mainstream sources affiliated to the Reformists was higher than the rate of Conservative sources. In addition, the study indicates that the rate of news coverage from the Reformists was higher than the rate of news coverage from the Conservatives. Moreover, the results indicate that the channel showed higher positive orientation towards the Reformists. Accordingly, AkhbareFori had all three types of bias in favor of the Reformists.

The paper addresses an unexplored question about this phenomenon: which characteristics are associated with higher levels of ostensive user engagement with political infographics in social media? We conceptualize ostensive user engagement as the outward-facing metrics afforded by a platform (e.g., like, share, and comment count) that serve both as means for self-presentation and shape the informational environment that others are exposed to. A corpus comprised of all infographics posted on Facebook by the four leading candidates in the 2016 US presidential campaign (N = 252) was coded for cognitive, behavioral, and emotional characteristics. We found that two of the cognitively oriented dimensions enhanced engagement, while behavioral cues (calls to action) were, surprisingly, negatively linked. The inclusion of emotions did not show an overall association; however, a deeper look revealed a candidate-specific effect: anger was associated with greater engagement on Trump's infographics, and similarly, pleasure on Sanders'. In conclusion, we discuss the implications of our findings for understanding the informational environment shaped by engagement with infographics in light of the two seemingly opposing perceptions of internal and external authenticity.","[Amit-Danhi, Eedan R.; Shifman, Limor] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Commun & Journalism, Jerusalem, Israel",,"Amit-Danhi, ER (corresponding author), Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Commun, IL-91905 Jerusalem, Israel.",eedan.amit-danhi@mail.huji.ac.il,,"Amit-Danhi, Eedan R./0000-0002-7029-218X",Smart Family Institute of Communications at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem,Smart Family Institute of Communications at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem,This work was supported by The Smart Family Institute of Communications at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.,,54,4,4,2,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

Accordingly, journalists must cope with this uneasy bedfellow and provide news on Facebook to attract otherwise hard-to-reach audiences. This is even more relevant for public service broadcasters (PSBs), whose mission is to serve the interests and needs of every citizen. Bound to their public service mission, PSBs have to generally fulfill specific normative requirements such as diversity within their coverage, particularly to a higher degree than their commercial counterparts. Consequently, these requirements should be transferred to public service online supply in general and to public service supply on platforms such as Facebook. Whereas these demands have at best been roughly discussed, they have not been investigated to date. Therefore, we conducted a content analysis of the most viewed public service and commercial German TV newscasts and their respective Facebook sites, and analyzed whether public service news outperform commercial news on Facebook and whether they perform as good as on TV in terms of diversity (diversity of issues and of people and groups). Results show that public service news on Facebook show an even higher performance (albeit slightly) than on television.","[Steiner, Miriam; Stark, Birgit] Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Dept Commun, Mainz, Germany; [Magin, Melanie] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol NTNU, Dept Sociol & Polit Sci, Trondheim, Norway",,"Steiner, M (corresponding author), Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Dept Commun, Mainz, Germany.",miriam.steiner@uni-mainz.de; melanie.magin@ntnu.no; birgit.stark@uni-mainz.de,,"Magin, Melanie/0000-0003-2545-3594",,,,,73,11,11,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

We conclude by discussing challenging new obstacles in the field, calling for increased attention to sociological theory, and identifying new areas where computational social science might be further integrated into mainstream sociology.","[Edelmann, Achim] Univ Bern, Inst Sociol, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland; [Edelmann, Achim] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Sociol, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Wolff, Tom; Montagne, Danielle; Bail, Christopher A.] Duke Univ, Dept Sociol, Durham, NC 27708 USA",,"Edelmann, A (corresponding author), Univ Bern, Inst Sociol, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland.;Edelmann, A (corresponding author), London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Sociol, London WC2A 2AE, England.",achim.edelmann@soz.unibe.ch; christopher.bail@duke.edu,,"Edelmann, Achim/0000-0001-8293-674X",NICHD NIH HHS [P2C HD065563] Funding Source: Medline,NICHD NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD)),,,138,29,32,27,78,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",0360-0572,1545-2115,978-0-8243-2246-5,ANNU REV SOCIOL,Annu.

In this article, we analyze the variety of digital activist practices (DAPs) enacted by Chilean student movement organizations over time (2011-2016). We define DAPs as proactive actions that seek to achieve political impacts in a particular context through the use of digital tools. Based on content analysis of Facebook posts and in-depth interviews with key informants, we show that movement actors have appropriated digital tools in diverse and asymmetric ways, and that asymmetries have remained constant over time. The article also shows that DAPs sponsored by organizations vary across three dimensions: online presence, goals, and the audiences to which they speak. This variation is explained by differing levels of financial and human resources, and, most importantly, by the choices actors make as they interpret political constraints and challenges in particular contexts. These choices are, in turn, informed by the political views of rotating sets of student leaders.","[von Bulow, Marisa; Abelin, Pedro Henrique] Univ Brasilia, Polit Sci Inst, Brasilia, DF, Brazil; [Vilaca, Luiz] Univ Notre Dame, Dept Sociol, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA",,"von Bulow, M (corresponding author), Univ Brasilia, Polit Sci Inst, Brasilia, DF, Brazil.",marisavonbulow@gmail.com,"Teixeira, Pedro Henrique Abelin/ABB-4699-2020","Teixeira, Pedro Henrique Abelin/0000-0003-0404-8039","Conicyt-Chile [Fondecyt] [1130897]; Iniciativa Cientifica Milenio, Ministerio de Economia, Fomento y Turismo, Chile [RS130002]","Conicyt-Chile [Fondecyt](Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT); Iniciativa Cientifica Milenio, Ministerio de Economia, Fomento y Turismo, Chile","This work was supported by Conicyt-Chile [Fondecyt Grant 1130897]; Iniciativa Cientifica Milenio, Ministerio de Economia, Fomento y Turismo, Chile [Project RS130002].",,48,7,9,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

Against the background of a hybrid media system, we pursue three research goals. First, we evaluate the scope of the Twitter-in-the-news phenomenon relative to news coverage as a whole. Second, we examine the functions of embedded tweets. Third, we identify characteristics that increase the likelihood that tweets will be selected for publication in a news article. We combine computational methods with a manual content analysis and analyze political news coverage of one month outside election periods in four German online news outlets. Our results show that embedding tweets in the news is not a niche phenomenon but has been established as a routine journalistic practice to a moderate extent. In the majority of news articles, the function of tweets is to illustrate an argument or information provided in the text. Geographical proximity and - with some dependencies - the number of popularity cues increased the likelihood of a tweet to be picked up for reporting. The paper shows how transformation processes currently observed in journalism manifest themselves in reporting.","[Oschatz, Corinna] Univ Koblenz Landau, Dept Commun Psychol & Media Educ, Landau, Germany; [Stier, Sebastian] GESIS Leibniz Inst Social Sci, Dept Computat Social Sci, Cologne, Germany; [Maier, Juergen] Univ Koblenz Landau, Dept Polit Sci, Landau, Germany",,"Oschatz, C (corresponding author), Univ Koblenz Landau, Dept Commun Psychol & Media Educ, Landau, Germany.",oschatz@uni-landau.de,"Stier, Sebastian/AAH-4394-2019; Maier, Jürgen/ABH-7963-2020","Stier, Sebastian/0000-0002-1217-5778; Maier, Jürgen/0000-0001-8301-5125; Oschatz, Corinna/0000-0003-3276-5721",,,,,53,5,5,0,1,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

We contribute to the literature on party platform change by theorizing and assessing how party performance motivates parties to change their platform in-between elections. We built a new and unique dataset of >20,000 press releases issued by 15 Dutch national political parties that were in parliament between 1997 and 2014. Utilizing automated text analysis (topic modeling) to measure parties' platform change, we show that electoral defeat motivates party platform change in-between elections.

A less explored area, however, is how these divides relate to potential divides in morality. The Habermasian conceptualization of the public sphere prioritizes deliberative reasoning as a way to solve moral conflicts. In contrast, this study argues that divides in reasoning and opinion are associated with divides in morality. To make the argument, this study focuses on the case of public debates over whether social media companies should deplatform Trump and his supporters in the aftermath of the January 6, 2021 Capitol insurrection. Public comments were obtained from a dataset compiled and released by Facebook Oversight Board. First, I used structural topic modeling to identify the reasoning and used the dictionary based on the Moral Foundations Theory to gauge moral foundations in each document. Then, I used statistical analysis to examine whether there was a correlation between specific reasoning and moral foundations. The results show that the pro- and anti-deplatforming camps in the debate are divided not only in reasoning, but also in morality. Supporters of deplatforming argue that it would fulfill tech companies' public responsibility, and protect society at large. These arguments are correlated with the care foundation. In contrast, opponents argue that deplatforming Trump violated freedom of speech. This argument is correlated with the fairness, loyalty, and authority foundations, but not the care foundation. The findings support my argument that divides in reasoning should be analyzed with consideration of morality.","[Luo, Zhifan] York Univ, Inst Res Digital Literacies, Toronto, ON, Canada",,"Luo, ZF (corresponding author), York Univ, Inst Res Digital Literacies, Toronto, ON, Canada.",luozhifan0310@gmail.com,,"Luo, Zhifan/0000-0001-5572-5680",,,,,63,0,0,7,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

Moreover, retweets can help spread a message well beyond the reach of its original poster. Thus, users' interactions with posts containing or making reference to racism or sexism both illuminate the ways individuals accept, challenge, or engage with racism and sexism online, and shape how those messages spread. Using an original dataset of 59.5 million tweets, I test how particular features of messages referencing Black and Asian women predict user engagement (retweets, likes, and replies). This analysis further focuses on messages including terms that express racist or sexist content. Generally, messages including covert racist or sexist insults have a modest positive effect on all measures of user engagement (retweets, likes, and replies), which may suggest that social media environments allow individuals the time and opportunity to contend with topics that can be more difficult in-person. Additionally, variations in engagement with tweets that include references to women, Black or Asian individuals implies that users respond differently to messages involving references to and normative images of different racial, ethnic, and gendered identities. This research illuminates how specific manifestations of racialized and gendered language referencing women, Black and Asian people can not only encourage more engagement, but also share, accept, or challenge messages about marginalized identities.","[Rodis, Paulina d C.

This study builds on the stereotype content model that conceptualizes gender stereotypes on a competence and a warmth dimension. We examine a potential double bind for leading female right-wing populists between, on the one hand, the need to demonstrate competence to succeed politically and, on the other hand, to conform to gender stereotypes of female politicians. We use a mixed-method design comprising a content analysis of N = 724 Instagram posts of leading European male and female right-wing populists and an online experiment with N = 163 male and female adult participants. This allows us to analyze how leading female right-wing populists represent themselves in terms of warmth and competence in comparison to their male counterparts and how these strategies affect participants' evaluations. The content analysis shows that female populists represent themselves as slightly colder but more competent than their male colleagues regarding their social roles and both warmer and more competent in their non-verbal behavior. The subsequent online experiment shows that the effects of these strategies on participants' evaluation of right-wing populists' warmth and competence do not differ between female and male politicians. This suggests that a greater emphasis on warm traits would not necessarily harm female populist leaders as they were not evaluated differently than their male colleagues in this respect. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.","[Bast, Jennifer; Renner, Anna-Maria] Univ Koblenz Landau, Dept Polit Sci, Koblenz, Germany; [Oschatz, Corinna] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Sch Commun Res ASCoR, Amsterdam, Netherlands",,"Bast, J (corresponding author), Univ Koblenz Landau, Dept Polit Sci, Koblenz, Germany.",bastj@uni-landau.de,"Bast, Jennifer/AAJ-3008-2021","Bast, Jennifer/0000-0001-6521-0891; Oschatz, Corinna/0000-0003-3276-5721","Research Network Communication, Media, and Politics, University of Koblenz-Landau","Research Network Communication, Media, and Politics, University of Koblenz-Landau","This work was supported by the Research Network Communication, Media, and Politics, University of Koblenz-Landau.",,78,0,0,9,10,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1058-4609,1091-7675,,POLIT COMMUN,Polit.

A little-understood aspect of this phenomenon and of the processing of online news in general is how sources influence whether people believe and share what they read. In contrast to the predigital era, the Internet makes it easy for anyone to imitate well-known and credible sources in name and appearance. In a preregistered survey experiment, we first investigate the effect of this contrast (real vs. fake source) and find that subjects, as expected, have a higher tendency to believe and a somewhat higher propensity to share news by real sources. We then expose subjects to a number of reports manipulated in content (congruent vs. incongruent with individuals' attitudes), which reveals our most crucial finding. As predicted, people are more likely to believe a news report by a source that has previously given them congruent information. However, this only holds if the source is fake. We further use machine learning to uncover treatment heterogeneity. Effects vary most strongly for different levels of trust in the mainstream media and having voted for the populist right.","[Bauer, Paul C.] Univ Mannheim, Mannheim Ctr European Social Res MZES, D-68131 Mannheim, Germany; [Clemm von Hohenberg, Bernhard] European Univ Inst, Dept Social & Polit Sci, Florence, Italy",,"Bauer, PC (corresponding author), Univ Mannheim, Mannheim Ctr European Social Res MZES, D-68131 Mannheim, Germany.",mail@paulcbauer.eu,,"Clemm von Hohenberg, Bernhard/0000-0002-6976-9745; Bauer, Paul Cornelius/0000-0002-8382-9724",,,,,105,4,4,7,59,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1058-4609,1091-7675,,POLIT COMMUN,Polit.

We consider the reciprocal perspective, carrying out a survey of news media-related content within Twitter. Using a random sample of 1.8 billion tweets over four months in 2014, we look at the distribution of activity across news media and the relative dominance of certain news organizations in terms of relative share of content, the Twitter behavior of news media, the hashtags used in news content versus Twitter as a whole, and the proportion of Twitter activity that is news media-related. We find a small but consistent proportion of Twitter is news media-related (0.8 percent by volume); that news media-related tweets focus on a different set of hashtags than Twitter as a whole, with some hashtags such as those of countries of conflict (Arab Spring countries, Ukraine) reaching over 15 percent of tweets being news media-related; and we find that news organizations' accounts, across all major organizations, largely use Twitter as a professionalized, one-way communication medium to promote their own reporting. Using Latent Dirichlet Allocation topic modeling, we also examine how the proportion of news content varies across topics within 100,000 #Egypt tweets, finding that the relative proportion of news media-related tweets varies vastly across different subtopics. Over-time analysis reveals that news media were among the earliest adopters of certain #Egypt subtopics, providing a necessary (although not sufficient) condition for influence.","[Malik, Momin M.; Pfeffer, Jurgen] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Sch Comp Sci, Inst Software Res, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA",,"Malik, MM (corresponding author), Carnegie Mellon Univ, Sch Comp Sci, Inst Software Res, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA.",momin.malik@cs.cmu.edu; jpfeffer@cs.cmu.edu,"Malik, Momin M./AAC-9404-2020; Pfeffer, Juergen/H-7926-2013","Malik, Momin M./0000-0002-4871-0429; Pfeffer, Juergen/0000-0002-1677-150X",,,,,95,26,26,4,28,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

Networked publics, as agents of this field, are competing overpower by performing networked practices. To investigate this field, we focused on two networked practices: networked framing and narrating. Persian Twitter in 2017 presidential election provides a good context to analyze how such a field is constituted. Combining a social-network analytic approach with discursive and textual interpretations, we analyzed a corpus of 2,596,284 tweets. We identified three main networked publics in the retweet network: reformists, conservatives, and diaspora users. Having identified the most influential users in each community based on PageRank metric, we thoroughly investigated all of their tweets. The results show that ordinary users constituted the major population of conservative and diaspora publics. The reformist community included mostly journalists and to a lesser extent media. Findings also confirm that all networked publics used the same strategies to gain more power in the field. They produced quite the same frames and narratives to compete with each other. Moreover, the battle was more about the routine and electoral debates, not the legitimacy or entity of regime. Hence, none of the networked publics challenged the hegemonic discourse in Iran significantly.","[Kermani, Hossein] Univ Vienna, A-1010 Vienna, Austria; [Tafreshi, Amirali] Univ Tehran, Tehran, Iran",,"Kermani, H (corresponding author), Univ Vienna, A-1010 Vienna, Austria.",Hossein.Kermani@univie.ac.at,,"Tafreshi, Amirali/0000-0003-0252-4396; Kermani, Hossein/0000-0002-6626-1364",,,,,72,0,0,5,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

The focus of attention is political humour on the r/HongKong subreddit, specifically the posts pertinent to the ongoing boycott movement of multiple companies consequent upon their actions in response to the 2019 protests in Hong Kong. Apart from presenting the multimodal characteristics of the creative digital data through the lens of Multimodal Critical Discourse Analysis, the central aim is to discuss the functions of users' political humour online, offering various socio-pragmatic conclusions about the polyvocal participatory practice at hand. It is argued that this digital humour resides solely in the attention-grabbing form, with the otherwise serious posts performing informative and persuasive functions as they convey community members' socio-political critique. While disparaging the 'butts', online users do bonding through collectively expressing their political dissent (which also gives them psychological relief) and sharing subversive ideologies. The humorous items inform and warn potential punters and tacitly call for a boycott of the companies that bow to the regime, all in an act of solidarity with Hong Kong protesters.","[Dynel, Marta; Poppi, Fabio Indio Massimo] Univ Lodz, Inst English Studies, Dept Pragmat, Ul Pomorska 171-173, PL-90236 Lodz, Poland; [Poppi, Fabio Indio Massimo] Sechenov Univ, Inst Linguist & Intercultural Commun, Moscow, Russia",,"Dynel, M (corresponding author), Univ Lodz, Inst English Studies, Dept Pragmat, Ul Pomorska 171-173, PL-90236 Lodz, Poland.",marta.dynel@yahoo.com,"Dynel, Marta/O-6261-2018; Poppi, Fabio I.

While it might facilitate the research process, there are also concerns about their impact on journalism. Based on reconstruction interviews with 27 journalists, we first answer the primary question to what extent journalists actually use algorithmic-driven tools for research purposes. Then, we analyze which folk theories journalists create during their use of algorithm-driven tools. Results show that algorithmic tools specifically designed for the journalistic research process are rarely or not at all used. Yet, more crucially, search engines and social media, that are driven by algorithms, play a major role when it comes to the search, selection, and verification of sources and information. However, journalists are not aware of this hidden research assistant facilitating their research process. When explicitly asked, they profess specific notions regarding the use of algorithmic-driven tools in the form of folk theories, which are predominantly negative regarding the influence of AI on journalism. At the same time, there is a still a strong feeling of a professional authority among journalists who feel they are able to work autonomously of any kind of influence, including algorithms.","[de Haan, Yael; van den Berg, Eric; Goutier, Nele] HU Univ Appl Sci Utrecht, Res Ctr Journalism Digital Transit, Utrecht, Netherlands; [Kruikemeier, Sanne] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Sch Commun Res ASCoR, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Lecheler, Sophie] Univ Vienna, Dept Commun, Vienna, Austria",,"de Haan, Y (corresponding author), HU Univ Appl Sci Utrecht, Res Ctr Journalism Digital Transit, Utrecht, Netherlands.",yael.dehaan@hu.nl,,"Kruikemeier, Sanne/0000-0002-8053-8200; Lecheler, Sophie/0000-0001-7320-1012",,,,,61,1,1,8,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

However, recent theorizing and evidence has cast doubts on the universal applicability of the echo chamber metaphor, pointing out that communication effects on opinion expression are much more complex than the metaphor suggests. Using the refugee crisis in Germany as a background, the current study challenges four implicit premises of the echo chamber metaphor empirically. The findings show a more complex picture than the metaphor implies: (1) Ignoring other information sources beyond SM may lead to severe misinterpretations; seeming evidence for echo chambers disappears after controlling for news media use. (2) SM reliance does not generally stimulate opinion expression. (3) Attitude extremity moderates the effect of SM reliance, suggesting that people with more extreme views are susceptible to echo chamber effects. (4) Attitude position on the issue-at-hand moderates the effect of SM reliance, which suggests that echo chambers do not completely shield their users from the public discourse. We propose the Echo Chamber Continuum (ECCo) Model to stimulate developing the echo chamber metaphor into a theory suitable for studying opinion formation.","[Geiss, Stefan; Magin, Melanie] NTNU, Dept Sociol & Polit Sci, Trondheim, Norway; [Juergens, Pascal; Stark, Birgit] Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Dept Commun, Mainz, Germany",,"Geiss, S (corresponding author), NTNU, Dept Sociol & Polit Sci, Trondheim, Norway.",stefan.geiss@ntnu.no,,"Magin, Melanie/0000-0003-2545-3594; Jurgens, Pascal/0000-0002-6810-0011",Media Authority of North Rhine-Westphalia (Landesanstalt fur Medien Nordrhein-Westfalen); Research Unit Media Convergence at the Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz,Media Authority of North Rhine-Westphalia (Landesanstalt fur Medien Nordrhein-Westfalen); Research Unit Media Convergence at the Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz,This study was financially supported by the Media Authority of North Rhine-Westphalia (Landesanstalt fur Medien Nordrhein-Westfalen) and the Research Unit Media Convergence at the Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz.,,48,4,4,33,62,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

Such news distribution is relevant because it (a) bypasses social media and news aggregators, reaching readers directly; (b) alters the agency and control of temporal news personalisation; and (c) reinforces mobile as the locus of contact between news organisations and audiences. However, push notifications are a relatively under-researched topic. We explore news organisations' use of alerts, considering whether they attempt to integrate with existing mobile-user behaviour patterns or seek to be a disruptive element, garnering attention when audiences are not typically using devices. Through quantitative content analysis, this study examines the temporality of push notifications (n = 7092) from nine Northwestern European countries, comprising 34 news outlets. These data allow for comparisons at two levels: publisher type and national context. The study shows how the temporal patterns of push notifications' dissemination align with existing news consumption behaviours; concepts of content-snacking and audiences' rhythms and rituals are a useful lens through which these immediate, concise texts can be considered. Our findings show that news organisations use the mobile channel for attracting and maintaining users' attention, with varying interpretations of temporal customisability.","[Wheatley, Dawn] Dublin City Univ, Sch Commun, Dublin, Ireland; [Ferrer-Conill, Raul] Karlstad Univ, Dept Geog Media & Commun, Karlstad, Sweden; [Ferrer-Conill, Raul] Univ Stavanger, Dept Media & Social Sci, Stavanger, Norway",,"Ferrer-Conill, R (corresponding author), Karlstad Univ, Dept Geog Media & Commun, Karlstad, Sweden.;Ferrer-Conill, R (corresponding author), Univ Stavanger, Dept Media & Social Sci, Stavanger, Norway.",raul.ferrer@kau.se,"Ferrer Conill, Raul/G-3347-2014","Ferrer Conill, Raul/0000-0002-0501-2217; Wheatley, Dawn/0000-0002-8751-4535",,,,,55,4,4,7,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

We consider the memes as expressions of a new networked student public that contain discourses that may fall outside the mainstream discourse on higher education. The paper is based on content analysis of 179 posts in the public Facebook Group Student Problem Memes', combined with a nine-month media watch and a discussion workshop with 15 students. Through self-deprecating humour, students create an inverse attention economy of competitive one-downmanship, where the goal is to display humorous failure instead of perfect appearance. Our analysis shows that students use humour to express, share, and commiserate over daily struggles, but also that the problems related to work/study balance and mental health, are experienced as a persistent feature of student living. We also analyse limitations of meme-based publics, emphasizing processes of inclusion and exclusion through specific vernaculars of visual and discursive humour where issues related to gender, race, orientation, class, and ability are sidelined in favour of relatable humour.","[Ask, Kristine] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Interdisciplinary Studies Culture, Trondheim, Norway; [Abidin, Crystal] Jonkoping Univ, MMTC, Jonkoping, Sweden; [Abidin, Crystal] Curtin Univ, Ctr Culture & Technol CCAT, Perth, WA, Australia",,"Ask, K (corresponding author), Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Interdisciplinary Studies Culture, Trondheim, Norway.",kristine.ask@ntnu.no; crystalabidin@gmail.com,,"Abidin, Crystal/0000-0002-5346-6977",,,,,69,22,22,8,56,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

A 'retweet count' on, say Twitter or weibo, can be taken as a measure of user influence. The assumption is that when B retweets A's message, B empathizes with A and wishes to disseminate the message more widely. But this assumption has hardly been tested and preliminary evidence suggests practices for retweeting on Twitter vary. Nor can retweeting practices on Twitter be assumed to apply on weibo. This paper makes the first effort to understand the practice of reposting on China's weibo, focusing on the content of reposts in comparison to that of the original messages. A quantitative comparison is made of the frame [Entman, R. M. (1993). Framing: Toward clarification of a fractured paradigm. Journal of Communication, 43(4), 51-58; Gamson, W. A., & Modigliani, A.

The posts and reposts all refer to the issue of officials being exposed for corruption on Sina Weibo. The study finds sound evidence of networked framing, in which reposters revised frames of the source posters while disseminating them. Although over half of the reposts merely republished the source post without added content, what emerged were new communicative functions, case definitions, and a diagnosis of the consequences of exposing the cases. However, different types of user accounts drew different reposting frames, which points to a consistent paradigm between the source accounts and the reposters. The results are important for understanding the mechanisms behind the formation of public opinion on weibo.","[Nip, Joyce Y.

However, while these kinds of sentiment scores can capture the overall tone of a document, the underlying concept of interest for political analysis is often actually the document's stance with respect to a given target-how positively or negatively it frames a specific idea, individual, or group-as this reflects the author's underlying political attitudes. In this paper, we question the validity of approximating author stance through sentiment scoring in the analysis of political texts, and advocate for greater attention to be paid to the conceptual distinction between a document's sentiment and its stance. Using examples from open-ended survey responses and from political discussions on social media, we demonstrate that in many political text analysis applications, sentiment and stance do not necessarily align, and therefore sentiment analysis methods fail to reliably capture ground-truth document stance, amplifying noise in the data and leading to faulty conclusions.","[Bestvater, Samuel E.; Monroe, Burt L.] Penn State Univ, Dept Polit Sci, University Pk, PA 16802 USA",,"Bestvater, SE (corresponding author), Penn State Univ, Dept Polit Sci, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",seb654@psu.edu; burtmonroe@psu.edu,,"Bestvater, Samuel/0000-0003-0301-0100",Center for Social Data Analytics at Pennsylvania State University,Center for Social Data Analytics at Pennsylvania State University,Funding for this project was provided by the Center for Social Data Analytics at Pennsylvania State University.,,35,0,0,4,4,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1047-1987,1476-4989,,POLIT ANAL,Polit.

We analyze the reach and strategic aims of the '120 decibels' campaign, launched by members of the Austrian Identitarian Movement via social media in early 2018 in an attempt to latch onto the prominence of the MeToo hashtag (#MeToo). We argue that this constituted a form of discursive 'hijacking,' marked by a narrowing of the scope of the problem definition and a reformulation of the political demands. We draw on user-generated Twitter data and focus on geolocation markers and language clusters in order to investigate the transnational scope of these coordinated efforts. We employ content analysis to investigate the campaign's strategic use of #MeToo. Our findings show distinct clusters of German-Austrian - and UK-US-based user groups, from which we infer directionalities in the transnational spread of the campaign. We demonstrate how the initial dissemination of the hashtag was driven by influential individual nodes within their respective networks and tied to #MeToo. The results point toward transnational networking activities among the far right and illustrate emerging dynamics between progressive and reactionary forms of digitally enabled networked framing.","[Knuepfer, Curd] Free Univ Berlin, John F Kennedy Inst, Berlin, Germany; [Hoffmann, Matthias; Voskresenskii, Vadim] Free Univ Berlin, Weizenbaum Inst Networked Soc, Berlin, Germany; [Hoffmann, Matthias; Voskresenskii, Vadim] Res Grp Digitalizat & Transnatl Publ Sphere, Berlin, Germany",,"Knupfer, C (corresponding author), Free Univ Berlin, John F Kennedy Inst, Berlin, Germany.",curd.knuepfer@fu-berlin.de,"Knüpfer, Curd Benjamin/AFT-1547-2022","Hoffmann, Matthias/0000-0001-6480-3679",Federal Ministry of Education and Research of Germany (BMBF) [16DII111],Federal Ministry of Education and Research of Germany (BMBF)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),This work has been funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research of Germany (BMBF) under grant no. 16DII111 (Deutsches Internet-Institut).,,40,8,8,2,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

J,"Duguay, S",,,,"Duguay, Stefanie",,,Dressing up Tinderella: interrogating authenticity claims on the mobile dating app Tinder,INFORMATION COMMUNICATION & SOCIETY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Dating app; identity; mobile technology; social media; authenticity; actor-network theory,SOCIAL NETWORKS; ONLINE; STRATEGIES; FACEBOOK,"Mobile dating applications (apps') have increased in popularity over recent years, with Tinder among the first to break into the mainstream heterosexual market. Since mobile dating intensifies the need to confirm that potential dates are not misrepresenting themselves and are safe to meet in person, Tinder's success indicates that it has allayed these concerns regarding the authenticity of its users. This article combines Giddens' conceptualization of authenticity, as the ability to reference a coherent biographical narrative, with Callon's sociology of translation to investigate Tinder's framing of authenticity within mobile dating. Applying a walkthrough method that interrogates Tinder's technological architecture, promotional materials, and related media, this hybrid theoretical framework is used to identify how Tinder configures an actor-network that establishes its app as the solution to users' concerns, enrols individuals in using its features in authenticity claims, and popularizes Tinder's framing across public discourse. This network of human and non-human actors frames authenticity as being established through one's Facebook profile and adherence to normative standards relating to age, gender, ethnicity, and socio-economic status. However, user discourses on other social media identify and challenge negative outcomes of this framing, with normativity fostering discrimination and Facebook verification failing to prevent abusive behaviour. This case study of Tinder paves the way for future investigation into user responses to its framing. Furthermore, it demonstrates the efficacy and broader applicability of this theoretical approach for identifying both human and technological influences on the construction of authenticity with digital media.","[Duguay, Stefanie] Queensland Univ Technol, Digital Media Res Ctr, Brisbane, Qld, Australia",,"Duguay, S (corresponding author), Queensland Univ Technol, Fac Creat Ind, Sch Media Entertainment & Creat Arts, Digital Media Res Ctr, Brisbane, Qld 4059, Australia.",stefanie.duguay@qut.edu.au,,,,,,,43,75,76,12,210,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

The analysis is framed in the context of wider questions of citizenship, civic engagement and political mobilization. To capture everyday political talk amongst citizens requires us to move beyond the now widely analysed online spaces of formal politics. Instead, we focus on online third spaces concerning lifestyle issues such as parenting, personal finance and popular culture. Drawing on a content analysis of three popular UK-based discussion forums over the course of five years (2010-2014), we found that (for two of the three cases) such spaces were more than just talking shops. Rather they were spaces where political actions not only emerged, but where they seemed to be cultivated. Discussions embedded in the personal lives of participants often developed - through talk - into political actions aimed at government (or other) authorities. The article sheds light on the contributing factors and processes that (potentially) trigger and foster action emerging from political talk and provides insight into the mobilization potential of third spaces.","[Graham, Todd] Univ Groningen, Groningen Ctr Media & Journalism Studies, Groningen, Netherlands; [Jackson, Daniel] Bournemouth Univ, Media Sch, Poole BH12 5BB, Dorset, England; [Wright, Scott] Univ Melbourne, Sch Culture & Commun, Parkville, Vic 3052, Australia",,"Graham, T (corresponding author), Univ Groningen, Groningen Ctr Media & Journalism Studies, Groningen, Netherlands.",t.s.graham@rug.nl; JacksonD@bournemouth.ac.uk; scott.wright@unimelb.edu.au,"Jackson, Daniel/AAB-4092-2019","Jackson, Daniel/0000-0002-8833-9476; Wright, Scott/0000-0002-4087-9916; Graham, Todd/0000-0002-5634-7623",,,,,45,24,25,0,64,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

They offer supporters of these candidates a chance to engage with each other while being exposed to views and opinions different from their own. This study uses a combination of social network analysis and machine learning to examine how the three US presidential debates of 2016 were live tweeted (N = similar to 300,000). We find that despite cross-cutting exposure across the ideological divide, people remain highly partisan in terms of who they engage with on Twitter. The issue agendas of Twitter posts during the US presidential debates is set well in advance of the debates themselves; it is highly negative and focused on personality traits of the opposition candidate rather than policy matters. We also detect a shift in the nature of online opinion leadership, with grassroots activists and internet personalities sharing the space with traditional elites such as political leaders and journalists. This shift coincides with the broader anti-establishment turn in the US political climate, as reflected in the early success of Bernie Sanders and the eventual victory of a political outsider like Donald Trump over the seasoned Hillary Clinton.","[Zheng, Pei] Ithaca Coll, Roy H Park Sch Commun, New York, NY 14850 USA; [Shahin, Saif] Amer Univ, Sch Commun, Washington, DC 20016 USA",,"Zheng, P (corresponding author), Ithaca Coll, Roy H Park Sch Commun, New York, NY 14850 USA.",pei.cindy.zheng@gmail.com; shahin@american.edu,,"Shahin, Saif/0000-0002-7608-7283",,,,,53,13,14,2,32,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

Based on in-depth interviews, our findings suggest that, far beyond their origins as comment field moderators, SMEs now play a crucial role in integrating complex behavioral data from social network sites and circulating this data in the newsroom to align news production with perceived audience tastes. Our findings also suggest that while SMEs identify with traditional norms of professional journalism, they also work closely with staff in marketing departments and draw on marketing language and imagery when describing their work. Ultimately, we find that our SME participants experience their increasingly central role in the newsroom in contradictory and ambivalent ways, at times defending traditional professional values, while at other times voicing support for audience sovereignty and giving readers what they want. In this way, if Pierre Bourdieu's field theory suggests that journalism is structured by an ongoing struggle between exogeneous (commercial and marketing) logics and endogenous professional values, the changing roles of SMEs indicate the arrival of a new stage in this struggle - a stage marked by the deep and virtually uncontested advance of marketing terminology and goals into the journalistic field. In this restructured professional field, individual SMEs are thus left with the difficult task of reconciling, at the level of habitus, internalized tensions between ascendant marketing imperatives and residual but still-cherished journalistic dispositions and values.","[Neilson, Tai] Macquarie Univ, Dept Media Commun Creat Arts Language & Literatur, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Gibson, Timothy A.] George Mason Univ, Dept Commun, Fairfax, VA USA",,"Neilson, T (corresponding author), Macquarie Univ, Dept Media Commun Creat Arts Language & Literatur, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",tai.neilson@mq.edu.au,"Gibson, Timothy/GLQ-6090-2022","Gibson, Timothy/0000-0003-3986-8774; Neilson, Tai/0000-0002-5109-5850",,,,,54,3,3,0,0,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

This paper explores the awareness of major life events through these media as they relate to a person's belief in a just world for themselves and others. Using survey data, we find that text messaging, commenting on Facebook, and having more Facebook friends are associated with awareness of desirable events. Passive modes of communication, e.g., the use of the 'like' interaction on Facebook, are related to an awareness of both desirable and undesirable life events across a greater range of social ties. Awareness of undesirable events in the lives of strong ties fosters a lower perception of equity and justice for others, whereas an awareness of desirable experiences in the lives of strong ties is related to greater, perceived, personal justice. We discuss the implications of the awareness of major life events through new media in terms of the psychological benefits that can come from the vicarious joy and comfort one receives from other's experiences; what we call mudita and comfort from others (MACO). We argue that the long-term, cumulative effects of greater awareness of undesirable life events may lend support to social movements that seek to reduce injustices experienced by disadvantaged groups.","[Shin, Inyoung] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Commun, Milwaukee, WI 53211 USA; [Hampton, Keith N.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Media & Informat, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",,"Shin, I (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin, Dept Commun, Milwaukee, WI 53211 USA.;Hampton, KN (corresponding author), Michigan State Univ, Dept Media & Informat, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",shini@uwm.edu; khampton@msu.edu,,,,,,,61,0,0,6,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

Conceptualizing political participation as a process, we develop a typology of political participation designed to isolate mobilizing calls for action from the rest of the political discussion online. Based on Twitter data collected one week prior to the 2015 British general election, we then identify the top 100 most retweeted accounts using the hashtag #GE2015, classify them by actor type, and perform a content analysis of their Twitter posts according to our typology. Our results show that citizens - not political parties - are the primary initiators and sharers of political calls for action leading up to the election. However, this finding is largely due to an uneven distribution of citizen-driven mobilizing activity. A small number of highly active users, typically supporters of nationalist parties, are by far the most active users in our dataset. We also identify four primary strategies used by citizens to enact mobilization through Twitter: in-text calls for action, hashtag commands, sharing mobilizing content, and frequent postings. Citizens predominantly expressed political calls for action through Twitter's hashtag feature, a finding that supports the notion that traditional conceptions of political participation require nuance to accommodate the new ways citizens are participating in the politics of the digital age.","[Segesten, Anamaria Dutceac] Lund Univ, Dept European Studies, Lund, Sweden; [Bossetta, Michael] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Polit Sci, Copenhagen, Denmark",,"Segesten, AD (corresponding author), Lund Univ, Dept European Studies, Ctr Languages & Literature, Box 201, S-22100 Lund, Sweden.",anamaria.dutceac_segesten@eu.lu.se; mjb@ifs.ku.dk,"Bossetta, Michael/AAC-6991-2021","Bossetta, Michael/0000-0002-8611-5487; Dutceac Segesten, Anamaria/0000-0001-7058-2040","Wahlgren Foundation, Sweden","Wahlgren Foundation, Sweden","This work was supported by a grant from the Wahlgren Foundation, Sweden.",,44,30,31,6,121,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

Data regarding the perception of the watchdog role stem from the Worlds of Journalism Survey, whereas evidence concerning the presence of the watchdog function derives from a content analysis of 2,792 fact-checks published by FactCheck.org (United States), Pagella Politica (Italy), Correctiv (Germany), and Lupa (Brazil). While fact-checkers working for Correctiv rarely addressed declarations by political agents, those contributing to FactCheck.org prioritized verifying statements by former President Trump. In turn, Pagella Politica fact-checkers recurrently used assertive labels to stress the falsehood of public remarks, whilst true is the most used label in the Lupa case. There is correspondence between professionals' conceptions about their role and the watchdog stance agencies perform in most cases. The manuscript also discusses how idiosyncrasies featuring each professional culture and specific traits of media systems influence fact-checkers' work. Lastly, we hold that in some settings fact-checking may outline new frontiers for the notion of watchdog journalism, taking the journalistic voice to unprecedented levels of adversarialism.","[Ferracioli, Paulo] Univ Estado Rio De Janeiro, Inst Social & Polit Studies, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [Kniess, Andressa Butture; Marques, Francisco Paulo Jamil] Univ Fed Parana, Dept Polit Sci, Curitiba, Parana, Brazil",,"Marques, FPJ (corresponding author), Univ Fed Parana, Dept Polit Sci, Curitiba, Parana, Brazil.",marquesjamil@gmail.com,"Marques, Francisco Paulo Jamil/D-3343-2009; Ferracioli, Paulo/AGH-5639-2022","Marques, Francisco Paulo Jamil/0000-0002-5256-1964; Ferracioli, Paulo/0000-0001-9355-3365; Kniess, Andressa Butture/0000-0002-1337-5376","Brazilian National Scientific Council (CNPq) [310724/2020-1]; Brazilian Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel (CAPES) [001, 88887.478242/2020-00]",Brazilian National Scientific Council (CNPq)(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)Fundacao de Apoio a Pesquisa do Distrito Federal (FAPDF)); Brazilian Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel (CAPES)(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)),This research was funded by the Brazilian National Scientific Council (CNPq) (310724/2020-1) and by the Brazilian Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel (CAPES) (001 and 88887.478242/2020-00).,,103,1,1,11,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

First, in a quasi-experimental design, we asked a diverse set of participants (N=78) to search Google News using four search terms and report the first five articles recommended for each term. We found little evidence of news personalisation, which challenges the claim that news search algorithms contribute to weakened viewpoint diversity. We also found a high degree of homogeneity in news search results, with legacy media brands dominating. Second, we conducted a manual content analysis of the articles recommended by Google News for our search terms (N=192), focusing on favourability towards each term. We found that while there was little relationship between the favourability slant of the articles and political leanings of participants, there were two exceptions: self-identified right-wing participants were more likely to see unfavourable stories about 1) immigration, and 2) a left-wing politician. This reopens the question of news search engines' contributions to polarisation and viewpoint diversity for certain news consumers.","[Evans, Ryan; Jackson, Daniel; Murphy, Jaron] Bournemouth Univ, Fac Media & Commun, Poole, Dorset, England",,"Jackson, D (corresponding author), Bournemouth Univ, Fac Media & Commun, Poole, Dorset, England.",jacksond@bournemouth.ac.uk,,"Jackson, Daniel/0000-0002-8833-9476; Murphy, Dr Jaron/0000-0002-4123-364X",,,,,47,0,0,9,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

We argue that a topically heterogeneous landscape of right-wing populist alternative news outlets could maximize the reach of right-wing populist messages. Using LDA topic modeling, we explore the topical structures of nine different outlets (n = 66,965 articles) and empirically identify meaningful groups of outlets. Our analyses suggest the existence of two topically heterogeneous clusters of alternative news media: (1) core right-wing populist outlets, with around 45-50% of articles coming from topics that are related to right-wing or populist politics; and (2) topically diverse outlets. The latter group's topic selection also reveals right-wing populist partisanship, but less prominently so, while putting more emphasis on general interest news topics, such as sports, economy, or international relations. This group also includes Russian state-owned RT deutsch and Falun Gong-affiliated Epoch Times whose institutional roots, however, are only partially reflected in their topic selection. Additionally, longitudinal analyses reveal an increase of populism-related topics in both groups around the election date of the 2017 German federal election.","[Mueller, Philipp; Freudenthaler, Rainer] Univ Mannheim, Inst Media & Commun Res, Mannheim, Germany",,"Muller, P (corresponding author), Univ Mannheim, Inst Media & Commun Res, Mannheim, Germany.",p.mueller@uni-mannheim.de,,"Freudenthaler, Rainer/0000-0002-9075-1232; Muller, Philipp/0000-0002-5351-0608",,,,,69,0,0,0,0,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

Distinguishing trolls from activists can be difficult; democratic theorists have yet to adequately address how to prevent the former while remaining open to the latter. In this article, I outline a theory of democratic politics that takes space as a central element in shaping democratic interactions. Using the work of John Dewey, I draw out two key characteristics of democratic space: boundedness and flexibility. Using these criteria, I then evaluate Kinja, Gawker Media's commenting platform, both before and after trolls attacked the site in 2014. I find that in altering its boundaries to successfully protect against trolls, Kinja introduced a new problem: a lack of flexibility that continues to affect the possibility for democratic discourse on the platform. I conclude by suggesting how this theory of democratic space might shape future research.","[Forestal, Jennifer] Stockton Univ, 101 Vera King Farris Dr, Galloway, NJ 08205 USA",,"Forestal, J (corresponding author), Stockton Univ, 101 Vera King Farris Dr, Galloway, NJ 08205 USA.",jennifer.forestal@stockton.edu,,"Forestal, Jennifer/0000-0003-1153-0552",,,,,39,12,12,1,26,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0003-0554,1537-5943,,AM POLIT SCI REV,Am.

Framing these manipulation tactics as 'coordinated inauthentic behavior,' major platforms have banned culprits and deleted the evidence of their actions from social activity streams, making independent assessment and auditing impossible. While researchers, journalists, and civil society groups use multiple methods for discovering and tracking disinformation, platforms began to publish highly curated data archives of disinformation in 2016. When platform companies reframe manipulation campaigns, however, they downplay the importance of their products in spreading disinformation. We propose to treat social media metadata as a boundary object that supports research across platforms and use metadata as an entry point for investigating manipulation campaigns. We illustrate how platform companies' responses to disinformation campaigns are at odds with the interests of researchers, civil society, policy-makers, and journalists, limiting the capacity to audit the role that platforms play in political discourse. To show how platforms' data archives of 'coordinated inauthentic behavior' prevent researchers from examining the contexts of manipulation, we present two case studies of disinformation campaigns related to the Black Lives Matter Movement. We demonstrate how data craft - the exploitation of metrics, metadata, and recommendation engines - played a prominent role attracting audiences to these disinformation campaigns. Additionally, we offer some investigative techniques for researchers to employ data craft in their own research of the disinformation. We conclude by proposing new avenues for research for the field of Critical Internet Studies.","[Acker, Amelia] Univ Texas Austin, Sch Informat, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Donovan, Joan] Harvard Univ, Kennedy Sch Govt, Shorenstein Ctr Media Polit & Publ Policy, Technol & Social Change, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Acker, Amelia; Donovan, Joan] Data & Soc Res Inst, New York, NY 10011 USA",,"Acker, A (corresponding author), Univ Texas Austin, Sch Informat, Austin, TX 78712 USA.;Acker, A (corresponding author), Data & Soc Res Inst, New York, NY 10011 USA.",aacker@ischool.utexas.edu,,,,,,,57,12,12,2,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

This study explores how cancer charities provide support to women living with and beyond breast cancer (LWBBC) through their Twitter feeds. Seven hundred and seventy-two tweets from seven purposively sampled cancer charities were used to explore Twitter posts made relating to social support. Two questions were posed: (1) what type of support is positioned by cancer charities on Twitter for women LWBBC and (2) what themes emerge from tweet content pertaining to support for women LWBBC? Using a peer-reviewed typology of social support' [Rui, J., Chen, Y., & Damiano, A.(2013). Health organizations providing and seeking social support: A twitter-based content analysis. Cyberpsychology, Behavior, And Social Networking, 16(9), 669-673. doi:10.1089/cyber.2012.0350], a deductive content analysis was utilised to identify informational, instrumental or emotional social support tweets (n=199). Over half (56%) of tweets offered informational support; 27% provided or sought instrumental support and 18% related to emotional support. Interestingly, 74.3% (n=573) of tweets were not related to providing or seeking social support. An inductive qualitative thematic analysis of the 199 tweets identified the focus (i.e., themes) of support. Three themes were identified: (1) raising awareness, (2) focusing on the future and (3) sharing stories. Cancer charities predominantly use Twitter to signpost women to informational resources and to seek instrumental support to meet charitable objectives. As the number of women LWBBC continues to increase, this study provides valuable insight into how charities represent themselves on Twitter in relation to the social support needs of women LWBBC.","[Ure, Cathy; Galpin, Adam; Cooper-Ryan, Anna Mary] Univ Salford, Sch Hlth Sci, Allerton Bldg, Salford M6 6PU, Lancs, England; [Condie, Jenna] Univ Western Australia, Sch Social Sci & Psychol, Perth, WA, Australia",,"Ure, C (corresponding author), Univ Salford, Sch Hlth Sci, Allerton Bldg, Salford M6 6PU, Lancs, England.",c.m.ure1@salford.ac.uk,,"Condie, Jenna/0000-0002-0811-0517; Ure, Cathy/0000-0001-5021-1947; Cooper-Ryan, Anna Mary/0000-0002-8305-8587; Galpin, Adam/0000-0002-7699-8706",,,,,79,3,4,2,21,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

We propose a method of text matching, topical inverse regression matching, that allows the analyst to match both on the topical content of confounding documents and the probability that each of these documents is treated.

This study investigates if and how public perceptions of gig work related to platform-based ride-hailing and food/grocery delivery services changed during the early stages of the pandemic. We collected a sample of 23,845 Twitter posts ('tweets') related to these platform-based services within two-week periods before and after the US COVID-19 emergency declaration. Sentiment analysis on tweets was conducted to investigate changes in public perception of gig work. Tweet content was analyzed by descriptively coding about 10% of the sample of tweets manually along ten different dimensions (e.g., personal experience, informative, and about driver); then we used thematic analysis to gain an understanding about the public's views towards gig work/workers. We tested supervised machine learning methods to explore their potential to classify the rest of the sample along the ten descriptive dimensions. The number of tweets increased by approximately 150% after the emergency declaration and became more positive in sentiment. Qualitative results indicate that tweets about negative personal experiences with drivers/companies decreased during COVID-19, while tweets exhibiting a sense of community (e.g., sharing information) and concern towards gig workers increased.

J,"Bosch, T",,,,"Bosch, Tanja",,,Twitter activism and youth in South Africa: the case of #RhodesMustFall,INFORMATION COMMUNICATION & SOCIETY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Twitter activism; #RhodesMustFall; youth; campus activism; counter-memory; South Africa,POLITICS; MEDIA; PARTICIPATION,"This article uses the South African student-led campaign known as Rhodes Must Fall, commonly referred to simply as #RMF, to explore youth activism and counter-memory via social networking site Twitter. The RMF campaign took place at the University of Cape Town and comprised student-led protests, which campaigned to remove the statue of British colonialist Cecil John Rhodes, as activists argued that it promoted institutionalized racism and promoted a culture of exclusion particularly for black students. Through a qualitative content analysis of tweets and a network analysis using NodeXL, this article argues that despite the digital divide in South Africa, and limited access to the internet by the majority of citizens, Twitter was central to youth participation during the RMF campaign, reflecting the politics and practices of counter-memory but also setting mainstream news agendas and shaping the public debate. The article further argues that the #RMF campaign can be seen a collective project of resistance to normative memory production. The analysis demonstrates how social media discussions should not be viewed as detached from more traditional media platforms, particularly, as in this case, they can set mainstream news agendas. Moreover, the article argues that youth are increasingly using social networking sites to develop a new biography of citizenship which is characterized by more individualized forms of activism. In the present case, Twitter affords youth an opportunity to participate in political discussions, as well as discussions of broader socio-political issues of relevance in contemporary South African society, reflecting a form of subactivism.","[Bosch, Tanja] Univ Cape Town, Ctr Film & Media Studies, Cape Town, South Africa",,"Bosch, T (corresponding author), Univ Cape Town, Ctr Film & Media Studies, Cape Town, South Africa.",tanja.bosch@uct.ac.za,"Bosch, Tanja/X-3097-2019",,,,,,28,92,94,5,88,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

This study examined how journalists share news messages on Twitter. Specifically, the authors investigated whether there is any difference in linking and attribution behavior between journalists for online and prestige traditional news organizations. A content analysis was conducted of a sample of 1175 tweets from 40 journalists from eight news organizations (four prestige traditional and four online) posted during the US government shutdown from October 1 to 16, 2013. This study supports previous research that journalists are more likely to promote content from their own news sites than from other sources. The study also extends agenda-setting theory to journalists' use of Twitter. When they were not linking to their own news organizations' work, journalists in the sample were more likely to link to content on traditional news sites than on online news sites. Also, journalists were more likely to interact through retweets and @mentions with other journalists than with public officials or other citizens.","[Russell, Frank Michael; Hendricks, Marina A.; Choi, Heesook; Stephens, Elizabeth Conner] Univ Missouri, Missouri Sch Journalism, Columbia, MO USA",,"Russell, FM (corresponding author), Univ Missouri, Missouri Sch Journalism, Columbia, MO USA.",frank.russell@mail.missouri.edu; marina.hendricks@mail.missouri.edu; hc83d@mail.missouri.edu; ecstephens@mail.missouri.edu,,"Russell, Frank/0000-0001-9977-3967",,,,,57,29,30,7,31,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

Decisions about which material and which users to include on the screen comprise a new arena for the gatekeeping function of the established media. In this paper, I introduce the concept of second-screen gatekeeping as a theoretical framework for understanding the gatekeeping practice taking place between the first and the second screens. To examine this emergent practice of second-screen gatekeeping, the paper introduces an empirical study of the selection process of material from social network sites in the live-broadcast election debates on Denmark's two leading television channels, the public service institution DR1 and the commercial station TV2, in the run-up to the European elections in Denmark in 2014, drawing on both qualitative interviews with the individuals responsible for selecting material as well as a quantitative analyses of the distribution of content in the debates. A content analysis of updates from social network sites referenced in the two debates is presented that suggests differences in the selection practices of the two institutions in relation to the thematic content of the updates as well as in terms of which types of users that were referenced on the screen. The findings here testify to the continued centrality of traditional criteria of newsworthiness as well as gatekeepers more generally who continue to exercise control over which content is fit to the screen.","[Jensen, Mads] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Media Cognit & Commun, DK-1168 Copenhagen, Denmark",,"Jensen, M (corresponding author), Univ Copenhagen, Dept Media Cognit & Commun, DK-1168 Copenhagen, Denmark.",zqg706@hum.ku.dk,,,,,,,47,6,6,0,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

Part of this problem are malicious bots: automated fake accounts passing as humans. However, we lack a systematic understanding of which politicians benefit most from them. We tackle this question by leveraging a Twitter purge of malicious bots in July 2018 and a new dataset on Twitter activity by all members of national parliaments (MPs) in the EU in 2018. Since users had no influence on how and when Twitter purged millions of bots, it serves as an exogenous intervention to investigate whether some parties or politicians lost more followers. We find drops in follower counts concentrated among radical right politicians, in particular those with strong anti-EU discourse. This is the first set of empirical, causally identified evidence supporting the idea that the radical right benefits more from malicious bots than other party families.","[Silva, Bruno Castanho] Univ Cologne, Cologne Ctr Comparat Polit, Cologne, Germany; [Proksch, Sven-Oliver] Univ Cologne, Cologne Ctr Comparat Polit, Polit Sci, Cologne, Germany; [Proksch, Sven-Oliver] Univ Cologne, Cologne Ctr Comparat Polit, European & Multilevel Polit, Cologne, Germany",,"Silva, BC (corresponding author), Univ Cologne, Cologne Ctr Comparat Polit, Cologne, Germany.",bcsilva@wiso.uni-koeln.de; so.proksch@uni-koeln.de,,"Proksch, Sven-Oliver/0000-0002-6130-6498; Castanho Silva, Bruno/0000-0001-9363-4704","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) under Germany's Excellence Strategy [EXC 2126/1-390838866]","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) under Germany's Excellence Strategy(German Research Foundation (DFG))","We would like to thank Danielle Pullan, Pit Rieger, Rebecca Kittel, Leonie Diffene, Felix Reich, Barbara Zucchi Nobre Silva, Jasmin Spekkers, Noam Himmelrath, Lennart Schurmann, and Lea Kaftan for excellent research assistance, and Leo Baccini, Jens Wackerle, Bastian Becker, Ahmet Suerdem, participants of the PolText Conference at Waseda University in Tokyo, September 13-15, 2019, and the three anonymous reviewers for helpful comments and suggestions.

However, recent studies have found that Twitter reproduces existing networks and hierarchies, indicated through homophily where dominant journalistic users with high symbolic capital tend to amplify and engage more with colleagues of similar symbolic status, which legitimizes their authority and dominance in the public sphere. Still, an in-depth understanding of how this manifests and might be rectified is lacking. To fill this gap, we explore the tweeting behaviour of 356 journalists in Austria, as social capital and personal networks are especially relevant to be recognized by peers. Our findings show strong homophilous tweeting behaviour for those with high professional reputation and for men. New entrants aim more towards gaining visibility in these tight-knit groups.","[Maares, Phoebe; Lind, Fabienne] Univ Vienna, Dept Commun, Vienna, Austria; [Greussing, Esther] Tech Univ Carolo Wilhelmina Braunschweig, Inst Commun Sci, Braunschweig, Germany",,"Maares, P (corresponding author), Univ Vienna, Dept Commun, Vienna, Austria.",phoebe.maares@univie.ac.at,"Maares, Phoebe/AAD-9907-2022; Maares, Phoebe/AAJ-5350-2021","Maares, Phoebe/0000-0002-9518-7132; , Fabienne/0000-0002-4978-9415; Greussing, Esther/0000-0001-8655-5119","Faculty of Social Science, University of Vienna","Faculty of Social Science, University of Vienna","The authors would like to thank Oscar Westlund and the two anonymous reviewers for their helpful comments, and the Faculty of Social Science, University of Vienna, for the financial support provided to cover the proofreading costs for this article.",,66,3,3,2,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

In a series of semi-structured interviews, the women shared that their keen textual and visual dismantling of Black respectability politics led to a mediated hyper-visibility that their forebearers never experienced.

Research on counterpublics has focused on actors and their narrative strategies aiming at deconstructing dominant discourses. Less attention has been paid to how the interplay between actors and platform-specific functions affects the configurations and therewith also the success of digital counterpublics. Existing studies mainly rely on determining up front which topics, actor characteristics, or arguments constitute hashtag activism and digital counterpublics. In contrast, our approach allows for an empirical identification based on how actors position themselves in an online debate toward other actors and their shared hashtags. We argue that online activism is co-constituted by actors and their usage of hashtags, actor mentions, and retweets. Applying a communicative network perspective allows for the integration of semantic and relational research traditions. We combine a recently developed automated network analysis method and content analysis to analyze two Twitter debates about animal welfare issues. Our results show that among Twitter users, citizens and environmental organizations formed a common cluster whereas media actors formed their own sub-clusters in both debates. The findings emphasize the central role of citizens for the configuration of digital counterpublics. The proposed approach can be further adapted and applied more widely for the analysis of online activism and debates.","[Wonneberger, Anke; Hellsten, Iina R.; Jacobs, Sandra H.

In this paper, we argue that civil society-based feminist organizations from various parts of the world have responded to this challenge by centring evidence of GBOV in order to develop key though hitherto under-examined epistemic, cultural, and socio-political practices, which we term evidentiary activism. Using a qualitative content analysis of 82 documents produced by feminist organizations, our analysis finds that this activism has two fundamental components. First, feminist organizations engage with existing formal evidentiary cultures by advancing and critiquing legislative and regulatory reforms to address GBOV, platform-based technological 'solutions,' and conventional notions of user privacy and anonymity. Second, they embrace and contribute to informal evidentiary cultures, which treat evidence as a tool of cultural and political mobilization against GBOV through strategies of publicization, moral pollution, and the cultivation of feminist digital citizenship. We contend that, akin to evidence-based advocacy that is influential in the fields of biomedicine and health, feminist organizations participate in and invent modes of digitally-oriented evidentiary activism designed to combat GBOV. Feminists' recasting of the how, why, and what of evidence represents a noteworthy development in struggles against online violence and misogyny, and within digital culture more generally.","[Kurasawa, Fuyuki; Kilicaslan, Gulay] York Univ, Dept Sociol, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Rondinelli, Elisabeth] Acadia Univ, Dept Sociol, Wolfville, NS, Canada",,"Kurasawa, F (corresponding author), York Univ, Dept Sociol, Toronto, ON, Canada.",kurasawa@yorku.ca; elisabeth.rondinelli@acadiau.ca; gulayk@yorku.ca,,,"York University, York Research Chair Grant; Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada","York University, York Research Chair Grant; Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC))","This work was supported by York University, York Research Chair Grant; Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada [Insight Grant].",,61,2,2,6,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

Combining insights from democratic theory, computer science and law, the article makes suggestions for design principles and explores the potential and possible limits of diversity sensitive design'.","[Helberger, Natali] Univ Amsterdam, Inst Informat Law, Informat, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Karppinen, Kari] Univ Helsinki, Dept Social Res, Media & Commun Studies, Helsinki, Finland; [D'Acunto, Lucia] TNO, Informat Technol & Serv, The Hague, Netherlands",,"Helberger, N (corresponding author), Univ Amsterdam, Inst Informat Law, Informat, Amsterdam, Netherlands.",n.helberger@uva.nl; kari.karppinen@helsinki.fi; lucia.dacunto@tno.nl,,"Helberger, Natali/0000-0003-1652-0580; Karppinen, Kari/0000-0001-6394-367X",European Research Council [638514],European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC)European Commission),This work was partly supported by the European Research Council under Grant 638514 (PersoNews).,,70,81,81,12,57,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

In today's age of social media and smartphones, this health risk has taken on new forms and extended its reach. Strategies to reduce the prevalence of and negative consequences associated with both traditional bullying and cyberbullying require knowledge of victims' lived experiences as well as the coping strategies they employ - both effectively and ineffectively - to respond to their tormentors. This article presents findings from an in-depth content analysis of the entire set of 1094 comments from a viral blog post about cyberbullying in which people shared their personal stories of bullying and coping. These stories included a mix of both traditional and online forms of victimization, as well as more general reflections about the distinct qualities of networked publics that serve to magnify, spread, and exacerbate the effects of bullying. The findings suggest that victims of both traditional bullying and cyberbullying are often targeted because they do not conform in one way or another to mainstream norms and values. Victims employed similar coping strategies to respond to their online and offline tormentors. Common behavioral strategies included seeking social support, ignoring/blocking, and finding a creative or expressive outlet. The two most commonly cited cognitive strategies were self-talk and taking the bully's perspective. Not all strategies were judged to be effective. The findings have relevance to researchers seeking to understand bullying from the perspective of victims and to practitioners seeking to develop effective interventions to support bullying victims.","[Davis, Katie; Randall, David P.; Ambrose, Anthony; Orand, Mania] Univ Washington, Informat Sch, Seattle, WA 98115 USA",,"Davis, K (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Informat Sch, Mary Gates Hall,Suite 370,Box 352840, Seattle, WA 98115 USA.",kdavis78@uw.edu; dpr47@uw.edu; anthonyambrose@live.com; orand@uw.edu,,"Davis, Katie/0000-0001-8794-8651",,,,,74,19,19,2,255,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

Our findings reveal that the 10 most influential bots in our dataset all presented an anti-immigration viewpoint, and both posted original tweets and retweeted other bot accounts' tweets to give a false sense of authenticity and anti-immigration consensus. Bots' messages relied heavily on negative emotional appeals by spreading harassing language and disinformation likely intended to evoke fear toward immigrants. Such accounts also employed polarizing language to entrench political group identity and provoke partisanship.

Building on the theoretical concept of networked flak, the findings indicate that Instagram memes which mention CNN and Fox News are often politically polarizing and largely critical of these two news channels, especially CNN (25.4%) and to a lesser extent Fox News (15.6%).

I draw empirical evidence from a cross-media computational text analysis of TV news and Twitter discourse in the 2016 American election. The study uncovers the dynamic utilization of time and its impact on the democratic meaning of the 2016 election (or the lack thereof) before, during, and after the election in old and new media. I find that a chronological temporal discourse on Twitter facilitates democratic meaning after the election, while a fragmented temporal discourse on the news media undermines the democratic meaning of the election.

Text-as-data methods are largely borrowed from other disciplines such as linguistics and computer science, but sustained, institutionalized collaboration between scholars in different departments is still somewhat rare. Using the concept of cohesion as an example, I describe how multiple disciplines interpret and operationalize the same term in different ways.

This paper examines how political journalists used humor on Twitter during the first 2012 presidential election debate. This study also explores the character of such humor, how jokes relate to other forms of Twitter interactivity, and who, or what are the targets of these jokes. Twitter use by political reporters during a presidential debate might offer evidence of a deviation from traditional reporting norms. Recent scholarship on journalism practice and new media technologies suggests that journalists tend to normalize new media affordances; journalists often adapt long-standing routines to new technological platforms. Normalization offers a solid construct to guide inquiry on how social media might, or might not, affect change in the delivery and style of contemporary political news. A content analysis of tweets posted by 430 political journalists during the debate reveals widespread use of humor by journalists on Twitter, especially associated with the retweet function. About one-fifth of the journalists' tweets included jokes, suggesting a growing acceptance of the rhetorical device on Twitter. Results also reveal that journalists and commentators pointed their jokes toward political figures, but more sophisticated satirical comments were aimed at the news media or the debate process at large. Overall, political journalists tended to avoid humor as a means of criticism. Implications regarding the role of humor in politics, the nature of reporting on Twitter, and areas of potential future research are discussed.","[Mourao, Rachel; Vasudevan, Krishnan] Univ Texas Austin, Moody Coll Commun, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Diehl, Trevor] Univ Vienna, Dept Commun, A-1010 Vienna, Austria",,"Mourao, R (corresponding author), Univ Texas Austin, Moody Coll Commun, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",helmourao@gmail.com; trevor.diehl@univie.ac.at; krishnan.vasudevan@gmail.com,,"Mourao, Rachel/0000-0001-8229-7247",,,,,36,19,19,0,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

Findings reveal that AI-related discourse on WeChat is surprisingly similar to that on People's Daily Online.

This is done through a discursive analysis of rights-claims originating in a YouTube video depicting a young boy, who is denied broccoli at a refugee detainment and repatriation centre in Denmark. Besides the video the data consists of digital views and comments, texts sourced from citizen media publications, social media sites, digitally born and mainstream media. We make a distinction between alternative/citizen media, digitally born and mainstream media to examine how different types of media play a role in discursively constructing populist logics. Our key findings show that alternative/citizen media forward political acts and rights-claims for the people by the people, whereas mainstream media generally invite elite sources to speak for the people. Finally, digitally born media encompass elements of both, thus questioning journalistic boundaries. The networked media thereby produce the discursive construction of the rights of the people as an empty signifier.","[Roslyng, Mette Marie; Blaagaard, Bolette B.] Aalborg Univ, Copenhagen, Denmark",,"Roslyng, MM (corresponding author), Aalborg Univ, Copenhagen, Denmark.",mmroslyng@hum.aau.dk,,"Roslyng, Mette Marie/0000-0001-9480-6969",,,,,42,0,0,0,0,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

However, what is meant by the 'subject' is not neutral and subjectification can differ according to cultural context. This study takes Middle Eastern women influencers' subjectification on TikTok as a case to illustrate postdigital transnational subjectification. The novel framework of feminist postdigital transnational inquiry is applied to the corpus assisted study of three Middle Eastern women influencers' short-form TikTok videos. The findings reveal observable audio-visual elements while embedding conceptual meanings surrounding subjectification. Discussion postulates subjectification on TikTok as living postdigital practices with transnational meanings both within and beyond their immediate context. It is suggested that subjectification could occur beyond regional, generational, traditional, fixed or essentialist terms. Theorising offers nuanced insights into the curatorial potential of TikTok for subjectification as consecutively interdependent with contextual issues, trends and deeper traditional audio-visual ontologies. At the same time, it suggests that platforms' transnational affordances in Global South contexts occur independently to Northcentric frameworks and interpretations.","[Hurley, Zoe] Zayed Univ, Coll Commun & Media Sci, Dubai, U Arab Emirates",,"Hurley, Z (corresponding author), Zayed Univ, Dubai, U Arab Emirates.",zoe.hurley@zu.ac.ae,"Hurley, Zoe/AFS-0568-2022","Hurley, Zoe/0000-0002-9870-8677",,,,,54,0,0,5,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

I argue that where governments provide Internet access, surveillance of digital information exchange can provide intelligence that enables the use of more targeted forms of repression, in particular in areas not fully controlled by the regime. Increasing restrictions on Internet accessibility can impede opposition organization, but they limit access to information on precise targets, resulting in an increase in untargeted repression. I present new data on killings in the Syrian conflict that distinguish between targeted and untargeted events, using supervised text classification. I find that higher levels of Internet accessibility are associated with increases in targeted repression, whereas areas with limited access experience more indiscriminate campaigns of violence. The results offer important implications on how governments incorporate the selective access to communication technology into their strategies of coercion.","[Gohdes, Anita R.] Hertie Sch Governance, Int & Cyber Secur, Friedrichstr 180, D-10117 Berlin, Germany",,"Gohdes, AR (corresponding author), Hertie Sch Governance, Int & Cyber Secur, Friedrichstr 180, D-10117 Berlin, Germany.",gohdes@hertie-school.org,,"Gohdes, Anita R./0000-0001-7367-8646",,,,,52,23,23,2,23,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0092-5853,1540-5907,,AM J POLIT SCI,Am.

The study implemented a three-fold methodology, combining face-to-face interviews, WhatsApp chats, and participant research. Results are presented from a localized appropriation notion (the act of making use of local specific media environment when drawing a media technology into one's life) identifying practices in the contexts of: place-making and geographical orientation; information access and self-help; language learning and translation; and doing family'. Hence, refugees are both emotionally attached to and technically dependent on their devices.

Our goal was to assign items in our dataset to one of 21 policy topics based on the codebook of the Comparative Agendas Project. The classification of the imbalanced classes of topics was handled by a hybrid binary snowball workflow. This relies on limited human resources as well as supervised learning; it simplifies the multiclass problem to one of binary choice; and it is based on a snowball approach as we augment the training set with machine-classified observations after each successful round and also between corpora. Our results show that our approach provided better precision results (of over 80% for most topic codes) than what is customary for human coders and most computer-assisted coding projects.

The output-a sensemaking map-is analyzed across two studies, with a mixed-method sequential explanatory design. Study one uses national survey data of U.S. adults (n = 1502) to generate and interpret an overall, aggregate sensemaking map. Study two combines this procedure with in-depth interviews of 18 U.S. adults, to identify distinct types of personal sensemaking maps and logic. Both studies point to the central role that assessments about media genre (news-entertainment) and political orientation (liberal-conservative) play in the sensemaking process. Ultimately, more attention should be paid to audience sensemaking about media, particularly as research about disinformation, media literacy, and news avoidance grow.","[Edgerly, Stephanie] Northwestern Univ, Medill Sch Journalism, Evanston, IL 60208 USA",,"Edgerly, S (corresponding author), Northwestern Univ, Medill Sch Journalism, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",stephanie.edgerly@northwestern.edu,,"Edgerly, Stephanie/0000-0002-2934-0151",,,,,46,0,0,3,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

To examine this phenomenon, we apply network and qualitative textual analyses to a unique data set of over 1.9 million tweets from the first and third presidential debates. We address two questions of networked information flow within the debate-relevant Twittersphere: who was most responsible for spreading the 'Big Bird' and 'horses and bayonets' memes, and how did they use humour to discuss it? Our results reveal that non-traditional political actors were prominent network hubs in both debates and that humour was widespread in the first debate and among anti-Romney users.","[Freelon, Deen] Amer Univ, Sch Commun, Washington, DC 20016 USA; [Karpf, David] George Washington Univ, Sch Media & Publ Affairs, Washington, DC USA",,"Freelon, D (corresponding author), Amer Univ, Sch Commun, Washington, DC 20016 USA.",freelon@american.edu; davekarpf@gmail.com,"Freelon, Deen/AAV-6040-2020","Freelon, Deen/0000-0001-5055-0316; Karpf, David/0000-0002-2761-3101",,,,,59,84,85,2,154,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

In this article, we have compared the official Facebook pages of the PEGIDA movement in Germany and Austria, in order to describe their use of references to traditional/mainstream and alternative media. The results indicate that references to mainstream and alternative media are distributed almost equally. Furthermore, when there are references to mainstream media, they are generally of an affirmative nature.

These seemingly trivial videos have been utilised by young TikTokers to advocate for various causes. This paper uses #OkBoomer memes as a case study to examine the political culture of young people and Gen Z in particular. By analysing how intergenerational politics has been 'memefied', this study delineates how Gen Z imagines and expresses a generational sentiment towards 'Boomers' as the imagined other. They do so through short video cultures and practices on TikTok, drawing upon the networked experiences of their peers.

It describes how, after securing its chief political demand, UKIP opened up to grassroots far-right politics and assesses whether this strategy involved a concomitant shift towards a more radical discourse. Against a backdrop of organisational change, the findings refine the notion that a far-right turn within its ranks led to a significant shift in the (online) communication of the party towards issues like immigration, Islam, and gender. Indeed, these issues were mostly 'outsourced' to the cultural wing of the party, War Plan Purple. The article therefore critically links changes in UKIP's organisation with shifts in online communication, adding new insights into the unorthodox politics and forms of mobilisation of the far right.","[Klein, Ofra] European Univ Inst, Dept Polit & Social Sci, Fiesole, FI, Italy; [Pirro, Andrea L.

Unable to rely on contradictory or deliberately distorted media accounts, socially interactive audiences turn to trustworthy others to make sense of the political world outside. This study uses the context of the Russian-Ukrainian conflict, marked by discordant media agendas and ideological narratives, to explore how citizens produce shared understandings of conflicting political issues. It draws upon a series of focus groups with media audiences in Eastern Ukraine to explore the socially embedded, interactive reconstruction and renegotiation of shared meaning. Based on a discourse and conversation analysis of the content, group dynamics, and non-verbal cues in the discussions, the study distinguishes three interaction modes (inquiry, narrative, and avoidance) that define the conditions for audiences' opinion formation. The findings show that cooperation in inquiry mode facilitates deliberation, the adoption of rigid consensual boundaries in narrative mode increases polarization, whereas cynical detachment in avoidance mode preserves confusion. The article concludes by discussing the implications for socially mediated meaning-making and democratic potential of political talk.","[Pasitselska, Olga] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Commun & Journalism, Jerusalem, Israel",,"Pasitselska, O (corresponding author), Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Commun & Journalism, Jerusalem, Israel.",olga.pasitselska@mail.huji.ac.il,,"Pasitselska, Olga/0000-0003-1306-2318",,,,,83,0,0,12,12,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1058-4609,1091-7675,,POLIT COMMUN,Polit.

However, the digitization of newspaper archives now allows for innovative digital methods for systematic longitudinal research beyond the scope of incidental case studies. We argue that supervised machine learning offers promising approaches to analyse abundant source material, ground analyses in big data, and map the structural transformation of journalistic discourse longitudinally. By automatically analysing form and style conventions, that reflect underlying professional norms and practices, the structure of news coverage can be studied more closely. However, automatically classifying latent and period-specific coding categories is highly complex. The structure of digital newspaper archives (e.g. segmentation, OCR) complicates this even more, while machine learning algorithms are often a black box. This paper shows how making classification processes transparent enables journalism scholars to employ these computational methods in a reliable and valid way. We illustrate this by focusing on the issues we encountered with automatically classifying news genres, an illuminating but particularly complex coding category. Ultimately, such an approach could foster a revision of journalism history, particularly the often hypothesized but understudied shift from opinion-based to fact-centred reporting.","[Broersma, Marcel; Harbers, Frank] Univ Groningen, Ctr Media & Journalism Studies, Groningen, Netherlands",,"Broersma, M (corresponding author), Univ Groningen, Ctr Media & Journalism Studies, Groningen, Netherlands.",m.j.broersma@rug.nl; f.harbers@rug.nl,,"Harbers, Frank/0000-0003-1578-7582; Broersma, Marcel/0000-0002-7342-3472",Netherlands e-Science Center [ADAH.2016.020]; CLARIAH/NWO,Netherlands e-Science Center; CLARIAH/NWO,This work was supported by CLARIAH/NWO and the Netherlands e-Science Center [Grant number: ADAH.2016.020].,,45,2,2,8,30,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

Drawing on a study of Big Brother Israel, we demonstrate how several structural-interactional features of the show encourage viewers to shift from a position of bystanders to one of confidants and companions of the contestants. We analyze this shift through the lens of mediated public intimacy-the staging of exclusive interactions in front of a third party. The emergent sense of collective complicity affects everyday interactions between viewers and public discourse on social media. We conclude that beyond the public staging of self, it is the staging and concretization of social relations in media events that serves to reaffirm the collective's solidarity.","[Kaplan, Danny; Kupper, Yoni] Bar Ilan Univ, Dept Sociol & Anthropol, IL-5290002 Ramat Gan, Israel",,"Kaplan, D (corresponding author), Bar Ilan Univ, Dept Sociol & Anthropol, IL-5290002 Ramat Gan, Israel.",danny@dannykaplan.org,,,Hammer Scholarship of the Second Authority for Television and Radio,Hammer Scholarship of the Second Authority for Television and Radio,"We would like to thank Yaacov Yadgar, Paul Frosh, Oren Livio, and Oren Soffer for their valuable suggestions and advice during various stages of this work as well as our colleagues at the department of Sociology and Anthropology at Bar Ilan University for their feedback on this project and continued support.

Authoritarian Control in the Age of Digital Surveillance,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,SOCIAL MEDIA; INFORMATION; CHALLENGES,"This article studies the consequences of digital surveillance in dictatorships. I first develop an informational theory of repression and co-optation. I argue that digital surveillance resolves dictators' information problem of not knowing individual citizens' true anti-regime sentiments. By identifying radical opponents, digital surveillance enables dictators to substitute targeted repression for nonexclusive co-optation to forestall coordinated uprisings. My theory implies that as digital surveillance technologies advance, we should observe a rise in targeted repression and a decline in universal redistribution. Using a difference-in-differences design that exploits temporal variation in digital surveillance systems among Chinese counties, I find that surveillance increases local governments' public security expenditure and arrests of political activists but decreases public goods provision. My theory and evidence suggest that improvements in governments' information make citizens worse off in dictatorships.","[Xu, Xu] Penn State Univ, Dept Polit Sci, 210 Pond Lab, University Pk, PA 16802 USA",,"Xu, X (corresponding author), Penn State Univ, Dept Polit Sci, 210 Pond Lab, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",xux112@psu.edu,,,,,,,59,25,25,4,28,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0092-5853,1540-5907,,AM J POLIT SCI,Am.

Results show parents' use of various ICTs is dynamic, reflecting developmental differences in the child and relational differences in the family system. Findings revealed that the use of ICTs for parent-child communication increased with child's age, communication with co-parent via text message was more likely among parents of school-aged children, and parents of adolescent children were less likely to use text or email to communicate with non-resident family than parents of school-aged children. Examining how parents are using specific ICTs to communicate with particular family members furthers our understanding of the impact of technology on communication processes occurring within families in today's digital age.","[Rudi, Jessie; Dworkin, Jodi; Walker, Susan; Doty, Jennifer] Univ Minnesota, St Paul, MN 55108 USA",,"Rudi, J (corresponding author), Univ Minnesota, St Paul, MN 55108 USA.",conne262@umn.edu,,"Walker, Susan/0000-0001-6663-3108",,,,,42,49,49,5,113,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

Against this backdrop, we conducted an online experiment with a diverse sample of U.S. citizens (N = 1,404) to investigate the credibility of textual versus multimodal (text-plus-visual) disinformation, and the effects of textual and multimodal fact checkers in refuting disinformation on school shootings and refugees. Our findings indicate that, irrespective of the source, multimodal disinformation is considered slightly more credible than textual disinformation. Fact checkers can help to overcome the potential harmful consequences of disinformation. We also found that fact checkers can overcome partisan and attitudinal filters - which points to the relevance of fact checking as a journalistic discipline.","[Hameleers, Michael; Powell, Thomas E.; Van Der Meer, Toni G.

Two analytical dimensions of people's media use - practice and perception - are tested on survey data from Norway (N = 1692) using a network analysis approach combined with media experience data. The study finds substantial convergence in use of different online and offline media with the largest audience overlap occurring between online local and regional newspapers and Facebook. These digital players represent the backbone of the local media environment under study. Overall, citizens' experiences with different media as democratic resources for their local public life are not very strong and weaker for online media than for their offline editions.","[Olsen, Ragnhild Kristine] BI Norwegian Business Sch, Dept Commun & Culture, Oslo, Norway",,"Olsen, RK (corresponding author), BI Norwegian Business Sch, Dept Commun & Culture, Oslo, Norway.",ragnhild.k.olsen@bi.no,,"Olsen, Ragnhild Kristine/0000-0003-3072-8046",Research Council of Norway (Norges Forskningsrad) as part of The Program on the Culture and Media Sector (KULMEDIA) [247602],Research Council of Norway (Norges Forskningsrad) as part of The Program on the Culture and Media Sector (KULMEDIA)(Research Council of Norway),This work was supported by the Research Council of Norway (Norges Forskningsrad) under project number 247602 as part of The Program on the Culture and Media Sector (KULMEDIA).,,64,2,2,0,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

Furthermore, we conceptualize intention-based IE (i.e., while looking for non-political content) and topic-based IE (i.e., while looking for different political content). In a 2x2 experiment (N = 290), we manipulated respondents' initial processing goal (i.e., political or non-political information) and low (i.e., first-level IE) versus high (i.e., second-level IE) relevance of the incidentally encountered information. Results show stronger learning effects for second level than for first-level IE. Learning effects do not differ between topic-based and intention-based IE, but second-level IE decreases learning related to the initial processing goal.

Whether from a smartphone, a wearable device or surveillance camera, video is being made, stored and shared in unprecedented ways. Once the exclusive territory of institutions becomes large enough to finance video production and its storytelling power, technology's contemporary democratization is changing the landscape of visual narrative. This project explores the discursive nature of video based on a case study of a courtroom trial that was both about the legality of filming crime scenes and the evidentiary use of videos from crime scenes. This unique intersection of surveillance, counter-surveillance, word and image, body and text allows for deeper understanding of how video serves human purposes. Based on ethnographic fieldwork and textual analysis, we build upon Walter Fisher's narrative paradigm by identifying significant attributes of unedited, evidentiary video that distinguish it from other forms of visual documentation. Raw video's hard-edged timeline presents narrative coherence in a way that resists discursive contextualization. This has important implications for public policy and citizen-generated video evidence.","[Bock, Mary Angela] Univ Texas Austin, Sch Journalism, 300 W Dean Keeton A1000 BMC 3-384, Austin, TX 78702 USA; [Schneider, David Alan] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Radio Televis & Film, Austin, TX 78712 USA",,"Bock, MA (corresponding author), Univ Texas Austin, Sch Journalism, 300 W Dean Keeton A1000 BMC 3-384, Austin, TX 78702 USA.",mary.bock@austin.utexas.edu,,,,,,,34,4,4,0,50,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

I argue that certain modalities, particularly the channel and structure of a media platform, facilitate the perception of media as more uncivil even if the content is kept the same. To test this argument, I conduct two survey experiments in which participants are randomly assigned to treatments in which the substantive content and text remains the same but is packaged to mimic different media types. Generally, audio and video increase awareness of incivility cues as well as participants' evaluations of negative, emotional, and entertaining tone. There are also differences in the extent to which individuals notice incivility on Twitter than on other text-based media platforms. The social media platform is also particularly entertaining in comparison to the other platforms studied. This article demonstrates that media attributes interact to shape our understanding and identification of uncivil language. Furthermore, it suggests that more attention should be focused on identifying the different sets of characteristics that make incivility more or less likely or salient in political media.","[Sydnor, Emily] Southwestern Univ, Georgetown, TX USA",,"Sydnor, E (corresponding author), 1001 E Univ Ave, Georgetown, TX 78626 USA.",sydnore@southwestern.edu,,,Southwestern University; University of Virginia Political Psychology Working Group,Southwestern University; University of Virginia Political Psychology Working Group,The author would like to acknowledge Southwestern University and the University of Virginia Political Psychology Working Group for their financial support for this project.,,46,19,19,2,23,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1058-4609,1091-7675,,POLIT COMMUN,Polit.

As such, they increasingly act as powerful mediators between news organizations and their audiences. The claim that search results are politically biased, while hardly new, has also recently received fresh support from President Donald Trump, who has blamed Google for unfairly prioritizing news outlets critical of his policies. In the context of elections, search engines may serve to inform citizens and have been argued to sway the choices of undecided voters. I examine two related issues: How political parties and candidates are represented in Google Search results and how strongly results in both Google Search and Google News are personalized in the run up to the 2017 German general elections. My results suggest that some parties and candidates are able to exert greater influence over how they are represented in search results than others, through a combination of local branch websites and social media presences. I furthermore find only a small share of results which differ from the mainstream, while controlling for time, language, and location, calling into question the validity of the filter bubble concept.","[Puschmann, Cornelius] Hans Bredow Inst Media Res, Hamburg, Germany",,"Puschmann, C (corresponding author), Hans Bredow Inst Media Res, Hamburg, Germany.",c.puschmann@hans-bredow-institut.de,,,,,,,67,23,24,6,25,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

In the case of Australia, a country with an official multiculturalism framework in place and against a backdrop of significant levels of Asian immigration over the past several decades, a more pluralistic approach is needed to critically interrogate the dialectic between platforms, users and wider sociocultural complexities. To this end, the current paper presents research in progress on the social chat application LINE and its use amongst the Chinese diaspora of gay men in Australia. Drawing on data from participant observation carried out over several months during late 2015 and early 2016 in an Australian-based LINE group for local Chinese gay men, we highlight here how LINE functions as an important intermediary for many Chinese men engaging with gay men's digital cultures in this context. In particular, we show how LINE plays a crucial role in Chinese gay men's engagements with gay men's digital culture in Australia by (1) mediating this group's navigations of new social and cultural environments and (2) remediating their experiences within other platforms central to the broader GLBT community.","[Cassidy, Elija; Wang, Wilfred Yang] Queensland Univ Technol, Digital Media Res Ctr, Brisbane, Qld, Australia",,"Wang, WY (corresponding author), Queensland Univ Technol, Digital Media Res Ctr, Brisbane, Qld, Australia.",wilfred.wang@connect.qut.edu.au,"Wang, Wilfred/AAX-6880-2020","Wang, Wilfred/0000-0002-6105-848X; Cassidy, Elija/0000-0001-8019-8560",,,,,64,12,12,1,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

We analyze social media and digital mobilizing to examine how, in the midst of social protest, linguistic and semiotic tools indexed historicity, contemporaneity, and futurity through relational strategies that are not just textual and discursive, but also historical, social, and political. Throughout this essay, we share examples of intertextual and interdiscursive strategies that marked particular moments of protest as articulations of historical precedents, imperial and colonial presents, and alternative futures. These examples reveal how collective identities (i.e. el pueblo) are mobilized in social protest to generate counternarratives that address structures and systems rather than locate social critiques in particular individuals and political parties. In shedding light on the intra-Caribbean solidarities that emerge over time, this analysis also points to a need to examine the erasures (Gal and Irvine 2019) performed through claims to unity and collective organizing.","[Hamm-Rodriguez, Molly] Univ Colorado, Sch Educ, Program Equ Bilingualism & Biliteracy, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Medina, Carmen Liliana] Indiana Univ, Dept Curriculum & Instruct, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA",,"Hamm-Rodriguez, M (corresponding author), Univ Colorado, Sch Educ, Program Equ Bilingualism & Biliteracy, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",Molly.hamm@colorado.edu,,,,,,,11,0,0,1,1,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0142-6001,1477-450X,,APPL LINGUIST,Appl.

Recent applications include large data sets of various types including roll calls, surveys, and textual and social media data. To overcome the resulting computational challenges, we propose fast estimation methods for ideal points with massive data. We derive the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithms to estimate the standard ideal point model with binary, ordinal, and continuous outcome variables. We then extend this methodology to dynamic and hierarchical ideal point models by developing variational EM algorithms for approximate inference. We demonstrate the computational efficiency and scalability of our methodology through a variety of real and simulated data. In cases where a standard Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm would require several days to compute ideal points, the proposed algorithm can produce essentially identical estimates within minutes. Open-source software is available for implementing the proposed methods.","[Imai, Kosuke] Princeton Univ, Dept Polit, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Imai, Kosuke] Princeton Univ, Ctr Stat & Machine Learning, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Lo, James] Univ Southern Calif, Dept Polit Sci, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA; [Olmsted, Jonathan] NPD Grp, Port Washington, NY 11050 USA",,"Imai, K (corresponding author), Princeton Univ, Dept Polit, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.;Imai, K (corresponding author), Princeton Univ, Ctr Stat & Machine Learning, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",kimai@princeton.edu; lojames@usc.edu; jpolmsted@gmail.com,"Imai, Kosuke/B-7462-2008","Imai, Kosuke/0000-0002-2748-1022",,,,,59,36,37,1,20,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0003-0554,1537-5943,,AM POLIT SCI REV,Am.

While early research preoccupied itself with the hostile nature of comments posted on such forums, and the issue of moderation, recent studies have focused on two interlocking questions: the extent to which professional news organizations, and the journalists they employ, are buying into the value of encouraging audience-members to comment on their articles and how successfully (or not) news-makers are using threads to forge virtual  communities. While the purpose of constructing such communities has largely been viewed through a utilitarian prism-as a means of drawing in traffic, building brand loyalty and generating income-consideration has also been given to threads as vehicles for empowering citizens, by allowing them to debate and/or contest the authority of professionally written news texts and/or establishment narratives. This article aims to go further, by building on an emerging strand of research which conceives of discussion posts less as adjuncts, or mere responses, to journalists' articles than extensions of them. It argues that the most valuable evidence-based posts add background detail, colour and context that can greatly enhance- and help make complete-otherwise unfinished stories.","[Morrison, James] Robert Gordon Univ, Aberdeen Business Sch, Dept Commun Mkt & Media, Aberdeen AB9 1FR, Scotland",,"Morrison, J (corresponding author), Robert Gordon Univ, Aberdeen Business Sch, Dept Commun Mkt & Media, Aberdeen AB9 1FR, Scotland.",j.g.morrison@rgu.ac.uk,,,,,,,52,2,2,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

Rather than being an intrusion into national cyber-spaces from outside, these communication networks are constructed by multiple actors, not all of whom are backed or coordinated by the authoritarian state. Diasporic actors are of special interest here. Using reposts as a direct measure of information flows on the Russian social network VKontakte(VK), this article reconstructs Russian-language networks of influence related to post-Soviet migrants in Germany. It shows that transnational communicative spaces evolve around collective resources related to these migrants by tracing how transnational and multidirectional content flow is organized between the post-Soviet space and Germany. Identifiable political sub-networks are found to be dominated by anti-liberal and anti-Western positions, ideologically and thematically compatible with official Russian state discourses. Right-wing radicals, another target audience of Russian soft power strategies in Europe, are shown to be interconnected with the publics of Russian-speakers in Germany and in the post-Soviet space. Communicative spaces on social networks are thus not purely metaphorical, but underpin the extraterritorial reach of authoritarian regime.","[Golova, Tatiana] Ctr East European & Int Studies ZOiS, Berlin, Germany",,"Golova, T (corresponding author), Ctr East European & Int Studies ZOiS, Berlin, Germany.",tatiana.golova@zois-berlin.de,,"Golova, Tatiana/0000-0002-4952-3879",,,,,66,3,3,0,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1933-1681,1933-169X,,J INF TECHNOL POLITI,J.

However, scholarly work finds evidence that congressional offices don't use ICTs to effectively listen to constituent concerns. Rather, Members of Congress use such technologies primarily for one-way communication and self-promotion, indicating a clear disconnect between the expectations and realities of Congress adopting these technologies for responsive engagement. Using staff survey and interview data collected during ethnographic fieldwork, we find that this disconnect can be partially explained by institutional pressures and interpretations of responsive citizen engagement. Congress adopts ICTs as symbols of responsiveness by efficiently responding to constituents via form letters. The language of responsiveness touted by congressional offices allows staff to bridge public narrative and institutional practice by using the same word to promote different values in constituent engagement. This disconnect leads to a mismatch between the public's expectations of how ICTs might influence communicative practices by elected officials and how such tools are used in practice.","[McDonald, Samantha] Univ Calif Irvine, Sch Informat & Comp Sci, Informat, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; [Yin, Fan] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Stat, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; [Mazmanian, Melissa] Univ Calif Irvine, Donald Bren Sch Informat & Comp Sci, Dept Informat, 5019 Donald Bren Hall, Irvine, CA 92697 USA",,"McDonald, S (corresponding author), Univ Calif Irvine, Donald Bren Sch Informat & Comp Sci, Dept Informat, 5019 Donald Bren Hall, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.",smcdona2@uci.edu,"Yin, Fan/ABD-3088-2021","Yin, Fan/0000-0002-8028-2217; McDonald, Samantha/0000-0002-7891-9792",National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship [DGE-1839285]; UCI Center for Organizational Research; Democracy Fund,National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship(National Science Foundation (NSF)); UCI Center for Organizational Research; Democracy Fund,"This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship under Grant No. (#DGE-1839285); UCI Center for Organizational Research; and the Democracy Fund.

In this context, the German Network Enforcement Act ('NetzDG') has become the epitome of the concept of new-school speech regulation: the increasing co-optation of intermediaries for governmental content moderation - with all its potential harms to free expression and democratic discourse. Contrary to this trend, however, recent legislative measures in Germany, including the Interstate Media Treaty (IMT), suggest that the country is exploring new avenues in digital intermediary regulation. Not only does the new German legislation focus on procedural instead of substantive aspects of content moderation, offering a case study for concepts promoted by recent literature on platform regulation. By introducing a positive bias for certain 'content of value,' the country also includes the role of beneficial content in its regulation. This paper analyzes the new German countermovement against new-school regulation and presents its potential impact for future regulatory concepts.","[Klausa, Torben] Bielefeld Univ, Fac Law, Bielefeld, Germany",,"Klausa, T (corresponding author), Bielefeld Univ, Fac Law, Bielefeld, Germany.",torben.klausa@uni-bielefeld.de,,"Klausa, Torben/0000-0002-6843-4994",,,,,56,0,0,4,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

Characterizing e-petitioning through the lens of platform data,INFORMATION COMMUNICATION & SOCIETY,,,English,Article,,,,,,E-petitioning; political participation online; behavioral data; content analysis,ONLINE; GOVERNMENT; INTERNET; COMMUNICATION; PARTICIPATION; INTERPLAY; POLITICS; TWITTER,"E-petitioning platforms are increasingly popular in Western democracies and considered by some lawmakers and scholars to enhance citizen participation in political decision-making. In addition to social media and other channels for informal political communication, online petitioning is regarded as both a useful instrument to afford citizens a more important role in the political process and allow them to express support for issues which they find relevant. Building on existing pre-internet systems, e-petitioning websites are increasingly implemented to make it easier and faster to set up and sign petitions. However, little attention has so far been given to the relationship between different styles of usage and the causes supported by different groups of users. The functional difference between signing paper-based petitions vs. doing so online is especially notable with regard to users who sign large numbers of petitions. To characterize this relationship, we examine the intensity of user participation in the German Bundestag's online petitioning platform through the lens of platform data collected over a period of five years, and conduct an analysis of highly active users and their political preferences. We find that users who sign just a single petition favor different policy areas than those who sign many petitions on a variety of issues. We conclude our analysis with observations on the potential of behavioral data for assessing the dynamics of online participation, and suggest that quantity (the number of signed petitions) and quality (favored policy areas) need more systematic joint assessment.","[Puschmann, Cornelius] Alexander von Humboldt Inst Internet & Soc, Oberwallstr 9, D-10117 Berlin, Germany; [Bastos, Marco Toledo] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Environm Sci & Policy, Knowledge Networks Project, Social Media Anal Port, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Schmidt, Jan-Hinrik] Hans Bredow Inst Media Res, Digital Media & Polit Commun, Hamburg, Germany",,"Puschmann, C (corresponding author), Alexander von Humboldt Inst Internet & Soc, Oberwallstr 9, D-10117 Berlin, Germany.",cornelius.puschmann@hiig.de,"Bastos, Marco/D-4616-2013","Bastos, Marco/0000-0003-0480-1078; Puschmann, Cornelius/0000-0002-3189-0662",,,,,38,15,15,2,37,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

While both bombing cases had different cultural discourses, the processes and outcomes of the online investigation were similar: there were rampant speculation and rumor-mongering, as well as false accusations and harassment of innocent suspects. The aim of the paper is to understand how such acts of mob justice happened. Using actor-network theory, a theoretical and methodological tool for mapping out the networks human and non-human interactions, I discuss two types of networks found in both investigations. The two network types demonstrate how a claim can be construed as fact or fiction through such networks of interaction.

Citizens' reactivity is increasingly important in contemporary political communication. The politicians' posts can reach the wider public through the citizens' public reactions. While we have extended knowledge about mass media reactivity, citizens' political reactivity on social media is highly underexplored. This study is intended to fill this gap by examining what type of political content can trigger reaction from followers on politicians' Facebook pages. The data contain 7048 Facebook posts by 183 single-member district candidates posted during the Hungarian general election campaign in 2014. The unit of analysis is the individual Facebook post, and the dependent variables are the numbers of likes, comments, and shares. The independent variables are the structural (text, picture, video, etc.) and substantial (content, emotional tone, etc.) characteristics of each post, after controlling for, inter alia, a general follower-activity score on politicians' Facebook pages. Results showed that citizens are highly reactive to negative emotion-filled, text-using, personal, and activity-demanding posts. Virality is especially facilitated by memes, videos, negative contents and mobilizing posts, and posts containing a call for sharing.","[Bene, Marton] Hungarian Acad Sci, Ctr Social Sci, Budapest, Hungary; [Bene, Marton] Corvinus Univ Budapest, Dept Polit Sci, Budapest, Hungary",,"Bene, M (corresponding author), Hungarian Acad Sci, Ctr Social Sci, Budapest, Hungary.;Bene, M (corresponding author), Corvinus Univ Budapest, Dept Polit Sci, Budapest, Hungary.",bene.marton@tk.mta.hu,"Bene, Márton/ABC-2637-2021",,"Hungarian Scientific Research Fund (legal successor of: National Research, Development and Innovation Office [NKFI]) [112323]","Hungarian Scientific Research Fund (legal successor of: National Research, Development and Innovation Office [NKFI])","This work was supported by the Hungarian Scientific Research Fund (legal successor of: National Research, Development and Innovation Office [NKFI]) [grant agreement number 112323].",,31,58,58,3,138,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

Since that time, selfies have been much discussed in the media and increasingly in academia. Selfie culture is gendered not only because women take more selfies than men but also because women's selfie-taking is both criticized (as narcissistic) and defended (as empowering) on feminist grounds. In this paper, we draw upon the existing literature on selfies as well as 260, short 'person-on-the-street' interviews with young people (mostly Latinas, mostly in California) about their selfie-taking practices to demonstrate that selfies are indeed a gendered genre and an important if the overlooked form of gendered media production in a postfeminist context. The data reveal the disciplinary function of the narcissism narrative for young women, their navigation of gendered and sexual double-standards as well their understandings of 'publicness' when posting selfies, their ambivalence about feedback, and their commitment to individualized notions of empowerment realized through 'control' of the gaze. We argue that self-production is never simply about the self because cultural filters are at work that shape in systematic ways how women envision and enact female subjectivity and visibility. Our goal is not to determine whether selfies are good or bad; rather, we explore what they suggest about the gendered politics of self-production for young women of color in the new 'gaze economy' of social media.","[Grindstaff, Laura; Torres Valencia, Gabriella] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Sociol, Davis, CA 95616 USA",,"Grindstaff, L (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Dept Sociol, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",lagrindstaff@ucdavis.edu,,,UC Davis Office of Research,UC Davis Office of Research,This work was supported by UC Davis Office of Research [Small Grant in Aid of Research].,,55,0,0,8,25,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

Yet despite the popularity of online news and the availability of sophisticated tools for analyzing digital texts, little is known about the relations between news coverage of human trafficking and audiences' reactions to and interpretations of such coverage. In this paper, we examine journalists' and commenters' topic choices in coverage and discussion of human trafficking in the British newspaper The Guardian from 2009 to 2014. We use latent semantic analysis to identify 11 topics discussed by both journalists and readers, and analyze each topic in terms of the degree to which journalists and readers agree or disagree in their topic preferences. We find that four topics were preferred equally by journalists and commenters, four were preferred by journalists, and three were preferred by commenters. Our findings suggest that theories of agenda setting' and of the active audience' are not mutually exclusive, and the scope of explanation of each depends partly on the specific topic or subtopic that is analyzed.","[Papadouka, Maria Eirini] Univ N Texas, Dept Sociol, Denton, TX 76203 USA; [Evangelopoulos, Nicholas; Ignatow, Gabe] Univ N Texas, Dept Informat Technol & Decis Sci, Denton, TX 76203 USA",,"Papadouka, ME (corresponding author), Univ N Texas, Dept Sociol, Denton, TX 76203 USA.",mariaeirini.papadouka@unt.edu; Nick.Evangelopoulos@unt.edu; ignatow@unt.edu,"Ignatow, Gabe/AAT-9418-2021; Evangelopoulos, Nicholas/AAB-8292-2020","Ignatow, Gabe/0000-0002-8091-6726; Evangelopoulos, Nicholas/0000-0001-9866-6828",,,,,76,7,8,16,91,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

In this article, I conceptualize a related and equally fundamental challenge for governance efforts: black box gaslighting. Black box gaslighting captures how platforms may leverage perceptions of their epistemic authority on their algorithms to undermine users' confidence in what they know about algorithms and destabilize credible criticism. I explicate the concept of black box gaslighting through a case study of the 'shadowbanning' dispute within the Instagram influencer community, drawing on interviews with influencers (n = 17) and online discourse materials (e.g., social media posts, blog posts, videos, etc.). I argue that black box gaslighting presents a formidable deterrent for those seeking accountability: an epistemic contest over the legitimacy of critiques in which platforms hold the upper hand. At the same time, I suggest we must be mindful of the partial nature of platforms' claim to 'the truth,' as well as the value of user understandings of algorithms.","[Cotter, Kelley] Penn State Univ, Coll Informat Sci & Technol, University Pk, PA 16802 USA",,"Cotter, K (corresponding author), Penn State Univ, Coll Informat Sci & Technol, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",kcotter@psu.edu,,"Cotter, Kelley/0000-0003-1243-0131",NSF [SES-1946678],NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)),This work was supported by NSF [grant number SES-1946678].,,65,3,3,15,21,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

This paper analyses the creation and movement of discourses of network exceptionalism' between advocates, online culture and news media. Networks operate functionally to disseminate ideas and link together people participating in social action (e.g. by embedding aspects of discourse in memes, which then propagate ideas swiftly), but also symbolically, inflecting discourses towards a focus on the exceptional - and essential - qualities of the internet. These discourses embed fears about the fragility and indispensability of the internet, as well as thrilling and threatening elements like Anonymous. They are carried by memes that link the structural dynamics of networked activism to the discourses of illness, threat and utility, and gain different inflections through the European campaigns to oppose ACTA. These discourses not only create spaces for discussing and expanding upon the value of the internet to communication rights, but also leave room for interpretations that may undermine these advocacy projects.","[Powell, Alison B.] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Media & Commun, London WC2A 2AE, England",,"Powell, AB (corresponding author), London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Media & Commun, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",a.powell@lse.ac.uk,,,,,,,29,3,3,0,24,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

This paper explores whether there is a preponderance of such easy data in digital activism research through a systematic review of relevant journal articles published between 2011 and 2018 (N = 315). Specifically, it examines whether computational digital methods have become increasingly prominent in digital activism research during this period. A key focus of the paper is the extent to which digital activism research focused on easily accessible Twitter data, and whether these were obtained via standard API services. Results indicate that (1) traditional research methodologies were more commonly deployed in these articles than digital methods, but (2) Twitter was the most researched platform in the corpus, and (3) single-platform hashtag studies were an archetype of digital activism research alongside single-platform Facebook studies and holistic approaches (hybrid, multi-method & multi-sited, e.g., ethnography). The paper concludes by advocating for greater diversity in terms of the methodological approaches adopted in digital activism research.","[Ozkula, Suay M.] Univ Trento, Sch Int Studies, Trento, Italy; [Reilly, Paul J.; Hayes, Jenny] Univ Sheffield, Informat Sch, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England",,"Ozkula, SM (corresponding author), Univ Trento, Sch Int Studies, Trento, Italy.",suaymelisa.ozkula@unitn.it,"Reilly, Paul J/P-3803-2016","Reilly, Paul J/0000-0002-6890-778X; Ozkula, Suay/0000-0002-1674-5491; Hayes, Jennifer/0000-0001-6805-4927",,,,,43,2,2,9,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

Traditionally, such efforts included polling aggregates, economic indicators, partisan affiliation, and campaign effects to predict aggregate voting outcomes. With increasing secondary usage of online-generated data in social science, researchers have begun to consult metadata from widely used web-based platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, Google Trends and Wikipedia to calibrate forecasting models. Web-based platforms offer the means for voters to retrieve detailed campaign-related information, and for researchers to study the popularity of campaigns and public sentiment surrounding them. However, past contributions have often overlooked the interaction between conventional election variables and information-seeking behaviour patterns. In this work, we aim to unify traditional and novel methodology by considering how information retrieval differs between incumbent and challenger campaigns, as well as the effect of perceived candidate viability and media coverage on Wikipedia's predictive ability. In order to test our hypotheses, we use election data from United States Congressional (Senate and House) elections between 2016 and 2018. We demonstrate that Wikipedia data, as a proxy for information-seeking behaviour patterns, is particularly useful for predicting the success of well-funded challengers who are relatively less prevalent in the media. In general, our findings underline the importance of a mixed-data approach to predictive analytics in computational social science.","[Salem, Hamza; Stephany, Fabian] Univ Oxford, Oxford Internet Inst, Oxford, England; [Stephany, Fabian] Humboldt Inst Internet & Soc, Berlin, Germany",,"Stephany, F (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Oxford Internet Inst, Oxford, England.;Stephany, F (corresponding author), Humboldt Inst Internet & Soc, Berlin, Germany.",fabian.stephany@oii.ox.ac.uk,,,,,,,76,0,0,1,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

In 2014, Google security experts found that 21 of the world's 25 most popular media outlets were targets of state-sponsored hacking attempts, and many journalists have watched helplessly as hackers took control of their social media accounts, targeting confidential information in their internal servers. When journalists' digital accounts are vulnerable to hacks or surveillance, news organizations, journalists, and their sources are at risk, and journalists' ability to carry out their news making function is reduced. Yet, some journalists do not believe that hacking and surveillance are significant threats, and they are not adopting information security measures to protect their data, themselves, or their sources. This research study includes 19 interviews with journalists, developers, and digital security trainers to shed light on journalists' perceptions of information security technologies, including motivations to adopt and barriers to adoption. The findings show that motivations to adopt information security technologies hinge on the idea of protection: protection of self, story, and the journalist's role-more so than the protection of the source, contrary to contemporary discourse about why journalists need to adopt such technologies.","[Henrichsen, Jennifer R.] Univ Penn, Annenberg Sch Commun, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",,"Henrichsen, JR (corresponding author), Univ Penn, Annenberg Sch Commun, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",jhenrichsen@asc.upenn.edu,,,,,,,43,3,3,1,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

A texto-material perspective on photo-sharing practices,INFORMATION COMMUNICATION & SOCIETY,,,English,Article,,,,,,photo sharing; personal photography; mobile visual communication; phatic communication; texto-materialist perspective; practice theory; information and communication technologies; transmedia; media manifold,EMERGENCE; MEDIA,"Recent changes in visual communication refer to photography becoming networked' due to the prevalent practice of sharing photographs immediately after capture via instant messaging tools or social media applications. Photo sharing thus represents a pervasive and natural activity in current highly mediatized societies. This paper focuses on communicative practices of photo sharing against the background of practice theory putting particular emphasis on the role and status of the photographic object within sharing practices. In doing so, the paper argues for a transmedial, texto-material perspective that conceptualizes photographs as objects and texts, understanding them as doubly articulated artefacts. Three modes of photo sharing that strongly differ regarding the role of the shared photographic objects are discussed: (1) sharing photographs to talk about images, (2) sharing photographs to communicate visually and (3) phatic photo sharing. This analytical systematization is followed by a discussion of the potentials, risks and ethical challenges of photo sharing and sharing economies. Summarizing, the article draws implications for the future critical discussion of photo sharing and for the empirical analysis of photo-sharing practices.","[Lobinger, Katharina] Univ Bremen, Ctr Media Commun & Informat Res ZeMKI, D-28359 Bremen, Germany",,"Lobinger, K (corresponding author), Univ Bremen, Ctr Media Commun & Informat Res ZeMKI, Linzer Str 4, D-28359 Bremen, Germany.",katharina.lobinger@uni-bremen.de,,"Lobinger, Katharina/0000-0002-1735-9269",,,,,56,25,25,3,46,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

We empirically assess the consequences of these approaches based on both a quantitative comparison of models and a qualitative validation of each method's potentials and weaknesses. Our case study uses two text collections (of tweets and news articles) in three languages (English, Hebrew, Arabic), covering the ongoing local conflicts between Israeli authorities, settlers, and Palestinian Bedouins in the West Bank. We find that both methods produce a large share of equivalent topics, especially in the context of fairly homogenous news discourse, yet show limited but systematic differences when applied to highly heterogenous social media discourse. While the MD model delivers a more nuanced picture of conflict-related topics, it misses several more peripheral topics, especially those unrelated to the dictionary's focus, which are picked up by the MT model. Our study is a first step toward instrument validation, indicating that both methods yield valid, comparable results, while method-specific differences remain.","[Maier, Daniel; Stoltenberg, Daniela] Free Univ Berlin, Inst Media & Commun Studies, Berlin, Germany; [Baden, Christian; De Vries-Kedem, Maya] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Commun & Journalism, IL-91905 Jerusalem, Israel; [De Vries-Kedem, Maya] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Swiss Ctr Conflict Res Management & Resolut, Jerusalem, Israel; [Waldherr, Annie] Univ Vienna, Dept Commun, Vienna, Austria",,"Baden, C (corresponding author), Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Commun & Journalism, IL-91905 Jerusalem, Israel.",c.baden@mail.huji.ac.il,"Baden, Christian/U-9165-2019","Baden, Christian/0000-0002-3771-3413; Waldherr, Annie/0000-0001-7488-9138; Stoltenberg, Daniela/0000-0001-9334-1514",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [290045248 -SFB 1265],Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft(German Research Foundation (DFG)),This work was supported by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [290045248 -SFB 1265].,,50,4,4,1,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1931-2458,1931-2466,,COMMUN METHODS MEAS,Commun.

Drawing on genre as a social action, we explore the ways in which churnalism is changing news consumption. New news genres are appearing in response to new social interactions that users repeatedly act out predominantly online. As users, we produce and consume texts which we refer to as news in multiple situations which can be sorted into patterns. Our comparative analysis offers surprising insights into how these patterns form new news genres, characteristic of social media (many-to-many) instead of mass media (one-to-many). Genres should be studied not only through textual analysis but also through the prism of social reality and recurrent social actions, particularly now that users, rather than journalists, are taking a dominant role in identifying what constitutes news genres. Our perception of what defines news is determined by the changing ways in which we consume news.","[Rulyova, Natalia] Univ Birmingham, Dept Modern Languages, Birmingham, W Midlands, England; [Westley, Hannah] Amer Univ Paris, Dept Global Commun, Paris, France",,"Westley, H (corresponding author), Amer Univ Paris, Dept Global Commun, Paris, France.",n.e.rulyova@bham.ac.uk; hwestley@aup.edu,,"Rulyova, Natalia/0000-0003-2840-4595",Marie Curie funding; Arts and Humanities Research Council [AH/K000160/1] Funding Source: researchfish; AHRC [AH/K000160/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Marie Curie funding; Arts and Humanities Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Arts & Humanities Research Council (AHRC)); AHRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Arts & Humanities Research Council (AHRC)),Natalia Rulyova was awarded Marie Curie funding to visit the city of Perm in December 2016 on a scholars' exchange programme.,,55,5,5,5,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

These protests were viewed as a lightning rod' for loyalist dissatisfaction with the peace process, as well as a manifestation of their increasing alienation from their unionist political representatives. The covert observation of the Loyalist Peaceful Protest Updater (LPPU) page in January 2013 found some evidence to support the suggestion that social media had become a sectarian battleground' during the flag protests. This created an ethical dilemma in terms of what level of anonymity should be afforded to those who posted such content on the page. While there was no requirement to please' unaware participants, the researcher was wary of inadvertently contributing to the online shaming of loyalists by groups such as Loyalists Against Democracy. Therefore, it was decided to only use direct quotes from public figures, such as the leaders of the flag protest movement, who would presumably have no expectation that their comments would remain private. The narratives of the rank and file' protesters were conveyed through the use of direct quotes that could not be traced back to their authors and the paraphrasing of their comments. In light of the limitations of alternative strategies such as fabrication and word clouds, this was the most appropriate way to illustrate the themes from the LPPU without distorting the voices of these users.","[Reilly, Paul] Univ Leicester, Dept Media & Commun, Leicester, Leics, England; [Trevisan, Filippo] Amer Univ, Sch Commun, Publ Commun Div, Washington, DC 20016 USA",,"Reilly, P (corresponding author), Univ Sheffield, Informat Sch, 211 Portobello, Sheffield S1 4DP, S Yorkshire, England.",p.j.reilly@sheffield.ac.uk; trevisan@american.edu,"Reilly, Paul J/P-3803-2016","Reilly, Paul J/0000-0002-6890-778X",,,,,41,10,11,0,33,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

Though research on the topic has been blooming, we lack a common framework and systematic tool to map and analyze post-truth communication. Therefore, our paper advances the adaptation of claims-making for the analysis of how actors relativize the truth and use discourses of untruthfulness to attack their opponents, constructing their own versions of reality. We extend the affinity between populism and post-truth to conceptualize truth contestation in two aspects: (1) the antagonistic anti-elite constructions of accusations of creating and spreading false information and lies, (2) the emphasis on emotionality and negativity over facts and expertise. Building on a communication-centered approach to populism, we define key content and stylistic characteristics of post-truth claims to study the contestation of truth in political communication in a systematic way. Taking the Twitter communication of Donald Trump as a prime example, we illustrate the employability of our approach via a pilot study on the longest period of shutdown in US history (22 December 2018-25 January 2019). As a result, we introduce claims analysis as an approach that can be usefully adapted to study post-truth discourses.","[Kluknavska, Alena] Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Dept Publ Econ, Lipova 507-41a, Brno 60200, Czech Republic; [Eisele, Olga] Univ Vienna, Dept Commun, Vienna, Austria",,"Kluknavska, A (corresponding author), Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Dept Publ Econ, Lipova 507-41a, Brno 60200, Czech Republic.",alena.kluknavska@econ.muni.cz,"Kluknavská, Alena/N-2632-2019","Kluknavská, Alena/0000-0002-3679-3335",FWF Austrian Science Fund [T-989]; Czech Science Foundation [19-14575Y],FWF Austrian Science Fund(Austrian Science Fund (FWF)); Czech Science Foundation(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic),This work was supported by FWF Austrian Science Fund: [Grant Number T-989]; Czech Science Foundation: [Grant Number 19-14575Y].,,61,0,0,7,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

Drawing on an original sample of 2,509 e-mails sent to Florida Governor Jeb Bush in response to his efforts to reinsert the hydration and nutrition tubes of Terri Schiavo, we analyze how individuals differentially use (in)civility and emotional expression in their claimsmaking. We find that emails sent to Bush about the Schiavo case are largely polite, even when individuals' disagreed with Bush's intervention on Terri's behalf. At the same time, we find a lot of emotional expression in the emails, and that the first emotional expression typically was negative. In order to better understand the relationship between (in)civility and emotion, we qualitatively analyze the 383 emails containing incivility, and find that individuals directed their negative emotional expressions at different targets. Additionally, we see different patterns in how negative emotional expressions are paired with uncivil communication according to the target. Emailers expressing negative emotions and incivility at Bush largely criticize him for violating individual rights, and, nearly half, blast him for prioritizing the Schiavo case over other problems facing the state. In contrast, emailers using uncivil language and negative emotional expressions at Terri's husband and a prominent judge try to persuade Bush to hold one or both of these men accountable for Terri's death. We conclude the paper by underscoring the utility in analytically distinguishing emotional expression from (in)civility.","[Rohlinger, Deana] Florida State Univ, Sociol, 636 West Call St,207 Pepper, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA; [Vaccaro, Christian] Indiana Univ Penn, Sociol, Indiana, PA USA",,"Rohlinger, D (corresponding author), Florida State Univ, Sociol, 636 West Call St,207 Pepper, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA.",drohling@fsu.edu,,,Pepper Institute on Aging and Public Policy,Pepper Institute on Aging and Public Policy,"We would like to thank Miranda Waggoner, Paromita Sanyal, Alex Heckert, Jennifer Earl, Dave Snow, David Meyer and Jill Quadagno for their comments on earlier drafts of this paper.

Applying the concept of articulation, wherein an array of terms are juxtaposed and expressed together, this paper examines how the term data-driven journalism is represented on social media. Focusing on the Twittersphere as the research context, the paper employed the Twitter search application programming interface (API) to harvest all available public tweets (N = 6951) containing hashtags or keywords related to data-driven journalism within a four-week period in late 2016. A text-mining analysis of the contents of these tweets found that they focused extensively on journalistic practices, data visualization, and data analytical techniques. Further analysis on the hashtag co-occurrence network revealed that a number of hashtags bridged and organized the discussion of data-driven journalism in the Twittersphere. Some hashtags on technologies and commercial applications, such as #dataviz, #bigdata, and #datajournalism, were located at important positions in the network. In contrast, public-related terms, such as #opendata or #opengovernment, were mentioned in a limited way and positioned peripherally. Implications for journalism and society are discussed.","[Zhang, Xinzhi] Hong Kong Baptist Univ, Dept Journalism, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",,"Zhang, XZ (corresponding author), Hong Kong Baptist Univ, Dept Journalism, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",xzzhang2@gmail.com,"Zhang, Xinzhi/S-9610-2019","Zhang, Xinzhi/0000-0003-3479-9327",Faculty Research Grant (FRG) of Hong Kong Baptist University [FRG1/16-17/020],Faculty Research Grant (FRG) of Hong Kong Baptist University,A part of this study was funded by a Faculty Research Grant (FRG) of Hong Kong Baptist University [FRG1/16-17/020].,,44,4,4,5,38,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

By examining the intersections between social media and the operations of independent Chinese coffeehouses in the field of taste, this paper puts forward the idea of new taste among Chinese millennials, which comprises individual subjectivity, heterogeneous social relationships, and forms of class distinction. Using taste-oriented keyword searches on WeChat official accounts, 20 articles were returned and analyzed in terms of their textural and visual orientations to examine the processes underlying how taste is influenced in the consumption of specialty coffee in China. Findings suggest the importance of taste makers in this process, from routine creation of aesthetic ambience in the coffeehouses to the construction of affective taste spaces online, and the establishment of taste cycles from online to offline, which all underpin class privilege. Moreover, the emergence of an 'urban cafe community' appears to be characterized by specific forms of belonging resulting from a productive effect of the interplay between independent coffeehouses and consumers in everyday urban life in which a set of aesthetic boundaries reside. Second, these digital consumers distinguish themselves socially by positioning themselves as having a cosmopolitan taste grounded in coffee appreciation instead of merely consuming coffee for physiological benefits. These findings extend taste propositions through engagement of Chinese digital millennial consumers to uncover the underlying cultural classifications.","[Xu, Xinyue] Tsinghua Univ, Sch Journalism & Commun, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Ng, Aaron Yikai] Singapore Inst Technol, Singapore, Singapore",,"Xu, XY (corresponding author), Tsinghua Univ, Sch Journalism & Commun, Beijing, Peoples R China.",xuxy21@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn,,,,,,,36,0,0,0,0,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

For the past decade and a half, this has been the site of extensive ethnographic and ICT-for-development research highlighting complex and nuanced social arrangements, social stratification and local power dynamics. Mobile communication and media appear to either entrench or challenge the status quo, e.g., by strengthening the bond with community members who migrated to urban areas, by disrupting cultural norms or by opening up work and education opportunities. Mobile digital access, use and benefits are unevenly distributed within the community. Teachers and local business people tend to be early adopters and use phones extensively for work-related purposes and to maintain contacts outside the community. The youth appear to be the most sophisticated and frequent users of social media to organise events and meet new people. Somewhat surprisingly, mature women provide some of the most innovative examples of collaboration and empowerment. People of all ages, genders and socio-economic backgrounds recognise the disruptive potential, costs and limitations of digital technology and some deliberately limit themselves to voice calls.

An experimental survey (N = 543) assessed the extent to which individuals ignored PP and TOS when joining a fictitious social networking service (SNS), NameDrop. Results reveal 74% skipped PP, selecting the 'quick join' clickwrap. Average adult reading speed (250-280 words per minute), suggests PP should have taken 29-32 minutes and TOS 15-17 minutes to read. For those that didn't select the clickwrap, average PP reading time was 73 seconds. All participants were presented the TOS and had an average reading time of 51 seconds. Most participants agreed to the policies, 97% to PP and 93% to TOS, with decliners reading PP 30 seconds longer and TOS 90 seconds longer. A regression analysis identifies information overload as a significant negative predictor of reading TOS upon sign up, when TOS changes, and when PP changes. Qualitative findings suggest that participants view policies as nuisance, ignoring them to pursue the ends of digital production, without being inhibited by the means. Implications are revealed as 98% missed NameDrop TOS 'gotcha clauses' about data sharing with the NSA and employers, and about providing a first-born child as payment for SNS access.","[Obar, Jonathan A.] York Univ, Dept Commun Studies, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Oeldorf-Hirsch, Anne] Univ Connecticut, Dept Commun, Storrs, CT USA",,"Obar, JA (corresponding author), York Univ, 4700 Keele St DB 3015, Toronto, ON M3J 1P3, Canada.",jaobar@yorku.ca,"Oeldorf-Hirsch, Anne/G-5343-2015","Oeldorf-Hirsch, Anne/0000-0002-3961-3766",,,,,42,115,116,13,76,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

Less is known, however, about its pivotal role for right-wing social movements which rely on personalized messages to mobilize supporters and challenge the mainstream party system. This paper analyzes online political communication by the right-wing populist movement Pegida and German political parties. We investigate to which extent parties attract supporters of Pegida, to which extent they address topics similar to Pegida and whether their topic use has become more similar over a period of almost two years. The empirical analysis is based on Facebook posts by main accounts and individual representatives of these political groups. We first show that there are considerable overlaps in the audiences of Pegida and the new challenger in the party system, AfD. Then we use topic models to characterize topic use by party and surveyed crowdworkers to which extent they perceive the identified topics as populist communication. The results show that while Pegida and AfD talk about rather unique topics and smaller parties engage to varying degrees with the topics populists emphasize, the two governing parties CDU and SPD clearly deemphasize those. Overall, the findings indicate that the considerable attention devoted to populist actors and shifts in public opinion due to the refugee crisis have left only moderate marks in political communication within the mainstream party system.","[Stier, Sebastian; Posch, Lisa; Bleier, Arnim; Strohmaier, Markus] GESIS Leibniz Inst Social Sci, Dept Computat Social Sci, Cologne, Germany; [Posch, Lisa; Strohmaier, Markus] Univ Koblenz Landau, Dept Comp Sci, Koblenz, Germany",,"Stier, S (corresponding author), GESIS Leibniz Inst Social Sci, Dept Computat Social Sci, Cologne, Germany.",sebastian.stier@gesis.org; lisa.posch@gesis.org; arnim.bleier@gesis.org; markus.strohmaier@gesis.org,"Stier, Sebastian/AAH-4394-2019","Stier, Sebastian/0000-0002-1217-5778",,,,,38,63,63,4,64,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

Women face extreme hostility in the form of digital sexism in discussion rooms, comment sections, gaming communities, and on social media platforms. Reflecting on two years of in-depth interviews with women who have been on the receiving end of gender-based digital abuse (n=38), conversations with industry professionals working in content moderation and digital safety, the extant literature, and news stories about digital attacks against women, I offer a lens to think through the prominent patterns in digital sexism, showing (1) that aggressors draw upon three overlapping strategies - intimidating, shaming, and discrediting - to limit women's impact in digital publics, (2) the way femininity and femaleness are used to undermine women's contributions, and (3) men call attention to women's physicality as a way to pull gender - and the male advantage that comes with it - to the fore in digital exchanges. Finally, I argue that when digital sexism succeeds in pressing women out of digital spaces, constrains the topics they address publicly, or limits the ways they address them, we must consider the democratic costs of gender-based harassment, in addition to the personal ones.","[Sobieraj, Sarah] Tufts Univ, Dept Sociol, Medford, MA 02155 USA",,"Sobieraj, S (corresponding author), Tufts Univ, Dept Sociol, Medford, MA 02155 USA.",sarah.sobieraj@tufts.edu,,"Sobieraj, Sarah/0000-0002-1133-2962",,,,,76,45,45,4,64,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

Memes and transnationality in the far right's digital visual culture,INFORMATION COMMUNICATION & SOCIETY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Memes; visual culture; critical visual analysis; far right; transnationality; collective identity,SOCIAL MEDIA; LANGUAGE; HUMOR,"Current research on visual media and the far right creates two expectations: that memes play an increasingly salient role in the far right's digital visual culture, and that the visual and participatory dimensions of internet culture facilitate greater transnationality. We explore these expectations with a comparative research design, situating memes in relation to other genres of visual content and across different country contexts. Taking a mixed methods approach, this article examines the digital visual culture of 25 far-right alternative media and other non-party organisations in Australia, Italy, Germany, and the United States. We assess the salience of memes and other visual genres, as well as three forms of transnationality: the circulation of images, direct communicative references, and transnational similarities. Unexpectedly, we find that memes play only a limited role in the digital visual culture of far-right non-party organisations, with their uneven concentration in Anglophone alt-media suggesting the potential pitfalls of assumptions about 'global' internet culture. We also find little evidence of transnationality through the circulation of the same visuals across countries, whether memes or other genres. Instead, transnationality works through transnational references within the images themselves and through more parallel practices of reproducing visuals in similar ways with similar themes, but with elements specific to an organisation's national and political context. Within this, we identify three distinct visual discourses - fascist continuity, western civilisational identity, and pop cultural appropriation - which highlight different practices of transnationality and collective identity construction within the far right online.","[McSwiney, Jordan] Univ Sydney, Dept Govt & Int Relat, Camperdown, NSW 2050, Australia; [Vaughan, Michael; Heft, Annett] Free Univ Berlin, Inst Media & Commun Studies, Berlin, Germany; [Vaughan, Michael; Heft, Annett; Hoffmann, Matthias] Weizenbaum Inst Networked Soc, Res Grp Digitalizat & Transnat Publ Sphere, Berlin, Germany; [Hoffmann, Matthias] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Commun, Copenhagen S, Denmark",,"McSwiney, J (corresponding author), Univ Sydney, Dept Govt & Int Relat, Camperdown, NSW 2050, Australia.",jordan.mcswiney@sydney.edu.au; michael.vaughan@fu-berlin.de; annett.heft@fu-berlin.de; matthias.hoffmann@fu-berlin.de,,"McSwiney, Jordan/0000-0003-4317-8012; Hoffmann, Matthias/0000-0001-6480-3679",German Federal Ministry of Education and Research [16DII114],German Federal Ministry of Education and Research(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),This work was supported by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research [grant number 16DII114].,,47,1,1,5,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

It has lowered the access barrier for actors to become publicly visible and reconfigured predominantly vertical flows of information into horizontal communication networks. Media-centric studies hold that these 'hybrid media systems' do not subvert the analogue order tout court, as the media still occupy a central role in selection and distribution processes. In contrast to this, social movement scholars interested in digital forms of mobilization show that civil society actors can directly engage their base and the wider public. Because of this focus, the status and role of the media in these connective efforts has remained largely neglected. This study extends the view of both media-centric and social movement research by asking how the media are included in civil society mobilization efforts online and what status and role they have. Analysing the online communication around the UK climate change debate over a 30-month period, we show that while the media account for a substantial amount of the actors in the networks generated by civil society actors and bloggers, they become more marginal with respect to the authority they command. Not only are they replaced by bloggers as focal points in these digital political communication ecologies, they become next to irrelevant in allocating visibility and attention to other actors. This has ambivalent consequences for democratic discourse, as online debates become more inclusive but also more fragmented, lacking common points of reference.","[Haussler, Thomas] Univ Bern, Inst Commun & Media Studies, Fabrikstr 8, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland",,"Haussler, T (corresponding author), Univ Bern, Inst Commun & Media Studies, Fabrikstr 8, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland.",thomas.haeussler@ikmb.unibe.ch,,"Haussler, Thomas/0000-0001-6949-9135",Swiss National Science Foundation [100017E-135915]; Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Forderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung,Swiss National Science Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)European Commission); Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Forderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung(Austrian Science Fund (FWF)),This work was supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation under grant number 100017E-135915.

We believe this is because they are difficult to interpret: while the models are extremely flexible, they have been criticized as black box techniques due to their difficulty in visualizing the effect of predictors on the outcome of interest. In order to make these models more useful for legislative scholars, we introduce a framework integrating machine learning models with traditional parametric approaches. We then review three interpretative plotting strategies that scholars can use to bring a substantive interpretation to their machine learning models. For each, we explain the plotting strategy, when to use it, and how to interpret it. We then put these plots in action by revisiting two recent articles from Legislative Studies Quarterly.","[Jordan, Soren] Auburn Univ, Auburn, AL 36849 USA; [Paul, Hannah L.] Univ Missouri, Columbia, MO 65211 USA; [Philips, Andrew Q.] Univ Colorado, Boulder, CO 80309 USA",,"Jordan, S (corresponding author), Auburn Univ, Auburn, AL 36849 USA.",,,,,,,,37,0,0,0,0,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0362-9805,1939-9162,,LEGIS STUD QUART,Legis.

This paper contributes to the small body of knowledge on the first point (domestic automation and opinion manipulation) and presents the first piece of research into the second (international automation and opinion manipulation). Findings are based on an analysis of 1.5 million comments on official political information posts on Weibo and 1.1 million posts using hashtags associated with China and Chinese politics on Twitter. In line with previous research, little evidence of automation was found on Weibo. In contrast, a large amount of automation was found on Twitter. However, contrary to expectations and previous news reports, no evidence was found of pro-Chinese-state automation on Twitter. Automation on Twitter was associated with anti-Chinese-state perspectives and published in simplified Mandarin, presumably aimed at diasporic Chinese and mainland users who ?jump the wall? to access blocked platforms. These users come to Twitter seeking more diverse information and an online public sphere but instead they find an information environment in which a small number of anti-Chinese-state voices are attempting to use automation to dominate discourse. Our understanding of public conversation on Twitter in Mandarin is extremely limited and, thus, this paper advances the understanding of political communication on social media.","[Bolsover, Gillian; Howard, Philip] Univ Oxford, Oxford Internet Inst, 1 St Giles, Oxford OX1 3JS, England",,"Bolsover, G (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Oxford Internet Inst, 1 St Giles, Oxford OX1 3JS, England.",gillianbolsover@gmail.com,,,European Research Council [648311],European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC)European Commission),"The authors gratefully acknowledge the support of the European Research Council : 'Computational Propaganda: Investigating the Impact of Algorithms and Bots on Political Discourse in Europe,' Proposal 648311, 2015-2020, Philip N.

Political scientists have offered a variety of conceptual frameworks, but have neglected to explore how ordinary citizens understand terrorism, despite the central role the public plays in our understanding of the relationship between terrorism and government action in the wake of violence. We synthesize components of both scholarly definitions and public debates to formulate predictions for how various attributes of incidents affect the likelihood they are perceived as terrorism. Combining a conjoint experiment with machine learning techniques and automated content analysis of media coverage, we show the importance not only of the type and severity of violence, but also the attributed motivation for the incident and social categorization of the actor. The findings demonstrate how the language used to describe violent incidents, for which the media has considerable latitude, affects the likelihood the public classifies incidents as terrorism.","[Huff, Connor] Harvard Univ, Dept Govt, 1737 Cambridge St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Kertzer, Joshua D.] Harvard Univ, Dept Govt, 1737 Cambridge St,K206, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",,"Huff, C (corresponding author), Harvard Univ, Dept Govt, 1737 Cambridge St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",cdezzanihuff@fas.harvard.edu; jkertzer@gov.harvard.edu,,,Weatherhead Center for International Affairs; Institute for Quantitative Social Science; Niehaus Center for Globalization and Governance,Weatherhead Center for International Affairs; Institute for Quantitative Social Science; Niehaus Center for Globalization and Governance,"We thank Bob Bates, Mia Bloom, Alex Braithwaite, Dara Kay Cohen, Naoki Egami, Marcus Holmes, Jeff Kaplow, In Song Kim, Melia Pfannenstiel, Peter Vining, Ariel White, Thomas Zeitzoff, and audiences at the Political Violence Workshop at Harvard University, ISA 2016, MPSA 2016, Trinity College, Dublin, andWilliam and Mary for helpful comments, suggestions, and assistance.

In this paper, we focus on the U.S. case and present findings from interviews with 17 former social media firm employees (n = 7) and political practitioners (n = 11). We also analyze emails (n = 45) exchanged between Facebook government and elections staffers and two campaigns, a U.S. gubernatorial (2017) and presidential campaign (2016), regarding the platform's policies in the context of paid speech. In addressing questions about Facebook's and Google's processes and policies regarding paid political content, the rationales for them, and the ability of campaigns to contest decisions, this study shows how while Facebook and Google resist being arbiters of political discourse, they actively vet paid content on their platforms. These platforms differ with respect to how and what decisions they make in the context of paid speech and within each company there are active and ongoing debates among staffers about speech. These debates at times take place in consultation with political practitioners and often occur in the context of external events. Across these firms, policies regarding speech evolve through these internal debates, appeals by practitioners, and outside pressure. At the same time, both Facebook and Google make decisions in often opaque ways, according to policies that are not transparent, and without clear justifications to campaigns or the public as to how they are applied or enforced. This limits options for political practitioners to contest regulation decisions. Finally, we conclude by arguing for the need for expanded capacities for political practitioners and the public to exercise voice around the content decisions that these firms make, and for firms to create more robust institutional mechanisms for incorporating it.","[Kreiss, Daniel] Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, Sch Media & Journalism, Chapel Hill, NC USA; [Mcgregor, Shannon C.] Univ Utah, Dept Journalism, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA",,"Kreiss, D (corresponding author), UNC Sch Media & Journalism, Carroll Hall,CB 3365, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA.",dkreiss@email.unc.edu,"McGregor, Shannon C/AAO-1718-2020","McGregor, Shannon/0000-0002-3275-0397",,,,,26,28,28,0,14,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1058-4609,1091-7675,,POLIT COMMUN,Polit.

We argue that even in state-of-the-art media-effects studies that combine measures of media messages and media use (i.e., linkage analyses), measurement error in both the media content analysis and the media use self-reports will typically lead to severely downward-biased effect estimates. We demonstrate this phenomenon using a large Monte Carlo simulation with varying parameters of the content analysis and the survey study. Results show that measurement error in the content analysis and media use variables does indeed lead to smaller effect estimates, especially when the media messages of interest are relatively rare.

They promise more effective and efficient healthcare at a lower cost. Even though evidence suggests that all these promises have yet to be demonstrated in clinical practice, it is undeniable that these technologies are already re-signifying the relationships on the health care landscape, particularly in the physician-patient relationship, which we can already redefine as a 'physician-computer-patient relationship'. This new scenario is undoubtedly promising, but it also poses some fundamental issues that need an urgent answer. An inappropriate use of Machine Learning might involve a dramatic loss in the patients' rights to informed consent or possible discrimination reflecting their personal circumstances. Unfortunately, the traditional principles incorporated by medical law are insufficient to face this challenge. Our most recent regulatory framework, defined by the General Regulation on Data Protection, might be useful in order to avoid this scenario since it includes the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing. In this paper, however, we argue that this legal tool is adequate but not sufficient to address the legal, ethical and social challenges that Machine Learning technologies pose to patients' rights and health care givers' capacities. Therefore, further development of the regulation on this topic and the development of new actors such as the Health Information Counsellors, will be necessary.","[de Miguel, Inigo; Lazcoz, Guillermo] Univ Basque Country, Dept Publ Law, UPV EHU, Chair Law, Leioa, Spain; [de Miguel, Inigo; Lazcoz, Guillermo] Univ Basque Country, Dept Publ Law, UPV EHU, Human Genome Res Grp, Leioa, Spain; [de Miguel, Inigo] Basque Fdn Sci, Ikerbasque, Bilbao, Spain; [Sanz, Begona] Univ Basque Country, Fac Med & Nursery, Dept Physiol, UPV EHU, Bilbao, Spain; [Sanz, Begona] BioCruces Hlth Res Inst, Baracaldo, Spain",,"de Miguel, I (corresponding author), Univ Basque Country, Dept Publ Law, UPV EHU, Chair Law, Leioa, Spain.;de Miguel, I (corresponding author), Univ Basque Country, Dept Publ Law, UPV EHU, Human Genome Res Grp, Leioa, Spain.;de Miguel, I (corresponding author), Basque Fdn Sci, Ikerbasque, Bilbao, Spain.",inigo.demiguelb@ehu.eus,"LAZCOZ, GUILLERMO/AAB-7479-2019; Sanz, Begoña/ABE-7948-2020","LAZCOZ, GUILLERMO/0000-0001-6567-045X; DE MIGUEL BERIAIN, INIGO/0000-0002-2650-5280; Sanz Echevarria, Begona/0000-0002-6354-6401",Eusko Jaurlaritza [Ayudas a grupos de investigacion IT-1066-16]; H2020 Science with and for Society [788039 - PANELFIT],Eusko Jaurlaritza; H2020 Science with and for Society,This work was supported by Eusko Jaurlaritza [grant number Ayudas a grupos de investigacion IT-1066-16]; H2020 Science with and for Society [grant number GRANT AGREEMENT NUMBER-788039 - PANELFIT].,,47,2,2,5,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

There is as yet no standard method for the unsupervised inductive identification of frames based upon the content of articles. Three groups of core approaches underlie a wide range of work in this area, and we compare three techniques based on these approaches against each other and against manual human analysts. The three techniques are a k-means clustering algorithm together with a sophisticated natural language processing (NLP)-based feature selection process; evolutionary factor analysis (EFA), a factor analysis approach; and the structural topic model (STM). We use two datasets - one very focused and one extremely broad - as examples of the kind of frame analysis problems readers may wish to attempt. Even in a highly targeted dataset, we find some distance between the frames generated by computational analysis and those manually produced by our human analysts. The details of each method have a substantial impact on frame quality and interpretation. We find that the STM approach is the most effective for our narrow-scope dataset, but that it returns definite topics, and not frames, when working on our very broad dataset. We also show that we can get results emphasizing different parts of the framing problem by combining parts of different methods as a multi-stage process, rather than viewing available methods as simple plug-and-play models.","[Nicholls, Tom] Univ Oxford, Blavatnik Sch Govt, Oxford OX2 6GG, England; [Culpepper, Pepper D.] Univ Oxford, Blavatnik Sch Govt, Acad Affairs, Oxford, England; [Culpepper, Pepper D.] Univ Oxford, Blavatnik Sch Govt, Govt & Publ Policy, Oxford, England",,"Nicholls, T (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Blavatnik Sch Govt, Oxford OX2 6GG, England.",tom.nicholls@bsg.ox.ac.uk,,"Culpepper, Pepper/0000-0001-6227-0813; Nicholls, Tom/0000-0002-6971-8614",European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union [787887],European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union(European Research Council (ERC)),This project has received funding from the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme (grant agreement No 787887).

Drawing on a content analysis of 399 BuzzFeed news items and 1878 sources during the 2015 and 2017 UK general election campaigns, we established that coverage had shifted, reflecting an editorial agenda that is consistent with how legacy media have long reported politics. In the 2017 election campaign there was more substantive policy reported, new specialist reporters employed, a greater reliance on institutional sources, particularly from established legacy media, and a sharper focus on the two main political parties. Overall, we argue that, as digital native media have evolved, become more popular and interconnected with legacy media, the norms and routines of their news reporting are not necessarily that distinguishable from a singular, institutional news media logic.","[Thomas, Richard] Swansea Univ, Media & Commun, Swansea, W Glam, Wales; [Cushion, Stephen] Cardiff Univ, Sch Journalism Media & Culture, Cardiff, S Glam, Wales",,"Thomas, R (corresponding author), Swansea Univ, Media & Commun, Swansea, W Glam, Wales.",richard.h.thomas@swansea.ac.uk,,,,,,,39,6,6,1,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

However, plugging in these predictions without regard for prediction error renders regression analyses biased, inconsistent, and overconfident.

The search engines' algorithmic content selection strongly influences the diversity of the content received by the users - particularly since most users highly trust search engines and often click on only the first result. A widespread concern is that users are not informed diversely by search engines, but how far this concern applies has hardly been investigated. Our study is the first to investigate content diversity provided by five search engines on ten current political issues in Germany. The findings show that sometimes even the first result is highly diverse, but in most cases, more results must be considered to be informed diversely. This unreliability presents a serious challenge when using search engines as political news sources. Our findings call for media policy measures, for example in terms of algorithmic transparency.","[Steiner, Miriam; Stark, Birgit] Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Dept Commun, Mainz, Germany; [Magin, Melanie; Geiss, Stefan] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Sociol & Polit Sci, Trondheim, Norway",,"Steiner, M (corresponding author), Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Dept Commun, Mainz, Germany.",miriam.steiner@uni-mainz.de,,"Magin, Melanie/0000-0003-2545-3594",research program 'media convergence' (located at the Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz),research program 'media convergence' (located at the Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz),This work was supported by the research program 'media convergence' (located at the Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz).,,59,14,14,4,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

We find that negative ads are more likely to be sponsored by groups than candidates on both television and YouTube. Online ads are less negative and less policy focused.

Such models require costly manual labeling of documents. In this paper, we introduce active learning, a framework in which data to be labeled by human coders are not chosen at random but rather targeted in such a way that the required amount of data to train a machine learning model can be minimized. We study the benefits of active learning using text data examples. We perform simulation studies that illustrate conditions where active learning can reduce the cost of labeling text data. We perform these simulations on three corpora that vary in size, document length, and domain. We find that in cases where the document class of interest is not balanced, researchers can label a fraction of the documents one would need using random sampling (or passive learning) to achieve equally performing classifiers. We further investigate how varying levels of intercoder reliability affect the active learning procedures and find that even with low reliability, active learning performs more efficiently than does random sampling.","[Miller, Blake] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Methodol, Columbia House,Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Linder, Fridolin] NYU, Dept Polit Sci, Social Media & Polit Participat Lab, 431 19 West 4th St, New York, NY 10012 USA; [Mebane, Walter R., Jr.] Univ Michigan, Dept Polit Sci, Haven Hall, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Mebane, Walter R., Jr.] Univ Michigan, Dept Stat, Haven Hall, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",,"Miller, B (corresponding author), London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Methodol, Columbia House,Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",b.a.miller@lse.ac.uk; fridolin.linder@nyu.edu; wmebane@umich.edu,,"Miller, Blake/0000-0002-4707-0984",NSF [SES 1523355],NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)),Work supported by NSF award SES 1523355.,,49,11,11,9,22,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1047-1987,1476-4989,,POLIT ANAL,Polit.

However, much of the research to date on this construct has yet to consider how the eight separate dimensions of charismatic rhetoric may be used in conjunction with one another to form distinctive profiles of charismatic leadership influence. Thus, the present investigation explored the interplay of the individual dimensions using content analysis of the 1960-2012 United States presidential debates. Cluster analysis revealed the emergence of four distinctive rhetorical strategies, one of which was more strongly related to the prediction of influence success as measured by presidential election outcomes. Results suggest that conceptualizing charismatic rhetoric as a multidimensional profile construct represents a valuable area for subsequent research on charismatic rhetoric, and several possible directions are suggested.

Engaged journalists are professional journalists working in alternative media and strongly committed to a political position.

A qualitative content analysis of 21 articles (editorials and op-ed pieces) published in The Intercept Brasil and MadaMasr from 2015 to 2020 (a) develops the concept of engaged journalism in alternative media, (b) reconstructs how two media initiatives in the Global South discursively negotiated editorial actions and distinguished themselves from legacy journalism, and (c) proposes a global transferable understanding of engaged journalism based on research in two media systems. Three themes emerge: raison d'etre and purpose, tensions between democratic and authoritarian norms, and the establishment of legitimacy through an emphasis on journalistic practices, revealing that engaged journalists are driven by media criticism, but still position themselves within journalism, offering a radical new path.

The more information that researchers capture about such content, the more meaningful inferences about effects can be. Therefore, approaches to media effects research in which researchers first analyze the content of interest and then study impact of exposure to instances of such content has much to recommend them. One such approach is to analyze content to which a given population is likely to be exposed and then, in a survey, identify which instances of that content the respondent has (or likely has) seen. Another approach is to identify differences in media content (ideally identified via content analysis) by geographic unit, and use multi-level analyses to look at associated or prospective differences in outcomes. Another approach is via experiment: experimenters can characterize populations of messages via content analysis, and can sample either message exemplars of particular interest to manipulate in fixed effect designs, or create random samples of types of messages to represent message differences using random effect, multi-level analyses. Such approaches can substantially increase strength of inference, support rigorous test of theory, and increase external validity and policy relevance.","[Slater, Michael D.] Ohio State Univ, Sch Commun, 3022 Derby Hall, Columbus, OH 43210 USA",,"Slater, MD (corresponding author), Ohio State Univ, Sch Commun, 3022 Derby Hall, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.",slater.59@osu.edu,"Slater, Michael D/A-6994-2008","Slater, Michael D/0000-0003-4279-346X",,,,,16,11,12,1,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1931-2458,1931-2466,,COMMUN METHODS MEAS,Commun.

Our manually validated automated content analysis (2016-2018; N = 27,830) shows that content varies along with countries' media and authoritarian history: pejoration is more common in countries with a polarized pluralist media system and former authoritarian countries than elsewhere. Newspapers' ideology does not matter, irrespective of countries' level of political parallelism or experiences with authoritarianism.

However, case studies show that news outlets in some countries give more attention to ordinary politicians compared to other democracies. This study examines and explains the variation in media visibility of politicians with different institutional functions across Western democracies. We employ a large-scale content analysis of television news, newspapers and online news in sixteen countries to analyze whether a political system logic determines the distribution of political functions appearing in the news. This logic suggests that journalists follow the political hierarchy of the country when covering politicians. We also check for an additional media logic that would push journalists to focus on a limited number of high-standing politicians. The results confirm that both logics matter, but that mainly the structural characteristics of the political system have an impact on the distribution of news coverage of politicians. In countries where political power is more equally distributed across politicians, a broader range of (elite) politicians makes it into the news. Our results suggest that the media logic is nested in the broader political context and in some cases even strengthens the logic of the political system.","[Vos, Debby] Univ Antwerp, Res Grp Media Movements & Polit M2P, Antwerp, Belgium; [Van Aelst, Peter] Univ Antwerp, Dept Polit Sci, Sint Jacobsstr 2, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium",,"Van Aelst, P (corresponding author), Univ Antwerp, Dept Polit Sci, Sint Jacobsstr 2, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium.",peter.vanaelst@uantwerpen.be,"Van Aelst, Peter/E-2285-2019","Van Aelst, Peter/0000-0002-2548-0309",,,,,60,7,7,6,34,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1058-4609,1091-7675,,POLIT COMMUN,Polit.

By personalized storytelling, I mean a political message in the form of a narrative that includes a specific reference to an individual affected by an issue. Using a content analysis of party convention speeches, this article shows that presidential candidates tell an increasing amount of stories, particularly from 1980 onward. Through randomized Internet experiments and a general population sample, I demonstrate that personalized stories have a unique influence on the public by parsing out the independent causal effect of the storyteller's partisanship, the personalization of the story, and the content of the story. Not only can stories change attitudes about issues, but personalized stories can also change how individuals evaluate the candidate telling the story. However, an impersonal story that only references a generic group, rather than a singular individual, does not improve the partisan storyteller's favorability. Results suggest that modern presidential candidates might be motivated to tell more stories because personalizing an issue may improve their standing with the public.","[Gooch, Andrew] Yale Univ, Inst Social & Policy Studies, 77 Prospect St, New Haven, CT 06511 USA; [Gooch, Andrew] Yale Univ, Ctr Study Amer Polit, 77 Prospect St, New Haven, CT 06511 USA",,"Gooch, A (corresponding author), Yale Univ, Inst Social & Policy Studies, 77 Prospect St, New Haven, CT 06511 USA.;Gooch, A (corresponding author), Yale Univ, Ctr Study Amer Polit, 77 Prospect St, New Haven, CT 06511 USA.",andrew.gooch@yale.edu,,,,,,,50,5,5,0,9,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1058-4609,1091-7675,,POLIT COMMUN,Polit.

But many studies do not take into account audience expectations of fact-checking or their engagement with news generally in the context of a national media system or its political culture. Our study makes an intervention into debates about fact-checking by focussing on the effectiveness this type of journalism has with audiences who were attentive to the news in the UK's media system during a key point in a major health crisis. Drawing on a six-week news diary study (N = 200) during the coronavirus pandemic, our study concluded that the UK's impartial media ecology and public service ethos creates an environment where audiences are largely receptive to journalists' fact-checking and countering misinformation. Yet our content analysis of television news (N = 1259) during the pandemic found most broadcasters did not regularly challenge or question the government's decision-making. We argue that since audiences favoured robust forms of journalistic scrutiny, broadcasters could more prominently fact-check claims and question dubious statements without undermining trust in journalism. We recommend scholars should pay more attention to understanding the audience reception of fact-checking across different media and political systems.","[Cushion, Stephen; Morani, Marina; Kyriakidou, Maria; Soo, Nikki] Two Cent Sq,Cent Sq, Cardiff, Wales",,"Cushion, S (corresponding author), Two Cent Sq,Cent Sq, Cardiff, Wales.",Cushionsa@Cardiff.ac.uk,,"Morani, Marina/0000-0002-7599-843X",Arts and Humanities Research Council [AH/S012508/1],Arts and Humanities Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Arts & Humanities Research Council (AHRC)),This work was supported by Arts and Humanities Research Council [Grant Number AH/S012508/1].,,32,1,1,9,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

Previous research often examined either the diversity of news content or the audience's choices. This study of online news use in Austria does both to assess audience selectivity systematically. It first investigates the topics and bias of news sites based on a content analysis (N = 2069), before survey data (N = 2829) are used to investigate how far online news users select outlets that match their preferences. Content differences exist to some extent, but people hardly match them with their personal preferences. We conclude that, across the population, there is a substantive interest in general-interest digital journalism. In contrast to what selective exposure research suggests, factors other than interests and orientation might guide the choice for a specific news site.","[Trilling, Damian] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Sch Commun Res, Dept Commun Sci, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Schoenbach, Klaus] Univ Vienna, Dept Commun, Vienna, Austria",,"Trilling, D (corresponding author), Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Sch Commun Res, Dept Commun Sci, Amsterdam, Netherlands.",d.c.trilling@uva.nl; klaus.schoenbach@northwestern.edu,,"Trilling, Damian/0000-0002-2586-0352",,,,,47,12,12,1,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

Our findings are based on two separate studies: (1) a survey experiment and (2) a cross-sectional analysis that increases external validity by combining survey data with computational content analysis of the articles respondents were exposed to by their primary news sources throughout the 2016 US presidential campaign (415,604 articles from 157 American news outlets).

Advancing the field, we investigate differences in politicians' use of populist communication in pre- and post-election periods by analyzing a comprehensive sample of Facebook posts and tweets (N=1,010) of the leading candidates in the 2017 national parliamentary elections in Austria and the Netherlands. We identify important stylistic elements that resonate with populist political communication such as negative emotions or an us-versus-them rhetoric. Our findings further suggest that although populist communication is more prevalent in the SNS communication of right-wing and left-wing populist parties, political actors across all parties are more likely to use populist communication before than after elections. In line with recent conceptualizations, we argue that populism can be understood as a framework of communication with measurable sub frames, which can be expressed by different political actors with different goals. Understanding populism as a discursive framework of communication can ultimately help to reconcile existing divergent conceptualizations of populism.","[Schmuck, Desiree] Univ Vienna, Advertising & Media Effects Res Grp, Wahringer Str 29, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; [Hameleers, Michael] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Sch Commun Res, Amsterdam, Netherlands",,"Schmuck, D (corresponding author), Univ Vienna, Advertising & Media Effects Res Grp, Wahringer Str 29, A-1090 Vienna, Austria.",desiree.schmuck@univie.ac.at,"Schmuck, Desiree/AAA-5465-2021","Schmuck, Desiree/0000-0002-9492-6052",,,,,48,25,25,5,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

Using real-world data, we illustrate how our mechanism could be applied to the assignment of refugee families to host country locations, and kindergarteners to schools. Our mechanism allows a planner to first specify a threshold g for the minimum acceptable average outcome score that should be achieved by the assignment. In the refugee matching context, this score corresponds to the probability of employment, whereas in the student assignment context, it corresponds to standardized test scores. The mechanism is a priority mechanism that considers both outcomes and preferences by assigning agents (refugee families and students) based on their preferences, but subject to meeting the planner's specified threshold. The mechanism is both strategy-proof and constrained efficient in that it always generates a matching that is not Pareto dominated by any other matching that respects the planner's threshold.","[Acharya, Avidit; Hainmueller, Jens] Stanford Univ, Dept Polit Sci, 616 Serra St Encina Hall West,Room 100, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Bansak, Kirk] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Polit Sci, 9500 Gilman Dr, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA",,"Acharya, A (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Dept Polit Sci, 616 Serra St Encina Hall West,Room 100, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",avidit@stanford.edu; kbansak@ucsd.edu; jhain@stanford.edu,,"Hainmueller, Jens/0000-0001-8214-9041",Rockefeller Foundation; Schmidt Futures; Stanford AI Lab; Stanford Graduate School of Business; Stanford School of Medicine,Rockefeller Foundation; Schmidt Futures; Stanford AI Lab; Stanford Graduate School of Business; Stanford School of Medicine,"We acknowledge funding from the Rockefeller Foundation, Schmidt Futures, and the 2018 HAI seed grant program from the Stanford AI Lab, Stanford School of Medicine, and Stanford Graduate School of Business.

This paper builds on previous studies of social construction of knowledge online and investigates how contributors in online communities collaboratively share and construct controversial scientific knowledge. As the general public participates in such knowledge collaboration, understanding the processes through which they contribute content and roles that they play is imperative. The authors conducted the content analysis of three online communities that engage in knowledge collaboration on the subject of Measles, Mumps, and Rubella (MMR) vaccination, which is perceived as contentious knowledge by the public due to the widespread myth among parents that the MMR vaccine is associated with autism. The study's findings include that the content discussed is influenced by the purposes of the communities, nature of the tasks, and demographics of participants, although they discussed the same topic. The authors also found that the framework of knowledge reuse and knowledge co-construction sites is useful for investigating the content and roles that appeared in the three communities. The contribution of the paper includes the analytical framework of knowledge reuse and knowledge co-construction, articulation of the content and roles that appeared in online communities, and unboxing of discourses in three different online communities.

It hypothesizes that salient issues (immigration and corruption) and campaign-related posts will obtain more user reaction, while policy topics and mobilization-related content will be less engaging. The effects of issue ownership on user engagement are also tested. For this, the study draws upon an extensive dataset that includes all Facebook posts of each candidate (511 candidates 38030 posts) running for MP positions, posted between the official starting day of the campaign and Election Day. Topics are identified by dictionary-based and supervised learning methods that allow us to categorize a larger set of data than earlier works. The results show that corruption, development policy, and campaign are the most popular topics with users.

The ongoing contraction of legacy media has led to concerns for the public sphere. Some theorists have placed hope in citizen journalism, including a kind of citizen journalism that takes place on social news sharing sites, as potentially filling some gaps left by shrinking public affairs journalism. However, little research has been conducted to investigate what citizens use as sources of information in discussion on social news sites.

How the Timing of Politicians' Information Subsidies Affects What Becomes News,POLITICAL COMMUNICATION,,,English,Article,,,,,,timing; media attention; politicians; information subsidies; content analysis,MEDIA; AGENDA; CONSTRUCTION; LEGISLATORS; WAVES,"From all information subsidies that politicians send out on a given day, only a few make it into the news media. The literature on news selection tries to understand which factors enhance the chance that a message gets covered. This paper contributes to that literature by studying one specific factor: the timing of the dissemination of the message. Between July 2017 and July 2018 we gathered all press releases, press conferences, and tweets of more than 200 Belgian politicians. During the same period, we collected all articles of 15 print and online news media. Via a combination of automated and manual content analysis, we measured to what extent politicians' information subsidies were covered in the news and investigate whether success can be explained by their timing. The results show that timing matters, and that different information subsidies face different timing opportunities. Press releases and press conferences are most successful when they are disseminated at times when the journalistic demand for new information is high (e.g., in the absence of big events or during political recess). This sometimes works for Twitter as well, but tweets receive especially more coverage when they are published at times when journalists need additional viewpoints about existing stories (e.g., when they deal with an ongoing big event or when they are sent out in the middle of the day). All in all, this paper puts timing on the map as a non-negligible factor of the news selection process.","[Ketelaars, Pauline; Sevenans, Julie] Univ Antwerp, Dept Polit Sci, Sint Jacobstr 2, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium",,"Sevenans, J (corresponding author), Univ Antwerp, Dept Polit Sci, Sint Jacobstr 2, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium.",julie.sevenans@uantwerpen.be,,,"Fonds Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek [12P5717N,12X6218N, G012517N]",Fonds Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek(FWO),"This work was supported by the Fonds Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek [12P5717N,12X6218N, G012517N].",,51,0,0,2,9,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1058-4609,1091-7675,,POLIT COMMUN,Polit.

We explain how this technique works, how different choices by the researcher affect the results and how the results can be meaningfully interpreted. To demonstrate its usefulness for journalism research, we conducted a case study of the New York Times coverage of nuclear technology from 1945 to the present, partially replicating a study by Gamson and Modigliani.

Textual analysis has proved useful for these purposes, and automated methods can further improve research in this direction. Here, we propose a method to derive a score of parties' levels of populism using supervised machine learning to perform textual analysis on national manifestos. We illustrate the advantages of our approach, which allows for measuring populism for a vast number of parties and countries without resource-intensive human-coding processes and provides accurate, updated information for temporal and spatial comparisons of populism. Furthermore, our method allows for obtaining a continuous score of populism, which ensures more fine-grained analyses of the party landscape while reducing the risk of arbitrary classifications. To illustrate the potential contribution of this score, we use it as a proxy for parties' levels of populism, analyzing average trends in six European countries from the early 2000s for nearly two decades.","[Di Cocco, Jessica] Sapienza Univ, Dept Econ, Via Castro Laurenziano 19, I-00161 Rome, Italy; [Monechi, Bernardo] Sony Comp Sci Labs, 6 Rue Amyot, F-75005 Paris, France",,"Di Cocco, J (corresponding author), Sapienza Univ, Dept Econ, Via Castro Laurenziano 19, I-00161 Rome, Italy.",jessica.dicocco@uniroma1.it,,"Di Cocco, Jessica/0000-0001-8355-6730",,,,,70,0,0,2,2,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1047-1987,1476-4989,,POLIT ANAL,Polit.

At the same time short-term factorssuch as the media's coverage of issues, parties, and candidates during an election campaignhave become more important for voters' decisions. While previous research did look at how campaign news in general affects electoral volatility in general, it has omitted to explicitly test the mechanisms underlying these effects. Building on theories of agenda setting, (affective) priming, and issue ownership, the current study aims to explain why certain news aspects lead voters to switch their vote choice. We theorize it is the visibility of a party, the evaluation of a party, and the attention for issues owned by a party that primes voters to switch to a certain party. We use national panel survey data (N=765) and link this to an extensive content analysis of campaign news on television and in newspapers in the run up to the 2012 Dutch national elections. The results show that issue news leads to vote change in the direction of the party that owns the issue. Even stronger is the effect of party visibility on vote switching. Our results, however, find the strongest support for the effect of party evaluations on vote change: More favorable news about a party increases switching to that party.","[Geers, Sabine; Bos, Linda] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Sch Commun Res ASCoR, Dept Commun, Amsterdam, Netherlands",,"Geers, S (corresponding author), Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Sch Commun Res ASCoR, Postbus 15793, NL-1001 NG Amsterdam, Netherlands.",S.Geers@uva.nl,"Bos, Linda/ABG-5887-2020","Bos, Linda/0000-0002-0160-3490",,,,,68,15,17,1,19,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1058-4609,1091-7675,,POLIT COMMUN,Polit.

Yet one important question that persists within the fields of political science, communication, and psychology is whether appearance or substance matters more during political campaigns. To a large extent, this appearance vs. substance question remains open and, crucially, the notion that appearance can in fact effectively sway voter perceptions is consequential for the health of democracy. This study leverages advances from the fields of machine learning and computer vision to expand our knowledge on how nonverbal elements of political communication influence voters immediate impressions of political actors. We rely on video from the 4th Republican Party presidential debate held on November 10, 2016, as well as continuous response approval data from a live focus group (n = 311; 36,528 reactions), to determine how the emotional displays of political candidates influence voter impression formation. Our results suggest that anger displays can positively influence viewers' real-time evaluations. Happiness displays, on the other hand, are much less effective in eliciting a response from the viewing public, while fear displays were rarely projected by the candidates of the debate under study.","[Boussalis, Constantine; Coan, Travis G.] Trinity Coll Dublin, Dept Polit Sci, Dublin, Ireland; [Boussalis, Constantine; Coan, Travis G.] Univ Exeter, Polit Dept, Exeter, Devon, England; [Boussalis, Constantine; Coan, Travis G.] Exeter Q Step Ctr, Exeter, Devon, England; [Boussalis, Constantine; Coan, Travis G.] Trinity Coll Dublin, Dept Polit Sci, 3 Coll Green, Dublin 2, Ireland",,"Boussalis, C (corresponding author), Trinity Coll Dublin, Dept Polit Sci, 3 Coll Green, Dublin 2, Ireland.",boussalc@tcd.ie,"Boussalis, Constantine/AAC-5373-2022",,Trinity College Dublin [Arts and Social Sciences Benefactions Fund] [2018-19]; UK Economic and Social Research Council [ES/N012283/1],Trinity College Dublin [Arts and Social Sciences Benefactions Fund]; UK Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),This work was supported by the Trinity College Dublin [Arts and Social Sciences Benefactions Fund 2018-19].

Against this backdrop, we rely on an extensive content analysis of fact-checked statements in the US (N = 894) to assess to what extent and how different forms of incivility are present in different degrees of false information. Our main findings illustrate that partisan attacks, negativity, and hate speech are most likely to occur in false information that deviates furthest from reality. These findings help us to dissect different degrees of untruthfulness based on their content features: Disinformation (goal-directed deception) may be distinguished from misinformation (unintentionally misleading content) based on the centrality of hostility, partisan attacks, and hate speech in the former.","[Hameleers, Michael; Vliegenthart, Rens] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Sch Commun Res, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [van der Meer, Toni] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Sch Commun Res, Dept Corp Commun, Amsterdam, Netherlands",,"Hameleers, M (corresponding author), Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Sch Commun Res, Amsterdam, Netherlands.;Hameleers, M (corresponding author), Nieuwe Achtergracht 166, NL-1018 WV Amsterdam, Netherlands.",m.hameleers@uva.nl; G.L.A.vandermeer@uva.nl; r.vliegenthart@uva.nl,,,Facebook's Content Policy Research Initiative,Facebook's Content Policy Research Initiative,This project was supported by a gift from Facebook's Content Policy Research Initiative.,,30,4,4,3,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

We propose four ideal campaign types based on their ideal-typical target audience: partisan-, mass-, target group- and individual-centered campaigns. In reality, each campaign combines elements of all types. To examine this mixture empirically, we apply a most similar systems design and investigate five German and six Austrian parties' use of Facebook in the 2013 national election campaigns. On the basis of face-to-face interviews with the campaign managers and a quantitative content analysis of the respective parties' Facebook pages, we analyze how parties used Facebook as a campaigning tool to inform, interact with, and mobilize voters, as well as which target audiences they addressed. We find that, although the campaign managers declare Facebook their most important Web 2.0 campaigning tool, the German and Austrian parties did not make use of Facebook's interactive and mobilizing potential, rather relying on mass-centered information, possibly due to the framework conditions in both countries. Based on our findings, we conclude that the role of context for election campaigning should be discussed more carefully.","[Magin, Melanie; Hassler, Joerg] Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Dept Commun, Jakob Welder Weg 12, D-55099 Mainz, Germany; [Podschuweit, Nicole] Univ Erfurt, Dept Commun, German Res Fdn Project, Role Interpersonal Polit Commun Proc Media Effect, Erfurt, Germany; [Russmann, Uta] Univ Appl Sci Management & Commun, FHWien WKW, Dept Commun Mkt & Sales, Vienna, Austria",,"Magin, M (corresponding author), Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Dept Commun, Jakob Welder Weg 12, D-55099 Mainz, Germany.",magin@uni-mainz.de; nicole.podschuweit@uni-erfurt.de; joerg.hassler@uni-mainz.de; uta.russmann@fh-wien.ac.at,,"Hassler, Jorg/0000-0003-2907-5228; Magin, Melanie/0000-0003-2545-3594; Russmann, Uta/0000-0002-8684-6976",,,,,54,52,53,6,49,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

This paper, based on (1) a comprehensive content analysis of newspaper coverage, and (2) interviews with journalists covering stories related to surveillance in the United Kingdom, outlines a key tension between journalists' self-understandings and practices which has profound consequences. On the one hand, we suggest, media coverage contributes to normalizing surveillance by emphasizing concerns about national security and stressing the surveillance of elites, to the detriment of an interest in the gathering of bulk data on populations. On the other hand, journalists, though acknowledging national security concerns, are frequently critical of and resistant to the extent, nature and necessity of mass surveillance. Our paper suggests that despite journalists' desire to communicate the complexities of mass surveillance, the structural constraints of their professional practice-in particular their reliance on official sources-make it difficult for reporting to move beyond the legitimating discourses provided by these official sources.","[Wahl-Jorgensen, Karin; Cable, Jonathan] Cardiff Univ, Cardiff Sch Journalism Media & Cultural Studies, Cardiff, S Glam, Wales; [Bennett, Lucy K.] Cardiff Univ, Cardiff, S Glam, Wales",,"Wahl-Jorgensen, K (corresponding author), Cardiff Univ, Cardiff Sch Journalism Media & Cultural Studies, Cardiff, S Glam, Wales.",Wahl-jorgensenk@cardiff.ac.uk; Bennettlucyk@gmail.com; CableJ1@cardiff.ac.uk,,"Wahl-Jorgensen, Karin/0000-0002-8461-5795; Bennett, Lucy/0000-0003-2264-7596; Cable, Jonathan/0000-0002-2585-3419",United Kingdom's Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC),United Kingdom's Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"This paper is based on research carried out as part of the Digital Citizenship and Surveillance Society project, funded by the United Kingdom's Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC).",,51,10,10,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

At the same time, aggregating them into broad topics or issues often is too coarse and loses nuance. Both theoretically and methodologically, the analysis of an appropriate intermediate level of aggregation is underdeveloped. This article advances research in various areas of journalism studies by developing a theoretical argument for introducing the news event as a level of analysis. Based on this, we discuss several computational approaches to empirically detect such news events in large corpora of news coverage in an unsupervised manner. We provide two approaches: One based on traditional tf center dot idf based cosine similarities, and one that relies on word embeddings, in particular the softcosine measure. Both methods, combined with a network clustering algorithm, perform very well in detecting news events. We apply this method in a case study of 45k news articles from different outlets, in which we show that different news outlets have distinct profiles in the events they cover.","[Trilling, Damian; van Hoof, Marieke] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Sch Commun Res, Dept Commun Sci, Amsterdam, Netherlands",,"Trilling, D (corresponding author), Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Sch Commun Res, Dept Commun Sci, Amsterdam, Netherlands.",d.c.trilling@uva.nl,,"Trilling, Damian/0000-0002-2586-0352; van Hoof, Marieke/0000-0002-4117-837X",SURF Cooperative,SURF Cooperative,This work was carried out on the Dutch national e-infrastructure with the support of SURF Cooperative.,,59,2,2,4,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

The study conducted in-depth interviews with data experts and Syrian refugees in Estonia and Turkey. The results indicate that both refugees and data experts acknowledge the algorithms' potential power for structuring the everyday life experiences of people. Whereas refugees mainly focused on cultural and social concerns, the data experts underlined the importance of refugees' agency and the potential drawbacks of algorithms in terms of transparency and accountability. While both groups of interviewees thought the relocation algorithm could be useful especially in economic terms, the study demonstrates that algorithms create complex power relations and place extra pressure on both refugees and data experts. The new digital landscapes produced by algorithms entail a 'triple agency' - an agency of experts developing and using these datafied solutions, an agency of data subjects being targets of those calculations, and an agency of algorithms. For solving the issue of 'false authority', where the modelling of spatial choice cannot grasp the socio-cultural reality, it is necessary to consider the socio-cultural context of the calculative devices. A paradigm shift in machine learning is necessary from learning machines as autonomous subjects to machines learning from social contexts and individuals' experiences. Rather than experimenting with algorithmic solutions to speed up decisions about human lives, migration policies and relevant datafied solutions should consider the diversity of human experiences expressed in individuals' everyday life.","[Masso, Anu] Tallinn Univ Technol, Ragnar Nurkse Dept Innovat & Governance, Tallinn, Estonia; [Kasapoglu, Tayfun] Univ Tartu, Inst Social Studies, Tartu, Estonia",,"Masso, A (corresponding author), Tallinn Univ Technol, Ragnar Nurkse Dept Innovat & Governance, Tallinn, Estonia.;Kasapoglu, T (corresponding author), Univ Tartu, Inst Social Studies, Tartu, Estonia.",anu.masso@taltech.ee; tayfun.kasapoglu@ut.ee,"Kasapoglu, Tayfun/AAU-9305-2021","Kasapoglu, Tayfun/0000-0002-1721-7164; Masso, Anu/0000-0002-3134-950X",Estonian Research Council [IUT20-38]; European Regional Development Fund (Dora Plus); Development Program ASTRA of Tallinn University of Technology [TalTech 2014-2020.4.01.16-0032],Estonian Research Council(Estonian Research Council); European Regional Development Fund (Dora Plus); Development Program ASTRA of Tallinn University of Technology,This work was supported by the Estonian Research Council (IUT20-38); European Regional Development Fund (Dora Plus); Development Program ASTRA of Tallinn University of Technology (TalTech 2014-2020.4.01.16-0032).,,50,5,5,1,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

In this respect news should act as: a source of accurate and plural information for citizens; a watchdog on elites; a mediator and/or representative of communities; and as an advocate of the public in campaigning terms. All of these roles are under pressure in the United Kingdom's commercial local news sector. This has led many to speculate, often without evidence, that the output of a new generation of (mainly online) hyperlocal citizen news producers might (at least partially) play some of these roles. To test this assumption, we completed 34 semi-structured interviews with producers, the largest content analysis to date of UK hyperlocal news content (1941 posts on 313 sites), and the largest ever survey of UK community news practitioners (183 responses). We found that these sites produce a good deal of news about community activities, local politics, civic life and local business. Official news sources get a strong platform, but the public (local citizens, community groups) get more of a say than in much mainstream local news. Although there was little balanced coverage in the traditional sense, many community journalists have developed alternative strategies to foster and inform plural debate around contentious local issues. The majority of hyperlocal news producers cover community campaigns and a significant minority have initiated their own. We also found that critical public-interest investigations are carried out by a (surprisingly) large number of community news producers.","[Williams, Andy] Cardiff Univ, Sch Journalism Media & Cultural Studies, Cardiff, Wales; [Harte, Dave; Turner, Jerome] Birmingham City Univ, Birmingham Sch Media, Birmingham, W Midlands, England",,"Williams, A (corresponding author), Cardiff Univ, Sch Journalism Media & Cultural Studies, Cardiff, Wales.",Williamsa28@cf.ac.uk; Dave.harte@bcu.ac.uk; Jerome.turner@bcu.ac.uk,"Harte, David/J-4888-2019","Harte, David/0000-0002-2506-1438",Arts and Humanities Research Council [AH/J005290/1]; AHRC [AH/J005290/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Arts and Humanities Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Arts & Humanities Research Council (AHRC)); AHRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Arts & Humanities Research Council (AHRC)),This work was supported by the Arts and Humanities Research Council under its Connected Communities scheme [grant number AH/J005290/1].,,47,52,55,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

In multidimensional scaling models, we inspect how the media outlets relate to each other. The results show two types of RAM that deviate from the mainstream in different ways. The first type is clearly distinguishable by its interpretive style and heavy use of alternative frames. Media of this type openly oppose immigration, the German government and mainstream media. The second type, consisting of international news providers like RT, exhibits a more descriptive style and frame repertories that are similar to conservative mainstream media.

In three regions, unopposed media messages with a populist stance have a conditional effect on populist attitudes that depends on prior convictions. A higher dose of exposure to populist news coverage enhances both prior agreement and disagreement with populism.

Using a content analysis of 46,218 cable and broadcast television news transcripts from the 109th through 112th Congresses, we examined the frequency with which members of Congress appeared on cable and broadcast news. When we modelled on-air statements by members of Congress as a function of legislator and institutional characteristics, we revealed a gatekeeping function that vastly overrepresents extreme partisans on both sides of the aisle. The effect is largely consistent for network and cable outlets alike, suggesting that gatekeeping processes under both market and advocacy models bias content towards the extreme and conflictual. This finding is particularly important in light of recent evidence linking media-driven misperceptions about polarization to partisan-ideological sorting and negative political affect in the electorate.","[Padgett, Jeremy] Univ Mobile, Dept Commun, Mobile, AL 36613 USA; [Dunaway, Johanna L.] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Commun, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Darr, Joshua P.] Louisiana State Univ, Manship Sch Mass Commun, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA",,"Darr, JP (corresponding author), Louisiana State Univ, Manship Sch Mass Commun, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA.",jdarr@lsu.edu,"Darr, Joshua/AAV-9533-2020","Darr, Joshua/0000-0002-0388-5559",,,,,70,3,3,1,17,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0021-9916,1460-2466,,J COMMUN,J.

We propose the use of the within-country variation of these topics to predict the timing of conflict. This allows us to avoid the tendency of predicting conflict only in countries where it occurred before. We show that the within-country variation of topics is a good predictor of conflict and becomes particularly useful when risk in previously peaceful countries arises. Two aspects seem to be responsible for these features. Topics provide depth because they consist of changing, long lists of terms that make them able to capture the changing context of conflict.

We explore three dimensions of press-party parallelism in order to study its dynamics: visibility of political parties, the effective number of parties represented in newspapers, and lastly, favorability toward political parties. First, within each campaign cycle, as election day approaches, visibility of the incumbent party increases while the visibility of other parties tends to decline. Likewise, the incumbent party's visibility increases across the four elections we study. Second, for all newspaper groups, the number of parties that receive favorable or unfavorable coverage declines over consecutive election terms. Third, the incumbent party is the only that gains in terms of positive coverage within and across each election campaign period.

But political scientists are often interested in how effects vary across subpopulations-heterogeneous treatment effects-and how differences in the content of the treatment affects responses-the response to heterogeneous treatments. Several new methods have been introduced to estimate heterogeneous effects, but it is difficult to know if a method will perform well for a particular data set. Rather than using only one method, we show how an ensemble of methods-weighted averages of estimates from individual models increasingly used in machine learning-accurately measure heterogeneous effects. Building on a large literature on ensemble methods, we show how the weighting of methods can contribute to accurate estimation of heterogeneous treatment effects and demonstrate how pooling models lead to superior performance to individual methods across diverse problems. We apply the ensemble method to two experiments, illuminating how the ensemble method for heterogeneous treatment effects facilitates exploratory analysis of treatment effects.","[Grimmer, Justin] Univ Chicago, Dept Polit Sci, 5828 S Univ Ave, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Messing, Solomon] Data Labs, Pew Res Ctr, 1615 L St NW, Washington, DC USA; [Westwood, Sean J.] Dartmouth Coll, Dept Govt, Hanover, NH 03755 USA",,"Grimmer, J (corresponding author), Univ Chicago, Dept Polit Sci, 5828 S Univ Ave, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",jgrimmer@stanford.edu,,,,,,,40,37,37,3,18,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1047-1987,1476-4989,,POLIT ANAL,Polit.

The consequences of this practice, which occurs in over two-thirds of recent computational work in political science, are underappreciated. Imperfect proxies can reflect noise and contamination from other concepts, producing biased point estimates and standard errors. We demonstrate how analysts can use causal diagrams to articulate theoretical concepts and their relationships to estimated proxies, then apply straightforward rules to assess which conclusions are rigorously supportable. We formalize and extend common heuristics for signing the bias-a technique for reasoning about unobserved confounding-to scenarios with imperfect proxies. Using these tools, we demonstrate how, in often-encountered research settings, proxy-based analyses allow for valid tests for the existence and direction of theorized effects. We conclude with best-practice recommendations for the rapidly growing literature using learned proxies to test causal theories.","[Knox, Dean] Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Operat Informat & Decis Dept & Analyt Wharton, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Lucas, Christopher] Washington Univ, Dept Polit Sci, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; [Lucas, Christopher] Washington Univ, Div Computat & Data Sci, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; [Cho, Wendy K.

This article, however, stresses that there is more to the representative process in European democracies than just its textbook version. It emphasizes the role of geographic representation as a complementary strategy in party-dominated legislatures that is characterized by two distinct features. First, legislators employ distinct opportunities to participate in legislative contexts to signal attention to geographic constituents without disrupting party unity. Second, these activities are motivated by individual- and district-level characteristics that supplement electoral-system-level sources of geographic representation. We empirically test and corroborate this argument for the German case on the basis of a content analysis of parliamentary questions in the 17th German Bundestag (2009-13). In this analysis, we show that higher levels of localness among legislators and higher levels of electoral volatility in districts result in increased geographic representation.","[Zittel, Thomas] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Dept Social Sci, Theodor W Adorno Pl 1,Postfach 40, D-60629 Frankfurt, Germany; [Nyhuis, Dominic] Leibniz Univ Hannover, Dept Polit Sci, Schneiderberg 50, D-30167 Hannover, Germany; [Baumann, Markus] Heidelberg Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Bergheimer Str 58, D-69115 Heidelberg, Germany",,"Zittel, T (corresponding author), Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Dept Social Sci, Theodor W Adorno Pl 1,Postfach 40, D-60629 Frankfurt, Germany.",zittel@soz.uni-frankfurt.de; d.nyhuis@ipw.uni-hannover.de; markus.baumann@ipw.uni-heidelberg.de,"Zittel, Thomas/AAH-6466-2021","Zittel, Thomas/0000-0003-2964-6617",,,,,81,24,24,1,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0362-9805,1939-9162,,LEGIS STUD QUART,Legis.

We find that the performance of the crowd recommends crowdcoded data as a reliable and valid alternative to manually coded data, also for less manifest contents. While scale manipulations affected the results, minor modifications of the coding instructions or material presentation did not significantly influence data quality.

Moreover, our research aims to understand the extent to which the calls to action were used in the campaign during a time of strong political polarization in the country. The methodology consists of a content analysis aimed at understanding the message content of the consultations, how that content was shared, and similarities between this call to action and the electoral campaign strategies. The results show that this call to action caused a participatory distortion on that particular Portal, the topics covered were part of the elected candidate's campaign platform, and the strategy was maintained after elections.","[Chagas, Viktor] Fluminense Fed Univ, Niteroi, RJ, Brazil; [Mitozo, Isabele] Univ Fed Maranhao, Sao Luis, Maranhao, Brazil; [Barros, Samuel] Fed Univ Reconcavo Bahia UFRB, Cruz Das Almas, Brazil; [Santos, Joao Guilherme] Brazilian Natl Inst Sci & Technol Digital Democra, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Azevedo, Dilvan] Fed Univ Bahia UFBA, Commun & Contemporary Culture, Cruz Das Almas, Brazil",,"Chagas, V (corresponding author), Fluminense Fed Univ, Niteroi, RJ, Brazil.",viktor@midia.uff.br,"Chagas, Viktor/U-1175-2018; Rocha Barros, Samuel Anderson/U-4952-2018","Chagas, Viktor/0000-0002-1806-6062; Passos de Azevedo, Dilvan/0000-0001-5715-8931; Bastos dos Santos, Joao Guilherme/0000-0002-4430-8985; Mitozo, Isabele/0000-0002-7627-306X; Rocha Barros, Samuel Anderson/0000-0001-8931-3262",,,,,34,1,1,0,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1933-1681,1933-169X,,J INF TECHNOL POLITI,J.

Compared to the government-run (party-state) forum, the nonpolitical (lifestyle and topical) forums created open and inclusive 'third spaces' for citizens to engage in child welfare politics. In such spaces, the reason, rule-based deliberation was not the dominant communicative practice. Rather, political (narrative) acts of complaining and sharing personal concerns - grounded in citizens' life experiences - were the norm, capturing and recognizing public problems in the private sphere. We argue that to understand the nature of political talk in Chinese third spaces, communicative acts that have not been considered central to deliberative reasoning, such as complaining and sharing personal concerns should be given more normative importance.","[Sun, Yu] Zhejiang Univ, Coll Media & Int Culture, Yuhangtang Rd 866, Hangzhou 310028, Peoples R China; [Graham, Todd] Univ Leeds, Polit Commun & Journalism, Sch Media & Commun, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England; [Broersma, Marcel] Univ Groningen, Media & Journalism Studies, Groningen, Netherlands; [Broersma, Marcel] Univ Groningen, Ctr Media & Journalism Studies, Groningen, Netherlands",,"Sun, Y (corresponding author), Zhejiang Univ, Coll Media & Int Culture, Yuhangtang Rd 866, Hangzhou 310028, Peoples R China.",celinasunyu@gmail.com; t.graham@leeds.ac.uk; m.j.broersma@rug.nl,,"Graham, Todd/0000-0002-5634-7623; Sun, Yu/0000-0001-7319-8933; Broersma, Marcel/0000-0002-7342-3472",,,,,53,1,1,1,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1933-1681,1933-169X,,J INF TECHNOL POLITI,J.

The findings of the study demonstrate that the network agenda of pro-attitudinal media was significantly correlated with both one's own and oppositional opinion repertoires for those who engaged in partisan selective exposure.

Our results show that individuals who are the most likely to have been exposed to political rhetoric have the strongest connection between their moral foundations and their attitudes on the issue.

The inclusion of a lame duck period is novel in studies on social networking sites and allows for more precise conclusions. In the routine period, politicians focused more on hard news, put more emphasis on domestic than foreign content on the country level, had a higher level of negative sentiment and published more tweets, whereas in the campaign period positive sentiment was higher. Additionally, we found large differences in politicians? tweeting behavior between the lame duck and routine period.

To fill this gap, we analyze a year of 1600 Daily content - The Official White House email style newsletter created by the Obama Administration and subsequently adopted after the Trump administration took office. In doing so, we identify the central frames the Trump White House relied on leading up to the 2020 election and the media sources used to legitimize these claims.

Drawing on domestication theory to apply a change-oriented perspective, the paper analyses how Norwegian local governments domesticate website technology to make websites and configure their users, based upon three empirical sources: a survey among information and communication technology managers in local governments, a quantitative mapping of the content of the websites of all 430 Norwegian local governments, and a qualitative in-depth content analysis of 10 websites. The findings show that domestication efforts vary a lot across local governments. However, all local governments engage in domestication.

We propose an accurate, fast, and scalable approach to multiple imputation, which we call MIDAS (Multiple Imputation with Denoising Autoencoders). MIDAS employs a class of unsupervised neural networks known as denoising autoencoders, which are designed to reduce dimensionality by corrupting and attempting to reconstruct a subset of data. We repurpose denoising autoencoders for multiple imputation by treating missing values as an additional portion of corrupted data and drawing imputations from a model trained to minimize the reconstruction error on the originally observed portion. Systematic tests on simulated as well as real social science data, together with an applied example involving a large-scale electoral survey, illustrate MIDAS's accuracy and efficiency across a range of settings. We provide open-source software for implementing MIDAS.","[Lall, Ranjit] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Int Relat, London, England; [Robinson, Thomas] Univ Durham, Sch Govt & Int Affairs, Durham, England",,"Lall, R (corresponding author), London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Int Relat, London, England.",r.lall@lse.ac.uk; thomas.robinson@durham.ac.uk,,"Robinson, Thomas/0000-0001-7097-1599; Lall, Ranjit/0000-0003-1455-3506",,,,,20,0,0,6,6,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1047-1987,1476-4989,,POLIT ANAL,Polit.

Yet successes with this method have largely been confined to massive corpora where the meanings of words are presumed to be fixed. In political science applications, however, many corpora are comparatively small and many interesting questions hinge on the recognition that meaning changes over time. Together, these two facts raise vexing methodological challenges. Can word vectors trace the changing cultural meanings of words in typical small corpora use cases? I test four time-sensitive implementations of word vectors (word2vec) against a gold standard developed from a modest data set of 161 years of newspaper coverage. I find that one implementation method clearly outperforms the others in matching human assessments of how public dialogues around equality in America have changed over time. In addition, I suggest best practices for using word2vec to study small corpora for time series questions, including bootstrap resampling of documents and pretraining of vectors. I close by showing that word2vec allows granular analysis of the changing meaning of words, an advance over other common text-as-data methods for semantic research questions.","[Rodman, Emma] Univ Washington, Dept Polit Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",,"Rodman, E (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Dept Polit Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",erodman@uw.edu,,,Center for American Politics and Public Policy (CAPPP) at the University of Washington; National Science Foundation [1243917],Center for American Politics and Public Policy (CAPPP) at the University of Washington; National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"This work was supported by the Center for American Politics and Public Policy (CAPPP) at the University of Washington and by the National Science Foundation [#1243917].

The analysis shows that disagreement over whether to increase or decrease taxes and spending are more divisive than disagreement over regulations and communication.

Our study compares these effect models, asking whether the explanations are complementary or competitive; it goes beyond previous studies by considering interactions between media cues and voters' attitudes. We draw on panel survey data from the German Longitudinal Election Study (GLES) that is combined with content analysis data of the main evening news broadcast in Germany. Findings show that visibility- and tonality-based effects are similar in potency, but tone-based effects are more contingent on attitudes toward parties and candidates. Both types of cues can backfire: higher visibility and more positive tonality can have negative effects on some attitude groups, which is in part moderated by the expectations about government coalitions. We find that visibility and tonality are rather complementary cues that both influence voting behavior.

Using the case of peanut allergy and drawing on qualitative content analysis of the public comments submitted in response to an unsuccessful 2010 U.S. Department of Transportation proposal to prohibit peanuts on airplanes, we analyze contention over the boundaries of responsibility for mitigating exposure to risk. We find three key dimensions of proximity to risk (material, social, and situational) characterizing ardent claims both for and against policy enactment. These proximity concerns underlay commenters' sensemaking about fear, trust, rights, moral obligations, and liberty in the act of sharing space with others, while allowing them to stake positions on what we call responsible sociality-an ethic of discernible empathy for proximate others and of consideration for public benefit in social and communal settings.

The concept denotes the processes through which data, people, experiences, and complex temporalities are ordered, woven together, and presented as coherent, frictionless narratives in the present. Through an analysis of the smartphone feature called Apple Memories, the paper seeks to highlight the narratives algorithms tell, how they are constructed, and the potential impacts they may have on everyday life. The concept of algorithmic emplotment is used to scrutinise the ways in which people's lives are rendered sequential, ordered, and ultimately meaningful and actionable by algorithmic processes.","[Jacobsen, Benjamin N.] Univ York, Wentworth Coll, Dept Sociol, Heslington YO10 5DD, England",,"Jacobsen, BN (corresponding author), Univ York, Wentworth Coll, Dept Sociol, Heslington YO10 5DD, England.",bnj500@york.ac.uk,,"Jacobsen, Benjamin/0000-0002-6656-8892",,,,,56,4,4,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

A large body of research focuses on developing generally applicable heuristics for more effective headline writing. In this work, we measure the importance of a number of theoretically motivated textual features to headline performance. Using a corpus of hundreds of thousands of headline A/B tests run by hundreds of news publishers, we develop and evaluate a machine-learned model to predict headline testing outcomes. We find that the model exhibits modest performance above baseline and further estimate an empirical upper bound for such content-based prediction in this domain, indicating an important role for non-content-based factors in test outcomes. Together, these results suggest that any particular headline writing approach has only a marginal impact, and that understanding reader behavior and headline context are key to predicting news attention decisions.","[Hagar, Nick; Diakopoulos, Nicholas] Northwestern Univ, Commun Studies, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [DeWilde, Burton] Chartbeat Inc, New York, NY USA",,"Diakopoulos, N (corresponding author), Northwestern Univ, Commun Studies, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",nad@northwestern.edu,,"Hagar, Nick/0000-0001-5110-3737; Diakopoulos, Nicholas/0000-0001-5005-6123",National Science Foundation Grant [IIS-1717330],National Science Foundation Grant(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"This work is supported by the National Science Foundation Grant, award IIS-1717330.",,69,0,0,3,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

After introducing the theme, the study deepens the political dimension of evaluation and unfolds its crucial connection with neoliberalisation. Then it focuses on the European case, with a qualitative content analysis of the indicators included in three datasets that the European Commission has created over time: the Digital Agenda Key Indicators (DAKI), the Lead indicators for DG Connect policy priorities, and the Digital Economy and Society Index (DESI).

This study fills this research gap by examining the effect of exposure to personalized coverage on the weight of party leader evaluations in the voting decision. Based on priming theory, exposure to personalized coverage is expected to make voters weigh leader evaluations more heavily in their vote decision. The study is based on a content analysis of the coverage of the 2010 Dutch election campaign and an 11-wave panel survey. Therewith the hypotheses are tested in a dynamic natural media environment. The analyses demonstrate that leader effects do occur. Voters use leader evaluations in their voting decision, even when controlling for the lagged vote, party evaluations, and issue agreement. Our data also support the hypothesis that personalized media coverage primes personalized voting behavior, even when controlling for learning and projection. Voters weigh leader evaluations more heavily in their vote decision and party evaluations and issue agreement less heavily when they are exposed to more personalized coverage.","[Takens, Janet; Kleinnijenhuis, Jan; Van Hoof, Anita; Van Atteveldt, Wouter] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Commun Sci, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands",,"Takens, J (corresponding author), Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Commun Sci, De Boelelaan 1081, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands.",janettakens@gmail.com,"Kleinnijenhuis, Jan/A-2048-2013; van Atteveldt, Wouter/L-8685-2013; van Hoof, Anita/L-8696-2013","Kleinnijenhuis, Jan/0000-0001-6231-8186; van Atteveldt, Wouter/0000-0003-1237-538X; van Hoof, Anita/0000-0002-0761-8036",,,,,51,26,27,3,34,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1058-4609,1091-7675,,POLIT COMMUN,Polit.

Findings on gatekeeping dynamics downsize optimistic views on the democratising potential of Twitter's socio-technical infrastructure as they point to the emergence of online satirical media and 'tweetstars' - along with mainstream news media- as main producers of spreadable content, with ordinary users only surfacing when traditional media elites and new satirical actors lack or lose interest in the debate. Results confirm that political hashtag publics follow acute event communication patterns, with users highly engaged in retweeting and referencing external material and visual content playing a key role in these gatewatching practices.

A total of 991,835 tweets were coded using the bag-of-words approach and supervised machine learning. The results showed that Clinton's moral framing during the 2016 presidential debates was generally associated with harm/care and fairness in the tweets, whereas Trump's moral framing was associated with ingroup loyalty and authority in the tweets. Interrupted time series analyses indicated that the effects of the debates on the moral words and self-transcendent emotions in the tweets were limited.

It is thus important to study the organisational structures and communication dynamics of these groups to provide insight into why they have been successful in recruiting members and how they further spread and normalise misogynistic beliefs. One such misogynistic group is MGTOW (Men Going Their Own Way). This study seeks to understand the structure and content of discussion within the forum of the official MGTOW website. To do so, it undertakes a content analysis of comments (n = 1012) inspired by Freelon's (2010, 2015) multi-norm approach to studying online communication, which draws on the liberal individual, communitarian and deliberative models. It also assesses the broader patterns of commenting (n = 628,745) participation amongst users (n = 33,863). The results suggest that debates on the forum combine elements of each communicative approach and that this reflects a contradiction in their underlying ideology of separation and individualism. In addition, it was found that topics of conversation primarily focused on two topics: women (the majority of which unfold in a misogynistic way) and defining MGTOW - both as a collective identity and a personal journey.","[Wright, Scott; Trott, Verity] Monash Univ, Sch Media Film & Journalism, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Jones, Callum] Monash Univ, Sch Social Sci, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",,"Wright, S (corresponding author), Monash Univ, Sch Media Film & Journalism, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.",scott.wright@monash.edu; verity.trott@monash.edu; cjo0@protonmail.com,"Jones, Callum/AAT-8327-2020","Jones, Callum/0000-0002-4269-4827; Wright, Scott/0000-0002-4087-9916",,,,,29,8,8,3,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

The inclusion of user-generated visual content by news organizations, especially at a time of newsroom contraction, has been a source of consternation for professional photojournalists, who have emphasized their professional training and skill. Though scholars have explored the perceptions photojournalists and citizen photographers have of photojournalism and of each other, little attention so far has been directed to the visual content of citizen photojournalism, the extent to which it adheres to established photojournalism conventions, and its incorporation by mainstream news organizations. This research addresses this absence. Drawing on a content analysis of user-generated images, this study finds that in a situation involving coverage of an ongoing story of significant impact in a community, there was little citizen photojournalism presented within the mainstream coverage. Further analysis reveals that while there is some overlap between events captured by professional and citizen photojournalists, the photographs made by citizens do not generally reflect the aesthetic standards expected of professionals. The results begin to provide practical examination of conceptual concerns expressed by photojournalists regarding the use of citizen-generated content.","[Greenwood, Keith; Thomas, Ryan J.] Univ Missouri, Missouri Sch Journalism, Columbia, MO 65211 USA",,"Greenwood, K (corresponding author), Univ Missouri, Missouri Sch Journalism, Columbia, MO 65211 USA.",greenwoodk@missouri.edu; thomasrj@missouri.edu,,,,,,,64,17,17,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

From a deliberative perspective, rational argumentation and critical reflection are central criteria for good discourse. Drawing on research on the perception of arguments and the conditions of disagreement, we ask how argument strength is linked to the likelihood of receiving (reasoned) disagreement and whether the discussion norms and technical features set by the news organizations moderate this effect. Based on a manual content analysis of 14.690 user comments on nine German news websites, we find that comments with a higher argument strength are more likely to receive disagreement in general and reasoned disagreement in particular. Further, the levels of (reasoned) disagreement are higher on platforms with strong discussion norms and supporting technical features. The results show that the quality of a discussion can be related to both users' argumentation and the decisions of the news organizations.","[Marzinkowski, Hanna; Engelmann, Ines] Friedrich Schiller Univ, Inst Commun Sci, Jena, Germany",,"Marzinkowski, H (corresponding author), Friedrich Schiller Univ, Inst Commun Sci, Jena, Germany.",hanna.marzinkowski@uni-jena.de,,"Marzinkowski, Hanna/0000-0002-8796-2346; Engelmann, Ines/0000-0002-3236-9895","German Research Foundation (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG) [EN 1117/1-1]","German Research Foundation (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG))","This work was supported by the German Research Foundation (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG) under Grant No. EN 1117/1-1.",,69,1,1,2,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

Within a period of seven weeks after the seaquake, the coverage in the four countries in 27 national newspapers and magazines on the three events was analyzed. As hypothesized from theory, German and Swiss media concentrated on Fukushima and stressed its relevance to domestic nuclear plants, whereas French and British media placed a greater emphasis on the tsunami and rarely related the nuclear catastrophe in Japan to domestic nuclear programs. In addition, there were remarkable correlations between the views of journalists and the bias of statements on nuclear energy presented in their news sections.

But so far only a few investigative stories have utilized AI methods, in relatively narrow ways. This paper surveys what has been accomplished in investigative reporting using AI techniques, why it has been difficult to apply more advanced methods, and what sorts of investigative journalism problems might be solved by AI in the near term. Journalism problems are often unique to a particular story, which means that training data is not readily available and the cost of complex models cannot be amortized over multiple projects. Much of the data relevant to a story is not publicly accessible but in the hands of governments and private entities, often requiring collection, negotiation, or purchase. Journalistic inference requires very high accuracy, or extensive manual checking, to avoid the risk of libel. The factors that make some set of facts newsworthy are deeply sociopolitical and therefore difficult to encode computationally. The biggest near-term potential for AI in investigative journalism lies in data preparation tasks, such as data extraction from diverse documents and probabilistic cross-database record linkage.","[Stray, Jonathan] Columbia Univ, Grad Sch Journalism, New York, NY 10027 USA",,"Stray, J (corresponding author), Columbia Univ, Grad Sch Journalism, New York, NY 10027 USA.",jonathan.stray@columbia.edu,,"Stray, Jonathan/0000-0003-4467-1239",,,,,63,22,26,13,65,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

Locative data also can create significant threats to personal privacy, legal due process, and ethical norms along the way. To determine how journalists, conceptualize the emergence and power of locative data, this research turns to organizational codes of ethics, as representative of public discourse in the field. This content analysis explored such discourse in more than 50 major U.S. news organizations, including examinations of public policies and terms of service. This analysis shows that fewer than half of the largest U.S. news organizations even publicly share a code of ethics, conveying transparency and leadership issues throughout the field.

In Malawi, external actors brought templates, provided financial and technical support and developed the policy with minimum involvement of local actors. We employed Bourdieu's Theory of Practice to examine the effect of the influences. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews and document analysis on selected policy documents from Malawi. The interviews were analyzed using thematic analysis. Content analysis, applied to policy documents from Botswana, Ghana, Malawi, Rwanda and South Africa, supplemented the investigation. We make two contributions related to national ICT policies in Africa. First, policies developed without involving local stakeholders are hardly implemented. Second, the study extends the application of Bourdieu's Theory of Practice in the ICT policy domain to show that the influences of external actors during ICT policymaking result in power imbalances in their favor. Through provision of economic, social and cultural capital, external actors dominate local actors during policymaking.

This question is probed looking at Germany and Ireland as two West European countries with highly different conditions. Drawing on party manifestos for the three most recent elections in the examined countries, the analysis maps parties' policy priorities in a common space. Instead of persisting differences in policy stances related to digital technologies, there is a clear trend of convergence between 2007 and 2017. Despite the very different country settings, parties in both countries, particularly in Germany, have shifted towards putting greater emphasis on aspects of productivity and efficiency. The findings suggest that adaptive pressures and the economic importance of digital technologies prevail over political-economic and socio-cultural country differences in shaping political actors' policy priorities.","[Koenig, Pascal D.] Univ Kaiserslautern, Dept Social Sci, Kaiserslautern, Germany",,"Konig, PD (corresponding author), Univ Kaiserslautern, Erwin Schrodinger Str,Bldg 57, D-67653 Kaiserslautern, Germany.",pascal.koenig@sowi.uni-kl.de,,"Konig, Pascal/0000-0001-9466-4024",,,,,71,0,0,4,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1933-1681,1933-169X,,J INF TECHNOL POLITI,J.

Results suggest that newspapers influenced Twitter before the announcement, whereas Twitter conversely influenced newspapers within five days after the announcement. However, Twitter's influence was found ephemeral, newspapers regained its unidirectional impact five days after the announcement.

Against this ideal, the quality of political news in online news outlets is highly contested. While pessimists point out the dangers of increased competition online, optimists emphasize the potential benefits of unlimited space and interactivity. To see which view holds true, this paper compares political news in popular and elite print newspapers and their respective online editions during the 2013 National Election Campaign in Austria. Findings show that online editions score better than paper editions regarding the amount of political news, (party) diversity, and emotionalization, but differences between newspaper types were notable. Whereas elite newspapers cover politics online more extensively than in print, the reverse is true for popular newspapers. Leader focus is also strong in popular papers online. We conclude that the gap in quality between political news in elite and in popular newspapers is larger online. This might contribute to a wider gap between a well-informed elite audience and a lesser-informed popular news audience, when audiences switch from print to online news.","[Jacobi, Carina] Univ Vienna, Dept Commun, A-1010 Vienna, Austria; [Kleinen-von Konigslow, Katharina] Univ Zurich, Inst Mass Commun, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland; [Ruigrok, Nel] Erasmus Univ, Sch Hist Culture & Commun, Rotterdam, Netherlands",,"Jacobi, C (corresponding author), Univ Vienna, Dept Commun, A-1010 Vienna, Austria.",carina.jacobi@univie.ac.at; k.kleinen@ipmz.uzh.ch; nelruigrok@nieuwsmonitor.org,"Konigslow, Katharina Kleinen-von/G-5377-2012","Kleinen-von Konigslow, Katharina/0000-0001-7700-9829",,,,,73,10,10,1,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

In the situation of uncertainty, emotions run high and might compromise the public acceptance of and compliance with countermeasures tackling the crisis. Mass media play an integral part in communicating crisis measures and provide an institutionalised channel to diffuse relevant information to a broad audience. This is especially true for digital outlets of legacy media given the greater immediacy of coverage. In addition, digital news offers the unique opportunity for readers to engage with the news contents, allowing an analysis of the dynamics of emotional reactions to crisis news coverage. We explore the case of Austria as an early COVID-19 hotspot. We analyse digital news coverage of two high-circulation newspapers and the emotionality it prompted in user comments, based on a unique dataset comprising 38,253 articles and around 1.6 Million comments from 1 January 2020 to 30 June 2020. Results show increased emotionality during lockdown and towards the government.

Common wisdom holds that lobbyists eschew the public spotlight and prefer to influence policymaking from behind the scenes. This perception contrasts with the literature on media and interest groups, which typically conceives of media attention as a crucial commodity for interest groups to influence policy decisions. This article unites these seemingly contrasting stances by arguing that media attention can be both a blessing and a curse for advocacy. The central argument posited is that media attention may improve or reduce advocacy groups' chances of preference attainment depending on how advocacy groups frame their message in the news. The analyses draw from interviews with more than 200 policy practitioners and content analysis of 3,557 media statements connected to a sample of 125 EU policy proposals. The findings demonstrate that an advocacy group's media presence may improve preference attainment, but only when the advocacy group manages to frame its objectives in the news as aligned with the public interest.","[De Bruycker, Iskander] Univ Antwerp, Res Fdn Flanders, Sint Jacobstr 2, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium",,"De Bruycker, I (corresponding author), Univ Antwerp, Res Fdn Flanders, Sint Jacobstr 2, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium.",Iskander.debruycker@uantwerpen.be,"De Bruycker, Iskander/AAA-3066-2022","De Bruycker, Iskander/0000-0002-8304-4257",Research Foundation Flanders (FWO) - European Science Foundation [12N1417N]; Research Foundation Flanders [10-ECRP-008];  [GA 171-11N],Research Foundation Flanders (FWO) - European Science Foundation; Research Foundation Flanders(FWO); ,The work presented in this article was made possible by a postdoctoral research grant [No. 12N1417N] from the Research Foundation Flanders (FWO) to Dr. Iskander De Bruycker.

A content analysis (n = 612) of all published news stories over two years in four international news databases revealed the potential of journalists to embrace data as an empirical tool, for the phrase was most frequently associated with numerical analysis. However, the next most-frequent definitional category was electoral prediction, which was statistically more likely in the nations where data journalism is most often practiced, the U.K. and U.S. Correlating data journalism with electoral prediction also was statistically more likely in the month immediately after the surprising elections. Further, it was more likely to stimulate pushback from practitioners who saw data as epistemologically less reliable than shoe-leather approaches marked by observation and interviews with a few people perceived to be voter archetypes. The results reveal more than journalistic ignorance about polling techniques. They reveal an element of news culture that privileges traditional methods and dismisses unfamiliar evidentiary tools, which risks skewing audience understanding of data journalism.","[Lewis, Norman P.; Waters, Stephenson] Univ Florida, Dept Journalism, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA",,"Lewis, NP (corresponding author), Univ Florida, Dept Journalism, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",nplewis@ufl.edu; stephensonwaters@ufl.edu,"Waters, Stephenson/K-9762-2019","Waters, Stephenson/0000-0001-7484-604X",,,,,82,14,14,2,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

Funded under the European Commission's Horizon 2020 programme, the system is analysed in relation to the wider political economy of 'emotional AI' and the history of deception detection technologies. We then move on to interrogate the design of iBorderCtrl using publicly available documents and assess the assumptions and scientific validation underpinning the project design. Finally, drawing on a Bayesian analysis we outline statistical fallacies in the foundational premise of mass screening and argue that it is very unlikely that the model that iBorderCtrl provides for deception detection would work in practice. By interrogating actual systems in this way, we argue that we can begin to question the very premise of the development of data-driven systems, and emotional AI and deception detection in particular, pushing back on the assumption that these systems are fulfilling the tasks they claim to be attending to and instead ask what function such projects carry out in the creation of subjects and management of populations. This function is not merely technical but, rather, we argue, distinctly political and forms part of a mode of governance increasingly shaping life opportunities and fundamental rights.","[Sanchez-Monedero, Javier; Dencik, Lina] Cardiff Univ, Sch Journalism Media & Culture, Two Cent Sq,Cent Sq, Cardiff CF10 1FS, Wales",,"Sanchez-Monedero, J (corresponding author), Cardiff Univ, Sch Journalism Media & Culture, Two Cent Sq,Cent Sq, Cardiff CF10 1FS, Wales.",Sanchez-monederoJ@cardiff.ac.uk,"Sanchez-Monedero, Javier/K-8621-2014","Sanchez-Monedero, Javier/0000-0001-8649-1709",European Research Council (ERC) [759903],European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)European Commission),This work was supported by a Starting Grant from the European Research Council (ERC) under grant number 759903.,,51,8,8,3,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

Drawing on a combination of quantitative visual content analysis (VCA) and in-depth visual analysis focused on iconography and symbolism, we explore all memes (N = 634) created and circulated by the group around the 2018 general elections in the country. The analysis proceeds in two steps: First, we present the results of the VCA in which we identified five thematic categories of memes crafting white supremacy, xenophobia, homophobia, misogyny and anti-Semitic ideas onto esoteric and popular culture iconography then to map these across a matrix of content and form. We then proceed to the analysis of the cluster of memes coded as violent to explore the iconography and symbolism used to promote violence and death threats and render them banal. We draw on a range of recent scholarship on the entanglement of memes in the rise of the far-right and engage critical perspectives on the necropower of fascism to explore the interplay between ambiguous, playful and jokey imagery on the one hand and the murder fantasies and serious threat of white supremacist violence at the heart of neo-Nazi ideology, on the other.","[Askanius, Tina; Keller, Nadine] Malmo Univ, Sch Arts & Commun, Dept Media & Commun Studies, Box 50500, S-20250 Malmo, Sweden",,"Askanius, T (corresponding author), Malmo Univ, Sch Arts & Commun, Dept Media & Commun Studies, Box 50500, S-20250 Malmo, Sweden.",tina.askanius@mau.se,"Askanius, Tina/CAF-8203-2022",,Marianne and Marcus Wallenberg Foundation [MMW.2016.0018]; Myndigheten for Samhallsskydd och Beredskap fA r SamhAllsskydd och Beredskap [1MS-002],Marianne and Marcus Wallenberg Foundation; Myndigheten for Samhallsskydd och Beredskap fA r SamhAllsskydd och Beredskap,This work was supported by Marianne and Marcus Wallenberg Foundation [MMW.2016.0018] and Myndigheten for Samhallsskydd och Beredskap fA r SamhAllsskydd och Beredskap [1MS-002].,,36,0,0,3,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

Much of this literature has focused on politicians running for office and women who hold legislative office. Little research investigates gendered news media presentations of women as heads of government. While the literature predicts that women heads of government should experience gendered differences in news coverage, there is also good reason to expect that news about government operations should not vary based on the gender of the government leader. Using their first year of online news coverage (N = 11,675), we build a series of dictionaries and use automated content analysis to assess how frequently heads of government's uniqueness, gender, family, appearance, sexual orientation, character, and competence are presented. We also assess the tone of news about each head of government. Results show that gendered coverage exists for women heads of government in potentially surprising ways. Fewer new stories are written about them, on average, than men. Women's coverage features more feminine and masculine gendered identifies, as well as more coverage about their clothing. We find little evidence for increased personalization, and women's character and competence are presented more positively than men's. Though blunt, this analysis shows that news about heads of government remains gendered.","[Thomas, Melanee] Univ Calgary, Polit Sci, Calgary, AB, Canada; [Harell, Allison; Gosselin, Tania] Univ Quebec Montreal, Polit Sci, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Rijkhoff, Sanne A.

Du Bois 2014; Tantucci et al. 2018), naturalistic interaction is inherently grounded in resonance, viz. the catalytic activation of affinities across turns (Du Bois and Giora 2014). Resonance occurs dynamically when interlocutors creatively coconstruct utterances that are formally and phonetically similar to the utterance of a prior speaker. In this study, we argue that such similarity can inform the machine learning prediction of linguistic and crosscultural diversity. We compared two sets of 1,000 exchanges involving (dis)agreement from the two balanced Callhome corpora of naturalistic interaction in Mandarin Chinese and American English. We found a correlation of overt use of pragmatic markers with resonance, indicating that priming does not occur as an exclusively implicit mechanism (as it is commonly held in the experimental literature e.g. Bock 1986; Bock et al. 2007), but naturalistically underpins dialogic engagement and cooperation among interactants. We fitted a mixed effects linear regression and a hierarchical clustering model to show that resonance occurs formally and functionally in different ways from one language to another. The applied results of this study can lead to a novel turn in AI research of conversational interfaces (McTear et al. 2016; Klopfenstein et al. 2017), as they reveal the fundamental role played cross-linguistically by resonance as a form of engagement of human-to-human interaction and the importance to address this mechanism in machine-to-human communication.","[Tantucci, Vittorio] Univ Lancaster, Dept Linguist & English Language, Lancaster, England; [Wang, Aiqing] Univ Lancaster, Dept Languages & Cultures, Lancaster, England",,"Tantucci, V (corresponding author), Univ Lancaster, Dept Linguist & English Language, Lancaster, England.",v.tantucci@lancaster.ac.uk,,,,,,,168,3,3,0,0,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0142-6001,1477-450X,,APPL LINGUIST,Appl.

This paper presents a case study of online deliberation in academia using a framework including three analytical parts: a design fostering deliberation (institutional inputs), the quality of the communication process (communicative throughput), and the expected benefits of deliberation (productive outcomes). Each level addressed in the framework is both rooted in deliberative theory and complemented by empirical findings. Applying the framework to a case study on online deliberation about new PhD guidelines in a German science faculty demonstrates that the framework is viable for empirical research. In analyzing 435 comments and an online survey completed by 230 participants, the case study reveals that if deliberative standards at the institutional input level are met there is considerable deliberative quality at the level of communicative throughput, and expected outcomes could thus emerge. This example makes a case for further online deliberation initiatives in similar contexts such as parties or organizations that must decide on important issues or legally binding norms.","[Friess, Dennis M.] Heinrich Heine Univ Dusseldorf, Inst Social Sci, Commun, Dusseldorf, Germany",,"Friess, DM (corresponding author), Univ Dusseldorf, Heinrich Heine Univ, Inst Philosophie, Social Sci, Univ Str 1, D-40225 Dusseldorf, Germany.",dennis.friess@phil.hhu.de,,,,,,,93,2,2,2,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1933-1681,1933-169X,,J INF TECHNOL POLITI,J.

Ohio ranks second among states in drug overdose deaths, with more than 39 deaths for every 100,000 people. In light of this, opioid addiction and related issues have garnered substantial media attention. However, few studies have examined the content and framing of opioid-related media coverage or explored ways that audiences react to coverage of the crisis within their communities. This study attempts to fill this gap through an analysis of opioid-related posts and comments on the public-facing Facebook pages of 42 Ohio newspapers between 2013 and 2017 (N=397). Content analysis was used to identify frames in posted newspaper content and themes in comments. Four frames were identified in posted stories: (1) Awareness of the Opioid Epidemic and Affected Populations (34.0% of all posted content; n=135); (2) Programs, Policies, and Interventions (29.5%; n=117); (3) Crime, Punishment, Legal Cases, and Law Enforcement (28.2%; n=112); and (4) Narratives of Addiction and the Long Road to Recovery (8.3%; n=33). Analyses of Facebook user comments on posted newspaper content revealed five themes: Emotion and Support, Choice and Responsibility, Disease and Treatment, Worthiness, and Attention and Action. Findings indicate both the intensive and diverse efforts of newspapers to cover the epidemic as well as the varied reactions of community members to opioid use and addiction.","[Russell, David; Thames, Kelly M.] Appalachian State Univ, Dept Sociol, ASU Box 32115,209 Chapell Wilson Hall, Boone, NC 28608 USA; [Spence, Naomi J.] CUNY, Dept Sociol, Lehman Coll, Bronx, NY USA",,"Russell, D (corresponding author), Appalachian State Univ, Dept Sociol, ASU Box 32115,209 Chapell Wilson Hall, Boone, NC 28608 USA.",russelldj@appstate.edu,"Russell, David/AAZ-6102-2020","Russell, David/0000-0001-8433-0821; Spence, Naomi/0000-0002-0724-9429",,,,,7,7,7,2,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

This contribution aims to deepen the relationships among gender, sexuality, and media, through the analysis of a specific case study based on the Fertility Day campaign, an initiative launched by the Italian Ministry of Health to draw attention to the country's fertility and counteract the falling birth rates. The campaign intended to encourage couples to have more sex and conceive more babies, focusing on 'the beauty of maternity and paternity'. But the campaign was denounced as being offensive, sexist, and ageist, triggering numerous online reactions. In this paper we present the findings of a content analysis of 5,300 public tweets characterized by the hashtag #fertilityday. These data show how hundreds of citizens used the campaign's hashtag to construct a counter-narrative around the right and the choice to have a baby (Vicari et al., 2018. Political hashtag publics and counter-visibility: A case study of #fertilityday in Italy.Information, Communication & Society, 1-19. https://doi.org/10.1080/1369118X.2018.1555271). We focused our attention on how female users narratively reframed the institutional discourse, shifting the topic from the problem of 'fertility', in a strict sense, to the importance of welfare policies capable of supporting maternity and facilitating gender equality. We consider this case study as emblematic for its power of being an indicator of progress in public discourse on the sociocultural construction of the role of women.","[Micalizzi, Alessandra] SAE Inst, Cultural Studies Dept, Milan, Italy",,"Micalizzi, A (corresponding author), SAE Inst, Cultural Studies Dept, Milan, Italy.",a.micalizzi@sae.edu,"Micalizzi, Alessandra/ABA-3283-2020","Micalizzi, Alessandra/0000-0002-6467-3023",,,,,49,0,0,4,21,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

In the digital era, this struggle is manifested in the work of civil-society organizations calling to expand the boundaries of digital rights such as access to the internet, freedom of speech, and the right to privacy. Alongside their traditional activity of confronting governments and internet organizations, these bodies have also engaged in educating citizens about their rights. In order to shed light on such educational efforts, I examine the activities of four civil-society organizations operating in three countries (Germany, Israel, and the U.S.) by conducting a content analysis of their websites between 2013 and 2015. The results suggest that the organizations' interactions with the public are guided by three main principles: (1) cultural informational framing: delivering accurate technological and political information, which is framed so as to resonate with the cultural premises and everyday lives of the target audiences; (2) personal activism: propelling citizens toward participation, primarily through political clicktivism and by providing them with technological guidance and tools for digital self-protection; and (3) branding digital rights activism: fostering a unique image for a particular organization's digital rights activism, mostly through selling merchandise to citizens. Using these strategies, the organizations aim to construct the social-political-cultural identity of a generation who are knowledgeable, politically active, and aware of their rights in the digital age. The characteristics of this identity are discussed in the conclusion.","[Daskal, Efrat] Open Univ Israel, Dept Sociol Polit Sci & Commun, Derekh Ha Univ 1, IL-4353701 Raanana, Israel",,"Daskal, E (corresponding author), Open Univ Israel, Dept Sociol Polit Sci & Commun, Derekh Ha Univ 1, IL-4353701 Raanana, Israel.",efrat.daskal@mail.huji.ac.il,,,Open University of Israel,Open University of Israel,This study was made possible through the support of the Open University of Israel.,,68,11,13,1,23,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

Recent research has examined how digital technologies may multiply the involvement of remote, non-present and unanticipated actors in the witnessing of events. This paper examines what digital data practices at Amnesty International's Decoders initiative can add to the understanding of witnessing. It introduces the notion of data witnessing' with reference to four projects on (i) witnessing historical abuses with structured data from digitised documents; (ii) witnessing the destruction of villages with satellite imagery and machine learning; (iii) witnessing environmental injustice with company reports and photographs; and (iv) witnessing online abuse through the classification of Twitter data. These projects illustrate the configuration of experimental apparatuses for witnessing injustices with data. In contrast to accounts which emphasise the presence of an individual human witness at the scene, Amnesty's data practices are conspicuously collective and distributed, rendering the systemic scale of injustices at a distance, across space and time. Such practices may contribute to research on both (new) media witnessing and data politics, suggesting ways in which care, concern and solidarity may be constructed, structured, extended and delimited by means of digital data.","[Gray, Jonathan] Kings Coll London, Dept Digital Humanities, Crit Infrastruct Studies, London, England",,"Gray, J (corresponding author), Kings Coll London, Dept Digital Humanities, London, England.",jonathan.gray@kcl.ac.uk,,"Gray, Jonathan/0000-0001-6668-5899",,,,,97,10,10,2,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

The article conceptualizes the relationship between learning algorithms, neuroscience, and the new learning spaces of the city by combining the notion of programmable 'code/space' with ideas about the 'social life of the brain' to suggest that new kinds of 'brain/code/spaces' are being developed where the environment itself is imagined to possess brain-like functions of learning and 'human qualities' of cognition performed by algorithmic processes. IBM's ambitions for education constitute a sociotechnical imaginary of a 'cognitive classroom' where the practices associated with data analytics and cognitive computing in the smart city are being translated into the neuropedagogic brain/code/spaces of the school, with significant consequences for how learners are to be addressed and acted upon. The IBM imaginary of Smarter Education is one significant instantiation of emerging smart cities that are to be governed by neurocomputational processes modelled on neuroscientific insights into the brain's plasticity for learning, and part of a 'neurofuture' in-the-making where nonconscious algorithmic 'computing brains' embedded in urban space are intended to interact with human cognition and brain functioning.","[Williamson, Ben] Univ Stirling, Sch Social Sci, Stirling FK9 4LA, Scotland",,"Williamson, B (corresponding author), Univ Stirling, Sch Social Sci, Stirling FK9 4LA, Scotland.",ben.williamson@stir.ac.uk,,"Williamson, Ben/0000-0001-9356-3213",Economic and Social Research Council [ES/L001160/1]; ESRC [ES/L001160/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),This research was supported with a grant from the Economic and Social Research Council [ref: ES/L001160/1]: https://codeactsineducation.wordpress.com/,,53,13,13,2,75,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

Do they utilise their independence to display actors that are underrepresented in the mainstream news? And does it affect the actor diversity in their news coverage and the journalistic environment as a whole? This study scrutinises the differences in actor diversity and actor presentation in articles published by alternative and mainstream news media to gauge if alternative media are more one-sided and if they contribute to the external actor diversity of the news environment. We analyse a sample of news articles on migration and social affairs published by two mainstream media and four alternative outlets. Despite limited differences in article-level actor diversity between alternative and mainstream news media, our findings highlight that right-wing and left-wing alternative media exploit their editorial independence differently to highlight other actor categories. Left-wing alternative news media present more civil society actors, while right-wing alternative news outlets pay more attention to right-wing politicians and parties. Thus, alternative news media are not that different in terms of internal actor diversity, but they modestly advance the external actor diversity in the news environment.","[Buyens, Willem; Van Aelst, Peter] Univ Antwerp, Antwerp, Belgium",,"Buyens, W (corresponding author), Univ Antwerp, Antwerp, Belgium.",willem.buyens@uantwerpen.be,"van aelst, peter/E-2285-2019","van aelst, peter/0000-0002-2548-0309",Research Foundation -Flanders (FWO) [S008817N],Research Foundation -Flanders (FWO)(FWO),This research was supported by Research Foundation -Flanders (FWO) under Grant S008817N.,,52,0,0,11,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

It distinguishes between a journalistic logic, in which referencing practices follow established journalistic ways of ensuring facticity and context, and a movement logic, in which references are used to obtain political, movement-oriented goals of dismissing opponents, supporting your allies, multiplying forces and building a community. Based on a manual quantitative content analysis of more than 4,500 references extracted from 1,000 randomly selected articles by 20 right-wing alternative news media from six countries (US, UK, Germany, Austria, Sweden, Denmark), the article shows that alternative news media predominantly follow a journalistic logic in their referencing practices, though at the expense of a limited originality of sources. Despite their anti-mainstream ambition, alternative news media frequently refer to mainstream media, but only rarely dismiss or re-frame content published by these media. The article discusses these practices as an expression of the hybrid nature of alternative news media situated at the boundary between journalism and political activism. Moreover, it addresses broader implications for the relationship between alternative and mainstream journalistic practice in the digital realm.","[Mayerhoffer, Eva; Heft, Annett] Roskilde Univ, Dept Commun & Arts, Roskilde, Denmark; [Heft, Annett] Free Univ Berlin, Inst Media & Commun Studies, Berlin, Germany; [Heft, Annett] Weizenbaum Inst Networked Soc, Berlin, Germany",,"Mayerhoffer, E (corresponding author), Roskilde Univ, Dept Commun & Arts, Roskilde, Denmark.",evamay@ruc.dk,,"Mayerhoffer, Eva/0000-0002-4644-9060",German Federal Ministry of Education and Research [16DII114],German Federal Ministry of Education and Research(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),"This work was supported by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research, funding code 16DII114.",,40,3,3,3,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

This imbalance raises an important question: if a campaign invests more resources in an area, can it earn positive media coverage? In this article, I propose a strategic relationship between campaigns and local media. Newspapers offer campaigns credibility and exposure, while campaigns offer local newspapers easy-to-report stories that will appeal to their readers. Campaign messages are more impactful when communicated through the local press, so campaigns will try to influence local news coverage (when they have the resources to do so) by establishing a local presence. When newspapers are vulnerable, they should be more likely to accept campaign prompting and provide campaigns with positive earned media. I employ an original data set of newspaper content and campaign investment from the 2004 and 2008 elections. I utilize a within-state matched-pairs design of newspapers from the state of Florida and a detailed content analysis of stories from 21 randomly selected days from each election cycle. I find that regional campaign presence generates positive earned media, but only in smaller newspapers. This article contributes to the fields of campaign and media effects by demonstrating how campaigns' calculated decisions influence the construction of local political news. It is the first study to describe the connection between the voter contact and campaigns' earned local media strategy.","[Darr, Joshua P.] Louisiana State Univ, Manship Sch Mass Commun, Dept Polit Sci, 211 Journalism Bldg, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA",,"Darr, JP (corresponding author), Louisiana State Univ, Manship Sch Mass Commun, Dept Polit Sci, 211 Journalism Bldg, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA.",jdarr@lsu.edu,"Darr, Joshua/AAV-9533-2020","Darr, Joshua/0000-0002-0388-5559",,,,,44,10,10,3,13,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1058-4609,1091-7675,,POLIT COMMUN,Polit.

Usually, this research compares male and female politicians from a female perspective. For instance, many studies in political communication investigate how and why female candidates show campaign styles similar to or different from their male colleagues. In contrast to this, few studies are interested in how men change their behavior when women enter the political arena. Some of these studies have demonstrated that men limit their negativity when confronted with female candidates. Unfortunately, these analyses focus predominantly on (a) the United States and (b) gender differences in campaign advertising. We seek to provide empirical evidence for non-U.S. campaigns from the most important single campaign events: televised debates. To do so, we analyze data covering all German televised debates broadcast since 1997 where male politicians participated in a two-candidate single- or mixed-gender debate. Our results indicate that the gender of the political opponent affects incivility but not the use of attacks in general. In mixed-gender debates there is less incivility. However, differences in the treatment of male and female opponents tend to decline over time. We conclude that female candidates transform campaign communicationnot only because they communicate differently from men, but also because they influence male politicians' political communication.","[Maier, Juergen] Univ Koblenz Landau, Dept Polit Sci, Polit Commun, Landau, Germany; [Renner, Anna-Maria] Univ Koblenz Landau, Grad Sch Gender Res, Landau, Germany",,"Maier, J (corresponding author), Univ Koblenz Landau, Dept Polit Sci, Kaufhausgasse 9, D-76829 Landau, Germany.",maierj@uni-landau.de,"Maier, Jürgen/ABH-7963-2020","Maier, Jürgen/0000-0001-8301-5125",,,,,79,9,9,0,12,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1058-4609,1091-7675,,POLIT COMMUN,Polit.

Levels of autonomy of media from politics and the extent of commercialization pressure are considered particularly important. However, most studies investigate differences between countries and the passing of time as proxies and qualitatively infer which structural conditions might account for the level of mediatization. The current study goes beyond these proxies. It reviews and systematizes how structural autonomy from political institutions and extent of commercialization pressure influences the importance of media logic in media coverage and operationalizes these influences in a comparative analysis of election campaign coverage in Germany and Austria over 60 years. A multi-level analysis finds that between-country differences and within-country changes in macro- and meso-level autonomy from politics/commercialization pressure account for a large part of the time/space (campaign/country) variation of the importance of media logic. It complements earlier research (1) by demonstrating that between-country differences and within-country changes in media coverage reflect underlying media structures; (2) by specifying which structural influences (representing the media's autonomy from politics and commercialization pressure) are most important in shaping the importance of media logic in campaign coverage.","[Magin, Melanie; Geiss, Stefan] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol NTNU, Trondheim, Norway",,"Magin, M (corresponding author), Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol NTNU, Dept Sociol & Polit Sci, Bygg 9, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway.",melanie.magin@ntnu.no,"Geiß, Stefan/AAA-6903-2019","Magin, Melanie/0000-0003-2545-3594",Austrian Science Fund [P20147-G14],Austrian Science Fund(Austrian Science Fund (FWF)),This work was supported by the Austrian Science Fund [P20147-G14].,,46,3,3,1,19,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1058-4609,1091-7675,,POLIT COMMUN,Polit.

We argue that campaign learning is not only contingent on voters' characteristics and different sources of information, but also on how parties communicate their issue positions in election debates. We combine a two-wave panel survey with content analysis data of three televised election debates. In cross-classified multilevel auto-regression models we examine the influence of these debates in the 2010 Dutch parliamentary election campaign on voters' knowledge of the positions of eight parties on three issues. The Dutch multiparty system allows us to separate voters' ability to position parties from their accuracy in ordering these parties. We reach three main conclusions. First, this study shows that voters become more able and accurate during the campaign. However, these campaign learning effects erode after the elections. Second, whereas voters' attention to campaigns consistently contributes to their ability to position parties, its effect on accuracy is somewhat less consistent. Third, televised election debates contribute to what voters learn. Parties that advocate their issue positions in the debates stimulate debate viewers' ability to position these parties on these issues. In the face of the complexity of campaigns and debates in multiparty systems, campaigns are more likely to boost voters' subjective ability to position parties than their accuracy.","[van der Meer, Tom W.

In the evolving and participatory media-politics landscape, it becomes important to ask how the cross-disciplinary project of political communication research is keeping pace with changing conditions that provide a greater structural role for the press in politics and new technology in the enactment of citizenship. To track these trends in research, this paper reports the results of a longitudinal content analysis of research articles published in the journals Political Communication and the International Journal of Press/Politics for the period 1996-2016. For each year, we selected one issue at random and examined all research articles in that issue, excluding reviews, invited theme essays, and commentaries. Altogether, 229 articles were included in the analysis. Results indicate a noticeable increase in the internationalization of political communication research over the 20-year analysis period, a slight decrease in research expressing a negative evaluative tone toward the media over time, and consistent growth in the percentage of articles with a media-centric focus, defined as positioning the press as a central consideration in the study and regarding news media as central to democratic life. In light of these findings, the unique interpretive lenses that researchers adopt depending on discipline are explored in relation to ongoing developments in political communication research.","[Bucy, Erik P.] Texas Tech Univ, Coll Media & Commun, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA; [Evans, Heather K.] Univ Virginias Coll Wise, Dept Polit Sci, Wise, WV USA",,"Bucy, EP (corresponding author), Texas Tech Univ, Coll Media & Commun, Strateg Commun, 3003 15th St, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA.",erik.bucy@ttu.edu,,"Bucy, Erik/0000-0003-4925-2244",,,,,24,1,1,8,20,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1058-4609,1091-7675,,POLIT COMMUN,Polit.

Such statistical models have been criticized in the existing literature especially for producing cultural biases and for challenging our notions of knowledge. However, few studies have contributed to an essential understanding of the way in which algorithms are designed with particular truths to enable systematic decision-making. Drawing on an ethnographic study in a Scandinavian AI company, this article analyzes how truth is built through layered interpretative practices in applied AI for healthcare, and critically assesses how such practices shed light on the pragmatic notion of truth(s) in AI. The study identifies five practices that all show difficulty in modeling fuzzy patient conditions into one firm truth. The key contribution is that truth goes from being a process of discovering a more 'right' truth to become a process of reinventing the existing truth and healthcare practice. These findings suggest that truth in applied AI is a key devise for making predictive algorithms a viable business, and that developers are in a favorable position to make not only AI doable but also the very truth they intend to find and model. The study in this way shows how change is an inherent part of making AI systems, and that centralizing truth practices is a fruitful way of analyzing such changes and developers' agency. We argue for analytical awareness of how AI truth practices may prompt a world that is fit to algorithms rather than a world to which algorithms are fit.","[Henriksen, Anne; Bechmann, Anja] Aarhus Univ, Media & Journalism Studies, Aarhus, Denmark; [Bechmann, Anja] Univ Antwerp, Polit Sci, Antwerp, Belgium",,"Henriksen, A (corresponding author), Aarhus Univ, Media & Journalism Studies, Aarhus, Denmark.",annehenriksen@cc.au.dk,,"Bechmann, Anja/0000-0002-5588-5155",Aarhus University; Aarhus University Research Foundation [AUFF-E-2015-FLS-8-55],Aarhus University; Aarhus University Research Foundation,Funding for the research has been granted from Aarhus University and Aarhus University Research Foundation grant number AUFF-E-2015-FLS-8-55.,,52,6,6,6,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

In this approach, an algorithm learns to classify topics in a labeled source corpus and then extrapolates topics in an unlabeled target corpus from another domain. The ability to use existing training data makes this method significantly more efficient than within-domain supervised learning. It also has three advantages over unsupervised topic models: the method can be more specifically targeted to a research question and the resulting topics are easier to validate and interpret. We demonstrate the method using the case of labeled party platforms (source corpus) and unlabeled parliamentary speeches (target corpus). In addition to the standard within-domain error metrics, we further validate the cross-domain performance by labeling a subset of target-corpus documents. We find that the classifier accurately assigns topics in the parliamentary speeches, although accuracy varies substantially by topic. We also propose tools diagnosing cross-domain classification. To illustrate the usefulness of the method, we present two case studies on how electoral rules and the gender of parliamentarians influence the choice of speech topics.","[Osnabruegge, Moritz] Univ Durham, Sch Govt & Int Affairs, Durham, England; [Ash, Elliott] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Ctr Law & Econ, Zurich, Switzerland; [Morelli, Massimo] Bocconi Univ, Dept Social & Polit Sci, Milan, Italy",,"Osnabrugge, M (corresponding author), Univ Durham, Sch Govt & Int Affairs, Durham, England.",moritz.osnabruegge@durham.ac.uk; ashe@ethz.ch; massimo.morelli@unibocconi.it,,"Osnabrugge, Moritz/0000-0002-6177-1111",European Research Council [694583],European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC)European Commission),This work was supported by the European Research Council (advanced grant 694583).,,46,3,3,6,6,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1047-1987,1476-4989,,POLIT ANAL,Polit.

Missing from the literature is an examination of the relationship between strategy framing in news and electoral success, the actual goal of political campaigns. Similarly, factors that shape media use of strategy framing on the candidate and race levels were rarely examined. We argue that these gaps in knowledge are due to taxing coding procedures required for systematic estimation of strategy framing in large corpora. We use a recently developed unsupervised computational method (ANTMN) to automatically code the news coverage of 312 U.S. Senate candidates in 156 races between 2008 and 2016 in a corpus of 181,725 articles. We found that strategy framing is negatively associated with electoral success.

We also provide software to ease the use of this data collection method. In an illustrative application, we collect textual content from the websites of over two hundred municipal governments in the United States, and study how website content is associated with mayoral partisanship. Using statistical topic modeling, we find that the partisanship of the mayor predicts differences in the contents of city websites that align with differences in the platforms of Democrats and Republicans.

From a substantive point of view, the integratability of the approach into comparative study designs is tested. For this, the online discourses about climate change in Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States are compared. First, the results show that the approach is relatively robust and second, that integration in comparative study designs is not a problem.

Anti-establishment rhetoric before and after government participation,INFORMATION COMMUNICATION & SOCIETY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Populism; Facebook video; text analysis; political language; election campaign,RADICAL RIGHT; POPULISM; PARTIES; TWITTER; EUROPE; SYSTEM,"Scholars argued that anti-establishment parties use a populist rhetoric that appeals to the worst instincts of people. Indeed, populist politicians are often viewed as charismatic leaders that have fire in their belly. While in the past these parties heavily relied on anti-establishment platforms and communication rhetoric, their increasing electoral success along with the growing duties linked with government membership transform them into more established parties, rather than pure outsiders, and cast doubts on the feasibility of keeping a populist rhetoric. This paper compares right-wing and non-right-wing populism, investigating whether populist leaders change their rhetorical strategy once in office, decreasing the level of negativity and adopting a more forward-looking and inclusive style of communication, with a stronger focus on fulfilling the policy proposal made during the electoral campaign rather than blaming political rivals. For this purpose, we collected a new corpus of political speeches extracted from video messages posted on Facebook by four anti-establishment party leaders in three countries (Austria, Italy and Spain), from 2016 to 2018, i.e., immediately before and immediately after their access to power. Overall, 30 h of recorded audio from 215 videos (amounting to around 140 million visualizations) have been analyzed using topic models and well-established semantic psycholinguistic dictionaries. The results highlight slight changes in the rhetoric of populist leaders once in power, mostly for non-right-wing populists, as their language becomes less negative, less assertive and more focused on government duties.","[Ceron, Andrea; Gandini, Alessandro; Lodetti, Patrizio] Univ Milan, Dipartimento Sci Sociali & Polit, Via Pass 13, I-20122 Milan, Italy",,"Ceron, A (corresponding author), Univ Milan, Dipartimento Sci Sociali & Polit, Via Pass 13, I-20122 Milan, Italy.",andrea.ceron@unimi.it; alessandro.gandini@unimi.it; patrizio.lodetti@unimi.it,,"Ceron, Andrea/0000-0002-6686-5969; Gandini, Alessandro/0000-0002-7705-7625",,,,,42,3,3,1,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

To unveil the plenary agenda and detect latent themes in legislative speeches over time, MEP speech content is analyzed using a new dynamic topic modeling method based on two layers of Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF). This method is applied to a new corpus of all English language legislative speeches in the EP plenary from the period 1999 to 2014. Our findings suggest that two-layer NMF is a valuable alternative to existing dynamic topic modeling approaches found in the literature, and can unveil niche topics and associated vocabularies not captured by existing methods. Substantively, our findings suggest that the political agenda of the EP evolves significantly over time and reacts to exogenous events such as EU Treaty referenda and the emergence of the Euro Crisis.

While a growing number of media and communication studies projects have applied these techniques to corpuses of born-digital journalism, using the same tools to analyse large-scale collections of historical newspapers requires us to overcome additional technological and methodological challenges. Our discussion is framed around a historical case study examining references to the United States in the 19th Century British Library Newspaper Archive. The article begins by highlighting the problems that researchers of both digital and historical journalism face when attempting to deal with an enormous body of evidence. Next, it argues that Topic Modelling offers one potential solution to these problems by providing a way to distant read the archive. The remainder of the article is divided into five experiments that demonstrate how Topic Modelling can be applied to a series of research questions, each of which is applicable to other projects that might make use of newspaper archives.

However, in practice the hope that the dominant source of variation in their data is the quantity of interest is often not realized. In this paper, I argue that in the messy world of speeches we have to rely on supervised approaches that include information on party affiliation in order to produce meaningful estimates of polarization. To substantiate this argument, I introduce a validation framework that may be used to comparatively assess supervised and unsupervised methods, and estimate polarization on the basis of 6.2 million records of parliamentary speeches from the UK House of Commons over the period 1811-2015. Beyond introducing several important adjustments to existing estimation approaches, the paper's methodological contribution therefore consists of outlining the challenges of applying unsupervised estimation techniques to speech data, and arguing in detail why we should instead rely on supervised methods to measure polarization.","[Goet, Niels D.] Inspera AS, Oslo, Norway",,"Goet, ND (corresponding author), Inspera AS, Oslo, Norway.",ndgoet@gmail.com,"Goet, Niels/AAR-7137-2020","Goet, Niels/0000-0001-9937-0885",,,,,42,7,7,6,14,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1047-1987,1476-4989,,POLIT ANAL,Polit.

But how does the economic news track the welfare of different income groups in an era of rising inequality? Whose economy does the news cover? Drawing on a large new dataset of US news content, we demonstrate that the tone of the economic news strongly and disproportionately tracks the fortunes of the richest households, with little sensitivity to income changes among the non-rich. Further, we present evidence that this pro-rich bias emerges not from pro-rich journalistic preferences but, rather, from the interaction of the media's focus on economic aggregates with structural features of the relationship between economic growth and distribution. The findings yield a novel explanation of distributionally perverse electoral patterns and demonstrate how distributional biases in the economy condition economic accountability.","[Jacobs, Alan M.] Univ British Columbia, Dept Polit Sci, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Matthews, J.

We build upon public sphere and alternative media theory to discuss the relevance of alternative media for the US (far-)right and whether the election period and the candidate Trump allowed far-right alternative media to establish themselves in the (far-) right networked public sphere. We investigate whether it has come to a convergence of topics between the right and the extreme far-right. We analyze the topics nine right-wing outlets, ranging from Fox News to the Neo-Nazi Daily Stormer, covered in 2015/2016 during the US presidential election. We show through topic modeling of 21,919 articles how Breitbart established itself as a media outlet between the extreme far-right and mainstream right by both covering more extreme and more classic conservative topics. We show through time series clustering how Breitbart and Fox News converged in their coverage of Islam and immigration. Finally, we show through hyperlink analysis that the connection between the far-right and the mainstream right is mostly one-sided; while the alternative outlets link to more established ones, the established outlets mostly ignore the outlets from the far-right.","[Kaiser, Jonas; Bourassa, Nikki] Harvard Univ, Berkman Klein Ctr Internet & Soc, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Kaiser, Jonas] Alexander Humboldt Inst Internet & Soc, Berlin, Germany; [Rauchfleisch, Adrian] Natl Taiwan Univ, Grad Inst Journalism, Taipei, Taiwan",,"Kaiser, J (corresponding author), Harvard Univ, Berkman Klein Ctr Internet & Soc, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.;Kaiser, J (corresponding author), Alexander Humboldt Inst Internet & Soc, Berlin, Germany.",j.kaiser@zeppelin-university.net,"Rauchfleisch, Adrian/AAK-4164-2020","RAUCHFLEISCH, ADRIAN/0000-0003-1232-083X",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [KA 4618/1-2],Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft(German Research Foundation (DFG)),This work was supported by Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [KA 4618/1-2].,,46,18,18,3,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

Within interactions, such as debates, deliberations, and discussions, actors can set the agenda by shifting others' attention to their preferred topics. In this article, I use a topic model that locates where topic shifts occur within an interaction in order to measure the relative agenda-setting power of actors. Validation exercises show that the model accurately identifies topic shifts and infers coherent topics. Three empirical applications also validate the agenda-setting measure within different political settings: U.S. presidential debates, in-person deliberations, and online discussions. These applications show that successfully setting the agenda can shape an interaction's outcomes, demonstrating the importance of continued research on this form of agenda setting.","[Rossiter, Erin L.] Univ Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA",,"Rossiter, EL (corresponding author), Univ Notre Dame, Dept Polit Sci, 2077 Jenkins Nanov Halls, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA.",erossite@nd.edu,,,"National Science Foundation [SES-1558907, SES-1423788, SES-1938811]; Weidenbaum Center on the Economy, Government, and Public Policy at Washington University in St. Louis","National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Weidenbaum Center on the Economy, Government, and Public Policy at Washington University in St. Louis","Valuable feedback for this project was provided by Political Data Science Lab members at Washington University in St. Louis.

To measure specialization types within a consistent methodological frame, we utilize structural topic modeling. These measures capture specialization strategies used at an early career stage. We connect them to a crucial long-term outcome in academia: becoming an advisor. Event-history models reveal that specific topic choices and novel combinations exhibit a positive influence, whereas focused theses make no substantial difference. In particular, theses related to the cultural turn, methods, or race are tied to academic careers that lead to mentorship. Thematic consistency of students' publication track also has a strong positive effect on the chances of becoming an advisor.

Yet, existing theories on parliamentary debates have abstracted away from the need for information and expertise, which are costly to acquire. Drawing on the informational perspective on legislative organization, we address this problem by arguing that party leaders use committees as training arenas for their backbenchers. They task their assigned members with acquiring specific expertise and then rely heavily on those members during the corresponding debates. We turn to the Portuguese legislature, from 2000 to 2015, to discuss how saliency, government dynamics, and party size affect the use of experts. We test this theory using a novel approach to classify speeches that leverages the texts of legislation as training data for a supervised approach.","[Fernandes, Jorge M.] Univ Lisbon, Inst Social Sci, Ave Prof Anibal Bettencourt 9, Lisbon, Portugal; [Goplerud, Max] Harvard Univ, Dept Govt, 1737 Cambridge St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Won, Miguel] INESC ID, Rua Alves Redol 9, Lisbon, Portugal",,"Fernandes, JM (corresponding author), Univ Lisbon, Inst Social Sci, Ave Prof Anibal Bettencourt 9, Lisbon, Portugal.",jorge.fernandes@ics.ulisboa.pt; goplerud@g.harvard.edu; miguelwon@tecnico.ulisboa.pt,"Won, Miguel/R-1458-2017","Won, Miguel/0000-0003-0745-7452",,,,,56,2,2,0,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0362-9805,1939-9162,,LEGIS STUD QUART,Legis.

This study follows a mixed-methods approach combining topic modeling, social network analysis, and discourse analysis to analyze the discursive and network structure of an online Chinese alt-right community on Weibo. We summarize the topics Chinese alt-right influencers discuss and examine how these topics are interrelated. We find that the Chinese alt-right discourse can be deemed as both an extension and localization of the global alt-right: they frequently discuss global alt-right issues and also hold alt-right ideologies on domestic issues. Meanwhile, influencers in the community are densely connected, suggesting a high level of coordination and cooperation. We particularly identify two discursive strategies that alt-right influencers employ to reproduce the transnational alt-right discourse, namely invented common crisis of majority culture and transnational metaphor usage.

We conduct a systematic, cross-disciplinary review of 87 studies that leverage natural experimental designs to inquire into a leadership topic. We introduce the standard natural experiment, instrumental variable, and regression discontinuity design and use topic modeling to analyze which leadership topics have been investigated using natural experimental designs. Based on the review, we provide guidelines that we hope will assist scholars in discovering natural exogenous variations, selecting the most suitable form of natural experiment and by mobilizing appropriate statistical techniques and robustness checks.

The previous empirical literature has measured discretion and delegation by manually coding large bodies of legislation. Drawing from computational linguistics, we provide an automated procedure for measuring discretion and delegation in legal texts to facilitate large-scale empirical analysis. The method uses information in syntactic parse trees to identify legally relevant provisions, as well as agents and delegated actions. We undertake two applications. First, we produce a measure of bureaucratic discretion by looking at the level of legislative detail for US states and find that this measure increases after reforms giving agencies more independence. This effect is consistent with an agency cost model, where a more independent bureaucracy requires more specific instructions (less discretion) to avoid bureaucratic drift. Second, we construct measures of delegation to governors in state legislation. Consistent with previous estimates using non-text metrics, we find that executive delegation increases under unified government.","[Vannoni, Matia] Kings Coll London, London WC2B 4BG, England; [Ash, Elliott] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Morelli, Massimo] Bocconi Univ, I-20136 Milan, Italy; [Morelli, Massimo] CEPR, I-20136 Milan, Italy",,"Vannoni, M (corresponding author), Kings Coll London, London WC2B 4BG, England.",matia.vannoni@kcl.ac.uk; ashe@ethz.ch; massimo.morelli@unibocconi.it,,"Vannoni, Matia/0000-0002-8335-6402",European Research Council [694583],European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC)European Commission),This work was supported by the European Research Council Advanced Grant [694583].,,48,4,4,4,12,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1047-1987,1476-4989,,POLIT ANAL,Polit.

Most research on reelection incentives compare politicians who are term-limited with those who are not. These studies concentrate mostly on relatively senior politicians in candidate-centered electoral systems. This article leverages a quasi-natural experiment posed by the staggered implementation of the 2014 Mexican Electoral Reform, which lifted an eighty-year-old ban on reelection. The author conducts a difference-in-differences analysis of the hypothesis that reelection encourages legislators to focus more on policies with the highest electoral yield-namely, particularistic legislation. Applying a correlated topic model to a new collection of transcripts from 6,890 legislative sessions in 20 Mexican states between 2012 and 2018, this article presents compelling evidence that it does, that the effect is synchronized with the electoral cycle, and that it is larger when the legislators' political horizons are longer.","[Motolinia, Lucia] NYU, Wilf Family Dept Polit, New York, NY 10003 USA",,"Motolinia, L (corresponding author), NYU, Wilf Family Dept Polit, New York, NY 10003 USA.",lucia.motolinia@nyu.edu,,"Motolinia, Lucia/0000-0002-8160-7052",,,,,89,7,7,6,16,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0003-0554,1537-5943,,AM POLIT SCI REV,Am.

In the absence of content moderation by Western tech giants themselves, African countries appear to have shifted their focus towards state-centric approaches to regulating content. We argue that those approaches are largely informed by a regime's motivation to repress media freedom as well as institutional constraints on the executive. We use structural topic modelling on a corpus of news articles worldwide (N = 7 ' 787) mentioning hate speech and fake news in 47 African countries to estimate the salience of discussions of legal and technological approaches to content regulation. We find that, in particular, discussions of technological strategies are more salient in regimes with little respect for media freedom and fewer legislative constraints. Overall, our findings suggest that the state is the dominant actor in shaping content regulation across African countries and point to the need for a better understanding of how regime-specific characteristics shape regulatory decisions.","[Garbe, Lisa] WZB Berlin Social Sci Ctr, Berlin, Germany; [Garbe, Lisa] Univ St Gallen, Inst Polit Sci, St Gallen, Switzerland; [Selvik, Lisa-Marie; Lemaire, Pauline] Univ Bergen, Dept Comparat Polit, Bergen, Norway; [Lemaire, Pauline] Chr Michelsen Inst, Bergen, Norway",,"Garbe, L (corresponding author), WZB Berlin Social Sci Ctr, Berlin, Germany.;Garbe, L (corresponding author), Univ St Gallen, Inst Polit Sci, St Gallen, Switzerland.",lisa.garbe@wzb.eu,,"Lemaire, Pauline/0000-0002-1785-151X; Selvik, Lisa-Marie Maseidvag/0000-0003-3442-2765","Norwegian Research Council [288489, 262862]",Norwegian Research Council(Research Council of NorwayEuropean Commission),"This work was supported by the Norwegian Research Council [Grant numbers 288489, 262862].",,79,1,1,1,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

Research shows that the salience of immigration shapes voters' political behavior, but little is known about whether it influences judicial behavior. This article theorizes that variation in issue salience influences judges' behavior when there is a clear connection between the legal and a generally salient, politicized issue. I test this argument drawing on all Swiss asylum appeal decisions reached between 2007 and 2015. I find that higher asylum salience leads judges to decide otherwise similar asylum appeals less favorably. This effect is not restricted to judges affiliated with anti-immigrant parties, unlikely to be driven by accountability pressures, and strongest for those topics known to drive anti-immigrant sentiment in the general public. Together, these findings raise concerns that issue salience threatens the consistency of judicial decisions.","[Spirig, Judith] UCL, Dept Polit Sci, 29-31 Tavistock Sq, London WC1H 9QU, England; [Spirig, Judith] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Immigrat Policy Lab, Leonhardshalde 21, CH-8090 Zurich, Switzerland",,"Spirig, J (corresponding author), UCL, Dept Polit Sci, 29-31 Tavistock Sq, London WC1H 9QU, England.;Spirig, J (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Immigrat Policy Lab, Leonhardshalde 21, CH-8090 Zurich, Switzerland.",j.spirig@ucl.ac.uk,,,,,,,58,0,0,2,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0092-5853,1540-5907,,AM J POLIT SCI,Am.

The digitization of legislative transcripts has increased the potential application of established tools for the automated analyses of emotion in text. Unlike in writing, however, expressing emotion in speech involves intonation, facial expressions, and body lan- guage. Drawing on a new dataset of annotated texts and videos from the Canadian House of Commons, this paper does three things. First, we examine whether transcripts capture the emotional content of speeches. We find that transcripts capture sentiment, but not emotional arousal. Second, we compare strategies for the automated analysis of sentiment in text. We find that leading approaches performed reasonably well, but sentiment dictionaries generated using word embeddings surpassed these other approaches. Finally, we test the robustness of the approach based on word embeddings. Although the methodology is reasonably robust to alternative specifications, we find that dictionaries created using word embeddings are sensitive to the choice of seed words and to training corpus size. We conclude by discussing the implications for analyses of political speech.","[Cochrane, Christopher; Rheault, Ludovic; Whyte, Tanya; Wong, Michael W-C; Borwein, Sophie] Univ Toronto, Dept Polit Sci, Sidney Smith Hall,100 St George St, Toronto, ON M5S 3G3, Canada; [Godbout, Jean-Francois] Univ Montreal, Dept Polit Sci, Montreal, PQ, Canada",,"Cochrane, C (corresponding author), Univ Toronto, Dept Polit Sci, Sidney Smith Hall,100 St George St, Toronto, ON M5S 3G3, Canada.",christopher.cochrane@utoronto.ca,,"Rheault, Ludovic/0000-0002-9599-0427",Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada,Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),This research was funded by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada.,,91,0,0,10,20,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1058-4609,1091-7675,,POLIT COMMUN,Polit.

Although macroeconomic stance is of paramount importance for contemporary governments, our understanding of its popular politics is limited. We argue that popular attitudes regarding austerity are influenced by media (and wider elite) framing. Information necessary to form preferences on the deficit is not provided neutrally, and its provision shapes how voters understand their interests. A wide range of evidence from Britain between 2010 and 2015 supports this claim. In the British Election Study, deficit attitudes vary systematically with the source of news consumption, even controlling for party identification. A structural topic model of two major newspapers' reporting shows that content varies systematically with respect to coverage of public borrowing-in ways that intuitively accord with the attitudes of their readership. Finally, a survey experiment suggests causation from media to attitudes: deficit preferences change based on the presentation of deficit information.","[Barnes, Lucy] UCL, Sch Publ Policy, Dept Polit Sci, Comparat Polit, London, England; [Hicks, Timothy] UCL, Sch Publ Policy, Dept Polit Sci, Publ Policy, London, England",,"Barnes, L (corresponding author), UCL, Sch Publ Policy, Dept Polit Sci, Comparat Polit, London, England.",l.barnes@ucl.ac.uk; t.hicks@ucl.ac.uk,,"Barnes, Lucy/0000-0002-6403-6657; Hicks, Timothy/0000-0001-6012-8418",,,,,56,31,31,2,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0092-5853,1540-5907,,AM J POLIT SCI,Am.

Most studies of policy diffusion-which is the process by which policymaking in one government affects policymaking in other governments-have focused on policy adoptions. We shift the focus to an important but neglected aspect of this process: the issue-definition stage. We use topic models to estimate how policies are framed during this stage and how these frames are predicted by prior policy adoptions. Focusing on smoking restriction in U.S. states, our analysis draws upon an original data set of over 52,000 paragraphs from newspapers covering 49 states between 1996 and 2013. We find that frames regarding the policy's concrete implications are predicted by prior adoptions in other states, whereas frames regarding its normative justifications are not.

Critical discourse analysis of different phases of the discourse then identifies the causal factors and contingent conditions that produced the new policy. The study advances an understanding of technologies as social constructs and technological change as a social process, shaped by the dynamic interaction of a complex array of social actors coming together at critical junctures. It also draws attention to how discourse, produced by social actors in contingent conditions, recursively shapes the dominant ideology and structures these interactions.

A Model for Group Deliberation on Value-Laden Topics,COMMUNICATION METHODS AND MEASURES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,NETWORK STRUCTURE; EXPLORATION,"Agent-based models present an ideal tool for interrogating the dynamics of communication and exchange. Such models allow individual aspects of human interaction to be isolated and controlled in a way that sheds new insight into complex behavioral phenomena. This approach is particularly valuable in settings beset by confounding factors and mixed empirical evidence. The political communication setting of deliberation is one such salient setting: in business, politics, and everyday life, individuals with varying opinions, experience, and information attempt to collaborate and make decisions. Empirical evidence suggests that such collaborative reasoning can lead to good decisions, yet there are numerous deliberative failures which may frequently cause groups to reach bad outcomes. Using the substantive setting of deliberation, this paper presents an agent-based model aimed at disambiguating the individual factors which influence decision-making conversations. We model this communicative process as a deliberative game of giving and asking for reasons. Agents share beliefs around possible policy initiatives and attempt to enact good policies through a process of mutual exchange and consideration. The model considers an interconnected policy landscape in which implementing or not implementing a policy mediates the value of other policies. Within this framework, the paper considers the impacts of three canonical failures of deliberation: limited cognitive capacity, group factions, and tendencies to make poor judgments when accepting or rejecting others' views. We find that cognitive capacity can significantly decrease the ability of a group to reach a good decision. However, this effect appears to be mitigated for groups of opposing factions. Indeed, polarized groups do surprisingly well at identifying optimal policy solutions, suggesting that heterogeneous agents can achieve good outcomesifthey are willing to talk and learn from each other.","[Shugars, Sarah] Northeastern Univ, Network Sci Inst, 177 Huntington Ave, Boston, MA 02115 USA",,"Shugars, S (corresponding author), Northeastern Univ, Network Sci Inst, 177 Huntington Ave, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",shugars.s@northeastern.edu,,,,,,,41,3,3,2,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1931-2458,1931-2466,,COMMUN METHODS MEAS,Commun.

But in parliamentary systems-where ideological positions estimated from roll calls may not be informative-producing valid estimates is extremely challenging. We suggest a new measurement strategy that makes innovative use of the accuracy of machine classifiers, i.e., the number of correct predictions made as a proportion of all predictions. In our case, the labels are the party identifications of the members of parliament, predicted from their speeches along with some information on debate subjects. Intuitively, when the learner is able to discriminate members in the two main Westminster parties well, we claim we are in a period of high polarization. By contrast, when the classifier has low accuracy-and makes a relatively large number of mistakes in terms of allocating members to parties based on the data-we argue parliament is in an era of low polarization. This approach is fast and substantively valid, and we demonstrate its merits with simulations, and by comparing the estimates from 7 8 years of House of Commons speeches with qualitativeand quantitative historical accounts of the same. As a headline finding, wenote that contemporary British politics is approximately as polarized as itwas in the mid-1960s-that is, in the middle of the postwar consensus. More broadly, we show that the technical performance of supervised learning algorithms can be directly informative about substantive matters in social science.","[Peterson, Andrew] Univ Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland; [Spirling, Arthur] NYU, Polit & Data Sci, New York, NY 10003 USA",,"Peterson, A (corresponding author), Univ Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland.",andrew.peterson@unige.ch; arthur.spirling@nyu.edu,,,,,,,28,23,24,0,8,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1047-1987,1476-4989,,POLIT ANAL,Polit.

Theoretically, branded content blurs the boundary between strategic messages and communicative ones. As such, it embodies an inherently manipulative essence. By examining three case studies of government-sponsored content deals in the Israeli market (2014, 2016, 2017), the article seeks to understand the implications of such blurring once government agencies adopt this practice. Based on triangulation of sources (government documents, media content and reports in the press) the study follows the formation of these deals and dissects the consequences of their implementation. Findings suggest that government-sponsored content promotes the infliction of new types of harm that differ from those customarily associated with commercial sponsorship. It impels media bodies to adopt the role of government agencies at the formation stage. Subsequently, it allows these government campaigns to establish a ubiquitous presence within media space. Most important, the deals open a path for stealth propaganda, either for personal promotion of politicians or advancement of political agendas concerning controversial topics. As such, they corrupt both media outlets and the public sector.","[Balint, Anat] San Jose State Univ, Sch Journalism & Mass Commun, San Jose, CA 95192 USA",,"Balint, A (corresponding author), San Jose State Univ, Sch Journalism & Mass Commun, San Jose, CA 95192 USA.",anatbalint@gmail.com,,,,,,,78,2,2,1,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

This article makes two main original contributions to the field of digital journalism. First, it introduces the theoretical concept of discursive propagators that addresses the often neglected information impact of state-run news agencies operating in authoritarian states and their influence on other news media. By examining this seldom studied area of news production in the region, we are able to glean some news content that has the potential of influencing Arabic news media. Second, the study examines a unique Arabic language dataset and analyzes it using topic modelling and other digital approaches that are not often employed in the analysis of Arabic news. The analysis of digital state news agency coverage is contextualized to provide more insight into this digital type of content that often sets the tone of local journalistic production about the Arab Spring and other politically sensitive issues.","[Al-Rawi, Ahmed; Iskandar, Adel] Simon Fraser Univ, Sch Commun, Fac Commun Art & Technol, Burnaby, BC, Canada",,"Al-Rawi, A (corresponding author), Simon Fraser Univ, Sch Commun, Fac Commun Art & Technol, Burnaby, BC, Canada.",aalrawi@sfu.ca,,"Al-Rawi, Ahmed/0000-0001-7336-1550",,,,,72,0,0,1,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

We use theory from the literature on culture, cognition, and framing to explain this puzzle. Consistent with recent work on positive asymmetry, we show how the FOMC generally interpreted discomforting facts in a positive light, marginalizing and normalizing anomalous information. We argue that all frames limit what can be understood, but the content of frames matters for how facts are identified and explained. We provide evidence that the Federal Reserve's primary frame for making sense of the economy was macroeconomic theory. The content of macroeconomics made it difficult for the FOMC to connect events into a narrative reflecting the links between foreclosures in the housing market, the financial instruments used to package the mortgages into securities, and the threats to the larger economy. We conclude with implications for the sociological literatures on framing and cognition and for decision-making in future crises.","[Fligstein, Neil; Brundage, Jonah Stuart] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Sociol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Schultz, Michael] Northwestern Univ, SONIC, Evanston, IL 60208 USA",,"Fligstein, N (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Sociol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",fligst@berkeley.edu,,,,,,,72,52,52,4,37,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0003-1224,1939-8271,,AM SOCIOL REV,Am.

Participants (N= 540) were randomly assigned to view messages in a 2 (language: forceful and non-forceful) x 3 (topic: exercise, fruit and vegetable consumption, and sleep) between subjects factorial design. Exposure to forceful (vs. non-forceful) language resulted in higher negative cognitions across all three measures. Moreover, all three measures of negative cognitions were negatively associated with behavioral intention. Three competing structural models were examined, each using a different measure of negative cognitions. Results demonstrated the three models performed similarly based on comparisons of model fit and variance explained. Despite similar performance among the three measures of negative cognitions, there was a slight, but consistent advantage for the Likert scale measure model in terms of fit, variance explained, and factor loadings. Validation of these three measures of negative cognitions provides communication researchers with the flexibility to choose the measure most appropriate for their needs.","[Reynolds-Tylus, Tobias] James Madison Univ, Sch Commun Studies, Harrisonburg, VA 22807 USA; [Bigsby, Elisabeth; Quick, Brian L.] Univ Illinois, Dept Commun, Urbana, IL USA; [Quick, Brian L.] Univ Illinois, Carle Illinois Coll Med, Urbana, IL USA",,"Reynolds-Tylus, T (corresponding author), James Madison Univ, Sch Commun Studies, Harrisonburg, VA 22807 USA.",reyno2tj@jmu.edu,,"Bigsby, Elisabeth/0000-0002-5808-1005",Campus Research Board at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign [RB18129],Campus Research Board at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,This work was supported by the Campus Research Board at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign under award [RB18129].,,66,9,9,0,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1931-2458,1931-2466,,COMMUN METHODS MEAS,Commun.

We use a dictionary-based method to measure emotive rhetoric, combining the Affective Norms for English Words dictionary with word-embedding techniques to create a domain-specific dictionary.

This seems to be due to the absence of flexible and cost-efficient methods that can be used to analyze documents in different domains and languages. Aiming to solve this problem, this paper proposes a semisupervised document scaling technique, called Latent Semantic Scaling (LSS), which can locate documents on various pre-defined dimensions. LSS achieves this by combining user-provided seed words and latent semantic analysis (word embedding). The article demonstrates its flexibility and efficiency in large-scale sentiment analysis of New York Times articles on the economy and Asahi Shimbun articles on politics. These examples show that LSS can produce results comparable to that of the Lexicoder Sentiment Dictionary (LSD) in both English and Japanese with only small sets of sentiment seed words. A new heuristic method that assists LSS users to choose a near-optimal number of singular values to obtain word vectors that best capture differences between documents on target dimensions is also presented.","[Watanabe, Kohei] Univ Innsbruck, Dept Polit Sci, Innsbruck, Austria",,"Watanabe, K (corresponding author), Dept Polit Sci, Room 2-44,Univ Str 15,2nd Floor, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria.",watanabe.kohei@gmail.com,,"Watanabe, Kohei/0000-0001-6519-5265",JSPS KAKENHI [JP19H01450]; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [JP19H01450],"JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Japan Society for the Promotion of Science(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science)",This study is conducted as part of a project supported by JSPS KAKENHI Grant Number JP19H01450;Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [JP19H01450];,,62,9,9,4,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1931-2458,1931-2466,,COMMUN METHODS MEAS,Commun.

We argue that the revolving-door incentivizes congressional staffers to showcase their legislative skills to the lobbying market in ways that affect policymaking in Congress. Using comprehensive data on congressional staffers, we find that employing staffers who later become lobbyists is associated with higher legislative productivity for members of Congress, especially in staffers' final terms in Congress. It also is associated with increases in a member's bill sponsorship in the areas of health and commerce, the topics most frequently addressed by clients in the lobbying industry, as well as granting more access to lobbying firms. These results provide the systematic empirical evidence of pre-exit effects of the revolving-door among congressional staff.","[Shepherd, Michael E.] Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Polit Sci, 221 Kirkland Hall, Nashville, TN 37235 USA; [You, Hye Young] NYU, Wilf Family Dept Polit, New York, NY 10003 USA",,"Shepherd, ME (corresponding author), Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Polit Sci, 221 Kirkland Hall, Nashville, TN 37235 USA.",michael.e.shepherd@vanderbilt.edu; hyou@nyu.edu,,"Shepherd, Michael/0000-0003-2390-5892",,,,,58,12,12,4,12,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0003-0554,1537-5943,,AM POLIT SCI REV,Am.

We chronicle the history of genetics, focusing particularly on post-2005 genome-wide association studies, the post-2015 big data era, and the emergence of polygenic scores. We argue that understanding polygenic scores, including their genetic correlations with each other, causation, and underlying biological architecture, is vital. We show how genetics can be introduced to understand a myriad of topics such as fertility, educational attainment, intergenerational social mobility, well-being, addiction, risky behavior, and longevity. Although models of gene-environment interaction and correlation mirror agency and structure models in sociology, genetics is yet to be fully discovered by this discipline. We conclude with a critical reflection on the lack of diversity, nonrepresentative samples, precision policy applications, ethics, and genetic determinism. We argue that sociogenomics can speak to long-standing sociological questions and that sociologists can offer innovative theoretical, measurement, and methodological innovations to genetic research.","[Mills, Melinda C.] Univ Oxford, Dept Sociol, Leverhulme Ctr Demog Sci, Oxford OX1 1JD, England; [Mills, Melinda C.] Univ Oxford Nuffield Coll, Oxford OX1 1JD, England; [Tropf, Felix C.] Ecole Natl Stat & Adm Econ, Ctr Res Econ & Stat, F-91764 Palaiseu, France",,"Mills, MC (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Dept Sociol, Leverhulme Ctr Demog Sci, Oxford OX1 1JD, England.;Mills, MC (corresponding author), Univ Oxford Nuffield Coll, Oxford OX1 1JD, England.",melinda.mills@sociology.ox.ac.uk; felix.tropf@ensae.fr,,,"European Research Council [615603, 835079]; Leverhulme Trust; Leverhulme Centre for Demographic Science; Nuffield College, University of Oxford; Laboratory of Excellence in Economics and Decision Sciences (LabEx ECODEC) under the French National Research Agency (ANR) Investissements d'Avenir [ANR-11-LABX-0047]; NCRM/ESRC SOCGEN [ES/N011856/1]; ESRC [ES/N011856/1] Funding Source: UKRI","European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC)European Commission); Leverhulme Trust(Leverhulme Trust); Leverhulme Centre for Demographic Science; Nuffield College, University of Oxford; Laboratory of Excellence in Economics and Decision Sciences (LabEx ECODEC) under the French National Research Agency (ANR) Investissements d'Avenir(French National Research Agency (ANR)); NCRM/ESRC SOCGEN; ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC))","M.C.M. is grateful for support from European Research Council grants 615603 (SOCIOGENOME, https://www.sociogenome.org) and 835079 (CHRONO); NCRM/ESRC SOCGEN (ES/N011856/1); The Leverhulme Trust; The Leverhulme Centre for Demographic Science; and Nuffield College, University of Oxford.

We propose a new 'variance-in-time' method for forecasting events using GT. By collecting multiple and overlapping samples of GT data over time, our algorithm leverages variation both in the mean and the variance of a search term in order to accommodate some idiosyncracies in the GT platform. To elucidate our approach, we use it to forecast protests in the United States. We use data from the Crowd Counting Consortium between 2017 and 2019 to build a sample of true protest events as well as a synthetic control group where no protests occurred. The model's out-of-sample forecasts predict protests with higher accuracy than extant work using structural predictors, high frequency event data, or other sources of big data such as Twitter. Our results provide new insights into work specifically on political protests, while providing a general approach to GT that should be useful to researchers of many important, if rare, phenomena.","[Timoneda, Joan C.] Purdue Univ, Dept Polit Sci, 2230 Beering Hall,100 North Univ St, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Wibbels, Erik] Duke Univ, Dept Polit Sci, 280 Gross Hall,140 Sci Dr, Durham, NC 27708 USA",,"Timoneda, JC (corresponding author), Purdue Univ, Dept Polit Sci, 2230 Beering Hall,100 North Univ St, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",timoneda@purdue.edu,,"Carreras Timoneda, Joan/0000-0001-7057-872X",,,,,53,3,3,4,4,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1047-1987,1476-4989,,POLIT ANAL,Polit.

Conjoint analysis has become a popular tool to address social desirability bias (SDB), or systematic survey misreporting on sensitive topics. However, there has been no direct evidence showing its suitability for this purpose. We propose a novel experimental design to identify conjoint analysis's ability to mitigate SDB. Specifically, we compare a standard, fully randomized conjoint design against a partially randomized design where only the sensitive attribute is varied between the two profiles in each task. We also include a control condition to remove confounding due to the increased attention to the varying attribute under the partially randomized design. We implement this empirical strategy in two studies on attitudes about environmental conservation and preferences about congressional candidates. In both studies, our estimates indicate that the fully randomized conjoint design could reduce SDB for the average marginal component effect (AMCE) of the sensitive attribute by about two-thirds of the AMCE itself. Although encouraging, we caution that our results are exploratory and exhibit some sensitivity to alternative model specifications, suggesting the need for additional confirmatory evidence based on the proposed design.","[Horiuchi, Yusaku] Dartmouth Coll, Dept Govt, Hanover, NH 03755 USA; [Markovich, Zachary; Yamamoto, Teppei] MIT, Dept Polit Sci, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",,"Markovich, Z (corresponding author), MIT, Dept Polit Sci, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",yusaku.horiuchi@dartmouth.edu; zmarko@mit.edu; teppei@mit.edu,,"Yamamoto, Teppei/0000-0002-8079-7675; Horiuchi, Yusaku/0000-0003-0295-4089",,,,,38,7,7,1,1,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1047-1987,1476-4989,,POLIT ANAL,Polit.

We analyze novel microdata from the U.S. legal industry from 2007 to 2012 and find that large law offices whose partners are more liberal hire a larger percentage of female associates, that more-liberal partners are more likely to select female associates to be members of their client teams, and that associates whose supervising partners are more liberal have greater gender parity in promotion rates. Further, we find that the ideology of male partners is significantly more influential than the ideology of female partners in affecting these differences. We find little evidence that sorting on the part of higher-quality female associates drives the results.","[Carnahan, Seth] Univ Michigan, Ross Sch Business, Strategy, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Greenwood, Brad N.] Univ Minnesota, Carlson Sch Management, Informat & Decis Sci, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA",,"Carnahan, S (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Ross Sch Business, Strategy, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",scarnaha@umich.edu; wood@umn.edu,"Greenwood, Brad/O-5989-2019","Greenwood, Brad/0000-0002-0772-7814",Strategy Research Foundation; Temple University; University of Michigan,Strategy Research Foundation; Temple University; University of Michigan(University of Michigan System),"We thank Associate Editor Chris Marquis and three anonymous reviewers whose efforts greatly improved this research.

We tested whether early cognitive ability contributed to leadership role occupancy across four decades in a sample of 17,000 working individuals from two representative British cohorts. On average a I standard deviation increase in cognitive ability predicted a 6.2 percentage point higher probability of leadership role occupancy. In Study 1, adjusted models showed that 37.3% of high cognitive ability children (+1 SD) occupied leadership positions compared to 25.4% of low cognitive ability(-1 SD) children and this gap was even more pronounced in Study 2 (27.8% vs. 15.1%). Cognitive ability showed a graded association with the number of employees supervised in both studies and educational attainment partially explained the cognitive ability-leadership association. The results suggest that early individual differences in childhood general cognitive ability may profoundly shape trajectories of leadership across working life. 2015 Published by Elsevier Inc.","[Daly, Michael; Egan, Mark; O'Reilly, Fionnuala] Univ Stirling, Behav Sci Ctr, Stirling FK9 4LA, Scotland; [Daly, Michael] Univ Coll Dublin, UCD Geary Inst, Dublin, Ireland",,"Daly, M (corresponding author), Univ Stirling, Stirling Management Sch, 3A35 Cottrell Bldg, Stirling FK9 4LA, Scotland.",michael.daly@stir.ac.uk,"Daly, Michael/AAD-7703-2019","Daly, Michael/0000-0003-1557-8326",,,,,87,16,16,0,32,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1048-9843,1873-3409,,LEADERSHIP QUART,Leadersh.

When the independent variable X and moderator M are dichotomous or continuous, the practice of testing a linearmoderation hypothesis using regression analysis by including the product of X and M in a model of dependent variable Y is widespread. However, many research designs include multicategorical independent variables or moderators, such as in an experiment with three or more versions of a stimulus where participants are randomly assigned to one of them. Researchers are less likely to receive training about how to properly test a moderation hypothesis using regression analysis in such a situation. In this tutorial, we explain how to test, visualize, and probe interactions involving a multicategorical variable using linear regression analysis. While presenting and discussing the fundamentalsfundamentals that are not software specific-we emphasize the use of the PROCESS macro for SPSS and SAS, as it greatly simplifies the computations and potential for error that exists when doing computations by hand or using spreadsheets based on formulas in existing books on this topic. We also introduce an iterative computational implementation of the Johnson-Neyman technique for finding regions of significance of the effect of a multicategorical independent variable when the moderator is continuous.","[Hayes, Andrew F.; Montoya, Amanda K.] Ohio State Univ, Dept Psychol, 1835 Neil Ave, Columbus, OH 43210 USA",,"Hayes, AF (corresponding author), Ohio State Univ, Dept Psychol, 1835 Neil Ave, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.",hayes.338@osu.edu,"Hayes, Andrew F/A-5936-2008; Montoya, Amanda Kay/AAR-4439-2021","Hayes, Andrew F/0000-0002-8329-1696; Montoya, Amanda Kay/0000-0001-9316-8184",,,,,34,173,175,13,81,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1931-2458,1931-2466,,COMMUN METHODS MEAS,Commun.

The present study aims to examine the issue from a diachronic perspective, and it is probably the first one that employed a mixed method of both a small lexicon analysis and sentiment analysis in this line of research. Specifically, a series of experiments were performed based on a corpus of 775,460 abstracts published between 1969 and 2019 in 123 scientific journals covering 12 research disciplines in life sciences. The results demonstrated a linguistic positivity bias in academic writing. More importantly, a significant upward trend of linguistic positivity bias was observed over the past 5 decades. Major communicative functions of positive and negative sentences are also analysed. Reasons for this linguistic positivity bias are explored from the perspectives of publication pressure/bias, employment of linguistic devices to promote research, and language use for political correctness purposes. Lastly, implications for authors and learners of academic writing and for researchers of sentiment analysis are also discussed.","[Wen, Ju] Chongqing Univ, Sch Foreign Languages & Cultures, Chongqing, Peoples R China; [Lei, Lei] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Foreign Languages, Shanghai, Peoples R China",,"Lei, L (corresponding author), Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Foreign Languages, Shanghai, Peoples R China.",leileicn@126.com,,"Wen, Ju/0000-0002-6778-5098; Lei, Lei/0000-0002-3366-1855",Social Science Fund of Sichuan Province [SC20WY023]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of Chongqing University [2021CDJSKZX10]; National Natural Science Foundation Project of CQ CSTC [cstc2020jcyjmsxmX0554],Social Science Fund of Sichuan Province; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of Chongqing University; National Natural Science Foundation Project of CQ CSTC(Natural Science Foundation Project of CQ CSTC),"The research is supported by the Social Science Fund of Sichuan Province (No.: SC20WY023), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of Chongqing University (NO.: 2021CDJSKZX10) and the National Natural Science Foundation Project of CQ CSTC (No.: cstc2020jcyjmsxmX0554).",,81,1,1,22,22,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0142-6001,1477-450X,,APPL LINGUIST,Appl.

While prior news diversity studies have contributed important theoretical insights, we argue here that scholarly knowledge of this concept can be significantly advanced by employing computational methods for text analysis. Using automated methods, researchers can increase both the scope of data being analyzed and the resolution of the analysis. This article presents a novel framework for analyzing news diversity consisting of two distinct stages. In the first stage, a computational text classification method is used to analyze, at a high resolution, the attention given in news texts to a broad range of political and social issues. In the second stage, the text classifications are aggregated, and the distributions of media attention to those issues (i.e., news diversity) are assessed on a large scale. After presenting the novel approach, we illustrate its usefulness for testing theoretical hypotheses about news diversity. We compare the diversity of economic coverage in three elite and three popular US newspapers (N= 252,807 articles) and find that a fine-grained analysis relaxes concerns raised in previous studies about low content diversity in the popular press.","[Amsalem, Eran] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Commun & Journalism, Jerusalem, Israel; [Fogel-Dror, Yair; Shenhav, Shaul R.] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Polit Sci, Jeruslaem, Israel; [Sheafer, Tamir] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Polit Sci & Commun & Journalism, Jerusalem, Israel",,"Amsalem, E (corresponding author), Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Commun & Journalism, Jerusalem, Israel.",eran.amsalem@mail.huji.ac.il,,"Sheafer, Tamir/0000-0002-9242-2264; Amsalem, Eran/0000-0002-3135-9775; Shenhav, Shaul/0000-0002-8820-3579",,,,,59,1,1,2,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1931-2458,1931-2466,,COMMUN METHODS MEAS,Commun.

However, only a minority of voters believe that politicians try to keep their promises, and many voters struggle to recall the fulfillment or breaking of salient campaign pledges accurately. I argue that this disparity between the public perception and empirical evidence is influenced by the information voters receive throughout the electoral cycle. I expect that the media extensively inform readers about political promises. In addition, I posit that news outlets focus more on broken than on fulfilled promises and that the focus on broken promises has increased over time. I find strong support for these expectations based on a new text corpus of over 430,000 statements on political commitments published between 1979 and 2017 in 22 newspapers during 33 electoral cycles in Australia, Canada, Ireland, and the United Kingdom. Newspapers inform voters regularly about announced, broken, and fulfilled promises. Yet, across the four countries, newspapers report at least twice as much on broken than on fulfilled promises. Moreover, this negativity bias in reports on political promises has increased substantively. The results have implications for studying campaign promises, negative information in mass media, and the linkages between voters and parties.","[Mueller, Stefan] Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Polit & Int Relat, Newman Bldg, Dublin 4, Ireland",,"Muller, S (corresponding author), Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Polit & Int Relat, Newman Bldg, Dublin 4, Ireland.",stefan.mueller@ucd.ie,,"Muller, Stefan/0000-0002-6315-4125",Irish Research Council (IRC) Government of Ireland Postgraduate Scholarship [GOIPG/2016/1278],Irish Research Council (IRC) Government of Ireland Postgraduate Scholarship,Stefan Muller received financial support from an Irish Research Council (IRC) Government of Ireland Postgraduate Scholarship [Grant no: GOIPG/2016/1278].,,81,8,8,0,8,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1058-4609,1091-7675,,POLIT COMMUN,Polit.

Despite a few studies in political science, the potential of this methodology for the analysis of political texts has yet to be fully uncovered. This paper introduces models of word embeddings augmented with political metadata and trained on large-scale parliamentary corpora from Britain, Canada, and the United States. We fit these models with indicator variables of the party affiliation of members of parliament, which we refer to as party embeddings. We illustrate how these embeddings can be used to produce scaling estimates of ideological placement and other quantities of interest for political research. To validate the methodology, we assess our results against indicators from the Comparative Manifestos Project, surveys of experts, and measures based on roll-call votes. Our findings suggest that party embeddings are successful at capturing latent concepts such as ideology, and the approach provides researchers with an integrated framework for studying political language.","[Rheault, Ludovic; Cochrane, Christopher] Univ Toronto, Dept Polit Sci, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Rheault, Ludovic] Univ Toronto, Munk Sch Global Affairs & Publ Policy, Toronto, ON, Canada",,"Rheault, L (corresponding author), Univ Toronto, Dept Polit Sci, Toronto, ON, Canada.;Rheault, L (corresponding author), Univ Toronto, Munk Sch Global Affairs & Publ Policy, Toronto, ON, Canada.",ludovic.rheault@utoronto.ca; christopher.cochrane@utoronto.ca,,"Rheault, Ludovic/0000-0002-9599-0427",,,,,64,17,18,4,19,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1047-1987,1476-4989,,POLIT ANAL,Polit.

A potential mechanism that may reverse this trend is independent fact-checking to adjudicate competing claims in news stories. We undertake a survey experiment on a sample of 1608 Australians to test the effects of fact-checking on media trust using a real-life case study known as the sports rorts affair. We construct duplicate news articles from two national media outlets (i.e. ABC.net.au , news.com.au ) containing a senior government minister's real-life false claim that public funds were not used for political advantage immediately before an election. Half of the participants are exposed to a third-party fact check, which confirms the Minister's claim is verifiably false, the other half are not. All respondents are asked to evaluate the story's and news outlets' trustworthiness. Contrary to our expectations we find a backfire effect whereby independent fact-checking decreases readers' trust in the original news story and outlet. This negative relationship is not conditional on partisanship or the media source. Our study provides a cautionary tale for those expecting third-party fact-checks to increase media trust and we outline several avenues by which fact-checkers might overcome this.","[Carson, Andrea] La Trobe Univ, Dept Polit Media & Philosophy, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Gibbons, Andrew] Univ Texas Austin, Edward A Clark Ctr Australian & New Zealand Studi, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Martin, Aaron] Univ Melbourne, Sch Social & Polit Sci, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Phillips, Justin B.] Univ Waikato, Sch Social Sci, Hamilton, New Zealand",,"Carson, A (corresponding author), La Trobe Univ, Dept Polit Media & Philosophy, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.",a.carson@latrobe.edu.au,"Carson, Andrea/AAH-2320-2019","Carson, Andrea/0000-0001-5503-3334; Gibbons, Andrew/0000-0001-7175-7770; Phillips, Justin Bonest/0000-0002-2984-4472","La Trobe University; University of Melbourne, Policy Lab, Faculty of Arts","La Trobe University; University of Melbourne, Policy Lab, Faculty of Arts","The study was funded by La Trobe University academic start-up grant and University of Melbourne, Policy Lab, Faculty of Arts.",,57,1,1,4,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

In-depth interviews with Generation Z, who heavily use Instagram, identify visual and verbal elements of politicians' Instagram posts that they consider influential on their beliefs and actions. Responses reveal several elements, including two that expand the contours of what constitutes persuasive political personalization. Successful personalization includes politicians participating in two-way conversations with followers and adopting a backstage pass aesthetic when showing what politicians do on the job and how they feel about it. Both tactics can make politicians seem credible and personally relatable, which is the foundation for effective electronic word-of-mouth communication.","[Parmelee, John H.; Perkins, Stephynie C.; Beasley, Berrin] Univ North Florida, Sch Commun, Bldg 14D,Room 2035,1 UNF Dr, Jacksonville, FL 32224 USA",,"Parmelee, JH (corresponding author), Univ North Florida, Sch Commun, Bldg 14D,Room 2035,1 UNF Dr, Jacksonville, FL 32224 USA.",jparmele@unf.edu; sperkins@unf.edu; bbeasley@unf.edu,,"Parmelee, John/0000-0003-2668-5258",,,,,54,0,0,7,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

Drawing on role congruity expectations, we study how the use of and reactions to facial, vocal, and textual communication in political debates varies by candidate gender. Relying on full-length videos of four German federal election debates (2005-2017) and a minor party debate, we use video, audio, and text data to measure candidate facial displays of emotion, vocal pitch, and speech sentiment. Consistent with our expectations, Angela Merkel expresses less anger than her male opponents, but she is just as emotive in other respects. Combining these measures of emotional expression with continuous responses recorded by live audiences, we find that voters punish Merkel for anger displays and reward her happiness and general emotional displays.","[Boussalis, Constantine] Trinity Coll Dublin, Dept Polit Sci, Dublin, Ireland; [Coan, Travis G.] Univ Exeter, Dept Polit, Exeter, Devon, England; [Coan, Travis G.] Univ Exeter, Exeter Q Step Ctr, Exeter, Devon, England; [Holman, Mirya R.] Tulane Univ, Dept Polit Sci, New Orleans, LA 70118 USA; [Muller, Stefan] Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Polit & Int Relat, Dublin, Ireland",,"Boussalis, C (corresponding author), Trinity Coll Dublin, Dept Polit Sci, Dublin, Ireland.",boussalc@tcd.ie; t.coan@exeter.ac.uk; mholman@tulane.edu; stefen.mueller@ucd.ie,"Holman, Mirya/I-6647-2016; Boussalis, Constantine/AAC-5373-2022","Holman, Mirya/0000-0001-6648-4122; Muller, Stefan/0000-0002-6315-4125; Boussalis, Constantine/0000-0002-0609-6272","Trinity College Dublin Arts and Social Sciences Benefactions Fund 2019-20; University College Dublin Ad Astra Start Up Grant; Dunbar Fund, Political Science, Tulane University","Trinity College Dublin Arts and Social Sciences Benefactions Fund 2019-20; University College Dublin Ad Astra Start Up Grant; Dunbar Fund, Political Science, Tulane University","This research was funded through generous support from the Trinity College Dublin Arts and Social Sciences Benefactions Fund 2019-20, from the University College Dublin Ad Astra Start Up Grant, and from the Dunbar Fund, Political Science, Tulane University.",,89,3,3,2,2,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0003-0554,1537-5943,,AM POLIT SCI REV,Am.

Even though previous research suggests that information about politicians in traditional and new media can provide content that makes stereotypes based on gender and party, little is known about the presence of such bias in search engines, which function as information gatekeepers in the digital age. Using quantitative text analysis and human coding techniques on a novel data set of members of the German parliament, this study examines whether search engine suggestions, i.e. search predictions, for politicians differ with respect to personal and role-oriented information based on the gender and party of the politician. It also explores whether the search engine representation of politicians changes around elections. The study further compares gender and party differences in search engine results with corresponding Wikipedia articles of the same politicians, as users are most often redirected to Wikipedia from Google. The results suggest that politicians' representation in search engines and Wikipedia are structured by a joint effect of their gender and party identity. While Google suggestions provide less personal information about female politicians belonging to a right-wing party compared to their male counterparts, this relationship is not observable for left-wing parties. Moreover, there are changes in gender biases around the election. In Wikipedia articles, politicians belonging to right-wing parties are represented with more personal information compared to politicians belonging to left ones, an effect which is even stronger for females.","[Pradel, Franziska] Univ Cologne, Cologne Ctr Comparat Polit, D-50923 Cologne, Germany",,"Pradel, F (corresponding author), Univ Cologne, Cologne Ctr Comparat Polit, D-50923 Cologne, Germany.",pradel@wiso.uni-koeln.de,,"Pradel, Franziska/0000-0003-4559-0772",Digital Society research program - Ministry of Culture and Science of the German State of North Rhine-Westphalia,Digital Society research program - Ministry of Culture and Science of the German State of North Rhine-Westphalia,"This research was supported by the Digital Society research program funded by the Ministry of Culture and Science of the German State of North Rhine-Westphalia.

What is to be done? An extended history of successful congressional action suggests that the legislative pathway is more practical than often believed. Statutory requirements also make it possible to consider a broader suite of districting objectives. This paper presents a flexible new software and a framework for evaluating the practical implications of explicit objectives. I apply this approach to the conditions last required by Congress, generating equipopulous, contiguous, and compact districts. Among these conditions, the formal definition of compactness has proven contentious. Does it matter? I contrast the representation of the political parties and of racial and ethnic minorities under plans optimized according to 18 different definitions of compactness. On these grounds, the definitions are markedly consistent. These methods may be extended to alternative districting objectives and criteria.","[Saxon, James] Univ Chicago, Harris Sch Publ Policy, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Saxon, James] Univ Chicago, Ctr Spatial Data Sci, Chicago, IL 60637 USA",,"Saxon, J (corresponding author), Univ Chicago, Harris Sch Publ Policy, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.;Saxon, J (corresponding author), Univ Chicago, Ctr Spatial Data Sci, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",jsaxon@uchicago.edu,,"Saxon, James/0000-0002-5151-4517",,,,,70,3,3,3,5,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1047-1987,1476-4989,,POLIT ANAL,Polit.

Verbal attacks specifically provide leaders with a low-cost, easy to execute tool to delegitimize critical media. In this paper we present a theoretical contribution on when leaders in unconsolidated democracies verbally attack the media. Furthermore, we propose a way to quantitatively measure such attacks. Focusing on unconsolidated democracies, we argue that verbal attacks against independent media will increase when leaders face non-institutional ouster attempts like major protests and coups due to two reasons: 1) the surprise nature of these events, and 2) their disconnect to fully democratic means of staying in power. Our analysis examines verbal attacks on independent media by former Venezuelan president Hugo Ch?vez. We code 385 airings of Ch?vez?s weekly program Al? Presidente, from May 1999 to January 2012, counting verbal attacks against independent media. Using a Box-Tiao intervention model, we find Ch?vez?s verbal attacks against independent media significantly increased during non-institutional ouster efforts, such as major protests and the 2002 coup attempt. These findings show the degree to which elected leaders will go to discredit uncomfortable media outlets in unconsolidated democracies during uncertain political events.","[Solis, Jonathan A.] Coll William & Mary, Global Res Inst, AidData Res Lab, Williamsburg, VA USA; [Sagarzazu, Inaki] Univ Houston, Hobby Sch Publ Affairs, Houston, TX 77004 USA",,"Solis, JA (corresponding author), Coll William & Mary, Williamsburg, VA 23185 USA.",jsolis@aiddata.wm.edu,,"Solis, Jonathan/0000-0002-2570-7411",,,,,80,2,2,2,8,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1058-4609,1091-7675,,POLIT COMMUN,Polit.

A significant difference among the participants' ability to comprehend 12 base forms, associated inflected forms, and associated derived forms was found across the three proficiency groups, and even among participants who demonstrated mastery of the first 4,000 or 5,000 base forms of English. The flemma, a word's base form and associated inflectional forms, was found to be an appropriate word counting unit for most participants. Results are important because corpus research findings demonstrate that in cases where the word family provides 98 per cent coverage of texts, the flemma only provides 85 per cent coverage of the same texts. Thus, considering the detrimental impact to reading comprehension from only small decreases in the percentage of known tokens within a text, the results question the inferences made in word family-based research.","[McLean, Stuart] Osaka Jogakuin Univ, Osaka, Japan; [McLean, Stuart] Kansai Univ, Grad Sch Foreign Language Educ & Res, Suita, Osaka, Japan",,"McLean, S (corresponding author), Osaka Jogakuin Univ, Osaka, Japan.;McLean, S (corresponding author), Kansai Univ, Grad Sch Foreign Language Educ & Res, Suita, Osaka, Japan.",stuart93@me.com,,,JSPS KAKENHI [JP 16K16890],"JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",This work was supported by JSPS KAKENHI (grant number JP 16K16890).,,39,29,29,1,22,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0142-6001,1477-450X,,APPL LINGUIST,Appl.

Our statistical analyses support the argument and demonstrate that district-level economic declines can lead to an increase in the salience of cultural framing of migrants, especially in districts with a higher share of foreign residents. We also find that district-level extreme-right electoral success has a significant influence on legislative immigration discourse.

While dispositions can anchor trust levels, the dominant research findings show that the sources of variation and change in trust are political, if multifaceted, in nature. We discuss new versions of standard measures, call for a renewed look at the distinction between trust in authorities and trust in the regime, review ongoing work on how and why trust matters, and recommend broadening the foci of mistrust to include antiestablishment sentiments and attacks on electoral integrity. How trust intervenes between perceptions of political processes and compliance with authoritative commands is a critical domain for additional research. We conclude with a caveat against confidence that the decline in trust can be quickly or easily reversed.","[Citrin, Jack; Stoker, Laura] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Polit Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",,"Citrin, J (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Polit Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",gojack@berkeley.edu; stoker@berkeley.edu,,,,,,,159,100,102,35,118,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1094-2939,,,ANNU REV POLIT SCI,Annu.

In contrast to previous studies, disciplinary categories are not assumed at the outset of the analysis, but rather emerge from an initial analysis of variation across all writers in the corpus. Variation is presented in the form of a visual map representing degrees of similarity and difference between individual writers. Emergent disciplinary groupings are then used as the basis for a qualitative analysis of distinctive lexical bundles. Analysis reveals four main disciplinary groupings. A primary distinction appears between hard (science/technology) and soft (humanities/social sciences) subjects, with two further groupings (life sciences and commerce) being intermediate between these two. Evidence is also found of cross-group disciplines, which draw on a variety of influences, and of particular disciplines which are internally heterogeneous. A qualitative analysis of bundles which are distinctive of ` hard' and ` soft' disciplines is presented in order to characterize the discourse functions which mark these categories.","[Durrant, Philip] St Lukes Campus,Heavitree Rd, Exeter EX1 2LU, Devon, England",,"Durrant, P (corresponding author), Univ Exeter, Language Educ, Exeter EX4 4QJ, Devon, England.",durrant.phil@gmail.com,"Durrant, Philip/AAZ-2626-2020","Durrant, Philip/0000-0002-6416-5387",,,,,31,58,58,12,104,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0142-6001,1477-450X,,APPL LINGUIST,Appl.

We compiled, mapped, and analyzed a set of 9,757 stories published over 16 months relevant to the Combating Online Infringement and Counterfeits Act (COICA), Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA), and PROTECT IP Act (PIPA). This study applies a mixed-methods approach that combines text and link analysis with human coding and informal interviews to map the evolution of the controversy over time and to analyze the mobilization, roles, and interactions of various actors. We find a vibrant, diverse, and decentralized networked public sphere that exhibited broad participation, leveraged topical expertise, and successfully reframed a debate and focused public sentiment to shape national public policy. A network of small-scale commercial tech media, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), and individuals fulfilled the fourth estate function; traditional media then amplified the work of these actors. The campaign involved substantial experimentation and rapid development of mobilization strategies. We observe an increased public awareness of an agenda originating in the networked public sphere, which emerged successfully despite substantial expenditures attempting to produce a mass media narrative that favored the legislation. Moreover, we witness what we call an attention backbone, in which more trafficked sites amplify less-visible individual voices on specific subjects. The data suggest that, at least in this case, the networked public sphere enabled a dynamic public discourse that involved both individual and organizational participants and offered substantive discussion of complex issues contributing to affirmative political action.","[Benkler, Yochai] Harvard Univ, Sch Law, Entrepreneurial Legal Studies, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Benkler, Yochai; Roberts, Hal; Faris, Robert; Solow-Niederman, Alicia] Harvard Univ, Berkman Ctr Internet & Soc, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Etling, Bruce] Harvard Univ, Berkman Ctr Internet & Soc, Internet & Democracy Project, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",,"Benkler, Y (corresponding author), Harvard Univ, Berkman Ctr Internet & Soc, 23 Everett St,2nd Floor, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",ybenkler@law.harvard.edu,,,Ford Foundation; Open Society Foundation,Ford Foundation; Open Society Foundation,We are grateful to the Ford Foundation and the Open Society Foundation for their generous support of this research and the Media Cloud platform.,,77,58,58,2,52,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1058-4609,1091-7675,,POLIT COMMUN,Polit.

The four corpora were selected to represent a variety of corpus sizes and approaches to representativeness and sampling. In particular, the study investigates the lexical overlap among the corpora in the top 3,000 words based on the average reduced frequency (ARF), which is a measure that takes into consideration both frequency and dispersion of lexical items. The results show that there exists a stable vocabulary core of 2,122 items (70.7%) among the four corpora. Moreover, these vocabulary items occur with comparable ranks in the individual wordlists. In producing the new-GSL, the core vocabulary items were combined with new items frequently occurring in the corpora representing current language use (BE06 and EnTenTen12). The final product of the study, the new-GSL, consists of 2,494 lemmas and covers between 80.1 and 81.7 per cent of the text in the source corpora.","[Brezina, Vaclav] Univ Lancaster, Dept Linguist & English Language, Lancaster LA1 4YL, England; [Gablasova, Dana] Univ Lancaster, Lancaster LA1 4YL, England",,"Brezina, V (corresponding author), Univ Lancaster, Dept Linguist & English Language, Lancaster LA1 4YL, England.",v.brezina@lancaster.ac.uk; d.gablasova@lancaster.ac.uk,,"Brezina, Vaclav/0000-0002-1613-6100; Gablasova, Dana/0000-0001-6906-3956","ESRC Centre for Corpus Approaches to Social Science, ESRC [ES/K002155/1]; ESRC [ES/K002155/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/K002155/1] Funding Source: researchfish","ESRC Centre for Corpus Approaches to Social Science, ESRC; ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC))","ESRC Centre for Corpus Approaches to Social Science, ESRC grant reference (ES/K002155/1).",,47,90,90,4,7,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0142-6001,1477-450X,,APPL LINGUIST,Appl.

We show that the language used to describe a ballot measure does indeed have the potential to affect election outcomes, including measures dealing with contentious social issues affecting individual rights. We also find, however, that exposing individuals to basic campaign information-in our case, endorsements from prominent interest groups-greatly attenuates the framing effects of ballot text.

The German words for yes and but share the same vowel at the word boundary: ja aber. Data from naturally occurring talk show that German speakers exploit this property of their language to differentiate between ja aber and jaber. The phonetic distinction co-occurs with a distinction in how actions are formatted. In ja aber turns, ja performs a separate action, often as a second pair part, providing an elicited confirming response. The action initiated by aber is typically disaffiliative and done for the first time. In contrast, jaber-fronted turns are rarely second pair parts and perform one single disaffiliative action, which is a redoing of a previously accomplished or attempted action. The frequent occurrence of jaber in the corpus suggests that the item is being used as a wordlike entity similar to a discourse marker. The findings reveal that for participants the local requirement to manage action boundaries is more relevant than linguistic word boundaries that may exist outside the interactional context. Data are in German with English translation.","[Reed, Beatrice Szczepek] Univ York, Dept Educ, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England",,"Reed, BS (corresponding author), Univ York, Dept Educ, Derwent Coll, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England.",beatrice.szczepek.reed@york.ac.uk,,"Szczepek Reed, Beatrice/0000-0002-3814-5198",,,,,44,11,11,1,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0835-1813,1532-7973,,RES LANG SOC INTERAC,Res.

Previous studies have explored the development of a 'processing advantage' for lexical bundles and investigated whether learning materials can be optimized via repetition or enhancement in order to facilitate it. However, studies have tended to consider these factors in isolation, and little is understood about how repetition and enhancement interact as learning occurs. This is the focus of the current study. Japanese learners of English read a series of short stories repeating enhanced or un-enhanced, low-frequency lexical bundles. After each reading, participants performed a phrasal judgement task (PJT) including these lexical bundles, as well as control lexical bundles not presented in the story. Responses were faster to items repeated in the stories, and there was an initial benefit from input enhancement. A post-test indicated that students retained some knowledge of the lexical bundles from both the stories, as well as from items that only appeared in the PJTs. This study shows that including high-frequency lexical bundles in such texts is beneficial to learners.","[Northbrook, Julian; Conklin, Kathy] Univ Nottingham, Sch English, Nottingham, England; [Allen, David] Ochanomizu Univ, Fac Languages & Culture, Tokyo, Japan",,"Northbrook, J (corresponding author), Univ Nottingham, Sch English, Nottingham, England.",juliannorthbrook@gmail.com,,"Northbrook, Julian/0000-0002-2958-7154",,,,,62,0,0,3,3,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0142-6001,1477-450X,,APPL LINGUIST,Appl.

Two metadiscourse dimensions, participants' interaction and discourse presentation, are identified. The more interactive registers are more prominently marked by participants' interaction, and the more informational registers by discourse presentation. Along metadiscourse dimensions, the 10 registers are lumped into 6 clusters: 'discussion broadcasts and public conversations', 'scripted speeches and unscripted speeches', 'general prose and nondiscussion broadcasts', 'press and fiction', 'casual conversations', and 'academic prose'. Metadiscourse markers of both dimensions are frequently used in registers of the first two clusters which are highly interactive and informational, while they rarely occur in registers of the next two clusters which have low interactive or informational focuses. Metadiscourse markers of participants' interaction are pervasive in the highly interactive register (casual conversations), and those of discourse presentation in the highly informational register (academic prose).","[Zhang, Man] Cent China Normal Univ, Sch Foreign Languages, Wuhan, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Man] Humboldt Univ, Fac Language Literature & Humanities, Berlin, Germany",,"Zhang, M (corresponding author), Cent China Normal Univ, Sch Foreign Languages, Wuhan, Peoples R China.",zm@ccnu.edu.cn,,,,,,,42,0,0,35,35,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0142-6001,1477-450X,,APPL LINGUIST,Appl.

I test this claim using a new dataset of cosignature patterns within public comments on proposed federal agency rules submitted by a set of such groups between 2004 and 2014. I find that these groups are significantly more likely to pursue intersectional advocacy in coalitions but that coalition work, alone, does not relate to influential intersectional advocacy. Rather, it is particular coalition characteristics, including organizational diversity and financial capacity, that predict such influence.

Despite a rich theoretical literature discussing reputation, we do not have a comparable measure across agencies, between countries, and over time. I present a new strategy to measure bureaucratic reputation from legislative speeches with word-embedding techniques. I introduce an original dataset on the reputation of 465 bureaucratic bodies over a period of 40 years, and across two countries-the U.S. and the U.K. I perform several validation tests and present an application of this method to investigate whether partisanship and agency politicization matter for reputation. I find that agencies enjoy a better reputation among the members of the party in government, with partisan differences less pronounced for independent bodies. Finally, I discuss how this measurement strategy can contribute to classical and new questions about political-administrative interactions.","[Bellodi, Luca] UCL, London, England; [Bellodi, Luca] UCL, Dept Polit Sci, London, England; [Bellodi, Luca] Bocconi Univ, DONDENA Ctr, Via Rontgen 1, I-20136 Milan, Italy",,"Bellodi, L (corresponding author), UCL, London, England.;Bellodi, L (corresponding author), UCL, Dept Polit Sci, London, England.;Bellodi, L (corresponding author), Bocconi Univ, DONDENA Ctr, Via Rontgen 1, I-20136 Milan, Italy.",luca.bellodi@unibocconi.it,,,,,,,63,0,0,5,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0092-5853,1540-5907,,AM J POLIT SCI,Am.

Does exposure to a crisis intensify rallying by fomenting nationalism, inciting hawkishness, and distracting from quotidian economic concerns? Or does exposure deepen dissatisfaction with the incumbent, thereby reducing a rallying effect? We argue the latter using evidence from a difficult test in India. A major pre-election terrorist attack boosted the nationwide popularity of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the nationalist ruling party. Yet we find that proximity to the victims' funeral processions, which served as patriotic rallies, substantially reduced BJP support where the party was incumbent. The size and breadth of our observed effects indicate that the social commemoration of the attack, rather than direct personal connections to its victims, fuelled anti-incumbent sentiment. Mobilizing collective anger after a crisis may dampen rather than augment a rally-around-the-flag effect.","[Hintson, Jamie] Stanford Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Encina Hall West,Suite 100, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Vaishnav, Milan] Carnegie Endowment Int Peace, South Asia Program, 1779 Massachusetts Ave, Washington, DC 20036 USA",,"Hintson, J (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Encina Hall West,Suite 100, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",jhintson@stanford.edu; mvaishnav@ceip.org,,,,,,,59,0,0,5,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0092-5853,1540-5907,,AM J POLIT SCI,Am.

Previous studies have explored the development of a 'processing advantage' for lexical bundles and investigated whether learning materials can be optimized via repetition or enhancement in order to facilitate it. However, studies have tended to consider these factors in isolation, and little is understood about how repetition and enhancement interact as learning occurs. This is the focus of the current study. Japanese learners of English read a series of short stories repeating enhanced or un-enhanced, low-frequency lexical bundles. After each reading, participants performed a phrasal judgement task (PJT) including these lexical bundles, as well as control lexical bundles not presented in the story. Responses were faster to items repeated in the stories, and there was an initial benefit from input enhancement. A post-test indicated that students retained some knowledge of the lexical bundles from both the stories, as well as from items that only appeared in the PJTs. This study shows that including high-frequency lexical bundles in such texts is beneficial to learners.","[Northbrook, Julian; Conklin, Kathy] Univ Nottingham, Sch English, Nottingham, England; [Allen, David] Ochanomizu Univ, Fac Languages & Culture, Tokyo, Japan",,"Northbrook, J (corresponding author), Univ Nottingham, Sch English, Nottingham, England.",juliannorthbrook@gmail.com,,"Northbrook, Julian/0000-0002-2958-7154",,,,,62,0,0,3,3,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0142-6001,1477-450X,,APPL LINGUIST,Appl.

Moving beyond two main concepts of 'interlingual' and 'intra-lingual' discrimination in applied linguistics, this article points out the concept of 'translingual discrimination', which refers to inequality based on transnational identities' specific linguistic repertoires and backgrounds that are substantiated by the national order of things. Translingual discrimination adds intensity to transnational processes, with the skilled migrants showing particular potential for exclusion regarding two factors: translingual 'name discrimination' and 'English discrimination'. 'Translingual name discrimination' is a homogenous form of 'name' policing, evident in multiple examples where the skilled transnational migrants' job applications are often largely rejected on the grounds of their 'birth name' written on their curriculum vitae. 'Translingual English discrimination' is another common form of discrimination, where the skilled transnational migrants become subject to discrimination based on their English proficiency and their overall language skills, leading to 'the paradoxes of migration'-discrepancies between the imagination and the reality-where they fall from 'hero to zero' in the host society.","[Dovchin, Sender; Dryden, Stephanie] Curtin Univ, Sch Educ, Bentley Campus, Perth, WA 6102, Australia",,"Dovchin, S (corresponding author), Curtin Univ, Sch Educ, Bentley Campus, Perth, WA 6102, Australia.",sender.dovchin@curtin.edu.au,,"Dryden, Stephanie/0000-0001-6765-7005; Dovchin, Sender/0000-0003-4327-7096",Australian Research Council [DE180100118]; Department of Home Affairs [4-AXFMHKT]; Australian Government Research Training Program (RTP) Scholarship,"Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); Department of Home Affairs; Australian Government Research Training Program (RTP) Scholarship(Australian GovernmentDepartment of Industry, Innovation and Science)","This research was supported by Australian Research Council (grant number DE180100118), the Department of Home Affairs (grant number 4-AXFMHKT) and the Australian Government Research Training Program (RTP) Scholarship.",,53,1,1,2,2,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0142-6001,1477-450X,,APPL LINGUIST,Appl.

Using a multimodal Conversation Analysis of two extended sequences of LP during mealtime conversations, this study analyzes how FLH participants deploy verbal and embodied resources to organize participation in LP. It then illustrates how these strategies dynamically orient to sociability and learning, thereby constructing a hybrid social-and-learning interactional space. As prior studies of LP and learning draw primarily from classroom dyadic conversations, this study sheds additional light on the role of LP in regulating multiparty social talk, with application to understanding the interactional organization of informal immersion-based language learning programs.","[Moody, Stephen J.] Brigham Young Univ, Asian & Near Eastern Languages, 3069 JFSB, Provo, UT 84602 USA; [Tsuchiya, Shinsuke] Brigham Young Univ, Asian & Near Eastern Languages, 3064A JFSB, Provo, UT 84602 USA",,"Moody, SJ (corresponding author), Brigham Young Univ, Asian & Near Eastern Languages, 3069 JFSB, Provo, UT 84602 USA.",sjmoody@byu.edu,,,,,,,38,0,0,2,6,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0142-6001,1477-450X,,APPL LINGUIST,Appl.

The Russian government has instrumentalized ostensibly sound legitimations - countering terrorist and extremist propaganda, combatting child pornography - to bring about a dramatic decline in internet freedom. While these policies have been widely studied, scholarship examining how the Russian government legitimates and cultivates popular support for restricting online freedoms remains scarce. This article therefore studies how restrictions of internet freedom are framed in political and media discourses. It focuses on the case of Telegram, a popular messaging application that was banned in Russia in April 2018 for its refusal to provide the FSB with access to encrypted messages in compliance with anti-terrorism legislation. It finds that media framing of the ban was more diverse than the official governmental line. While national security framing was important, the 'rule of law' frame occurred most frequently, and conspiracy framing was markedly infrequent.","[Wijermars, Marielle] Univ Helsinki, Aleksanteri Inst, Helsinki 00014, Finland",,"Wijermars, M (corresponding author), Univ Helsinki, Aleksanteri Inst, Helsinki 00014, Finland.",marielle.wijermars@helsinki.fi,,"Wijermars, Marielle/0000-0001-7735-4403",Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek [446-17-005]; Dutch Organization for Scientific Research,Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)European Commission); Dutch Organization for Scientific Research(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)),This work was supported by Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek under [grant number 446-17-005]; Dutch Organization for Scientific Research.,,48,2,2,6,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

Yet vast literatures on political communication focus almost exclusively on what words were spoken, entirely ignoring how they were delivered-auditory cues that convey emotion, signal positions, and establish reputation. We develop a model that opens this information to principled statistical inquiry: the model of audio and speech structure (MASS). Our approach models political speech as a stochastic process shaped by fixed and time-varying covariates, including the history of the conversation itself. In an application to Supreme Court oral arguments, we demonstrate how vocal tone signals crucial information-skepticism of legal arguments-that is indecipherable to text models. Results show that justices do not use questioning to strategically manipulate their peers but rather engage sincerely with the presented arguments. Our easy-to-use R package, communication, implements the model and many more tools for audio analysis.","[Knox, Dean] Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Lucas, Christopher] Washington Univ, Dept Polit Sci, St Louis, MO 14263 USA",,"Knox, D (corresponding author), Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",dcknox@upenn.edu; christopher.lucas@wustl.edu,"Knox, Dean/AGF-3054-2022",/0000-0002-1945-7938,Analytics at Wharton; Schmidt DataX Fund at Princeton University; National Science Foundation [1122374]; Microsoft Research Computational Social Science postdoctoral researcher program,Analytics at Wharton; Schmidt DataX Fund at Princeton University; National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Microsoft Research Computational Social Science postdoctoral researcher program(Microsoft),"For excellent research assistance, we thank Taylor Damann.

A sample of 2,336 uses of the expression between 1999 and 2020 were analysed using critical discourse analysis. The findings illustrate how the expression works like a 'dog whistle' by enabling users to discretely self-identify with an imagined in-group of discontent white 'Swedes', while simultaneously showing opposition to the priorities of a generalised 'establishment'. It shows how the expression is circulated in settings ranging from mainstream to far-right, and particularly, it highlights the potential role of semi-radical settings to act as gateways between mainstream and far-right ideas. Finally, the analysis shows evolving, ever more covertly hateful uses of the expression over time, illustrating the adaptability of far-right language online more generally, as a means to evade unwanted exposure by the far-right.","[Akerlund, Mathilda] Umea Univ, Sociol Dept, Northern Behav Sci Bldg,Mediagrand 14, S-90187 Umea, Sweden",,"Akerlund, M (corresponding author), Umea Univ, Sociol Dept, Northern Behav Sci Bldg,Mediagrand 14, S-90187 Umea, Sweden.",mathilda.akerlund@umu.se,,,Swedish Research Council [2016-02971],Swedish Research Council(Swedish Research CouncilEuropean Commission),This work was supported by The Swedish Research Council: [Grant Number 2016-02971].,,66,7,7,3,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

While media have long been acknowledged as important channels of anti-immigration rhetoric, the evidence of the actual impact of news consumption on attitudes to migration and support for populist parties is still inconclusive, and largely limited to pre-digital media ecologies. Combining a representative two-wave panel survey (N=819), digital tracking of real-time electronic measurement of television, radio and online media exposure, and an analysis of news content, this study explores the effect of news consumption on anti-immigration attitudes and electoral behaviour during the EP2019 election campaign in the Czech Republic. Our analysis reveals that being exposed to news about migration - particularly on websites and on commercial television stations - increases the likelihood of voting for populist parties, while exposure to public service media leads to less negative attitudes towards immigration. At the same time, being exposed to more news sources intensifies, rather than reduces, anti-immigrant attitudes. This result challenges the assumption that a more diverse news media diet could serve as an antidote to selective exposure and echo chambers, commonly linked with radicalization of political views.","[Stetka, Vaclav; Mihelj, Sabina; Toth, Fanni] Loughborough Univ, Commun & Media, Loughborough LE11 3TU, Leics, England",,"Stetka, V (corresponding author), Loughborough Univ, Commun & Media, Loughborough LE11 3TU, Leics, England.",V.Stetka@lboro.ac.uk,"Stetka, Vaclav/AAR-6858-2021; Mihelj, Sabina/AAS-7495-2021","Stetka, Vaclav/0000-0001-8381-3645; Mihelj, Sabina/0000-0002-8557-2504; Toth, Fanni/0000-0003-0572-1002",Economic and Social Research Council [ES/S01019X/1]; ESRC [ES/S01019X/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),This work was supported by the Economic and Social Research Council [ES/S01019X/1].,,53,4,4,3,24,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1058-4609,1091-7675,,POLIT COMMUN,Polit.

With the resources afforded by the Web, a brand-new way of linking up words and images, text and visual sources, has become possible, providing the study of history and memory with unexplored tracts of promising terrain. But the importance of this emerging material is not just to do with historical knowledge and methodology. Its main contribution is political: the persecutors and the victims of those years have spoken out, they have deposited their memories online, exercising a faculty that the Cultural Revolution and post-Maoist political institutions had denied them for decades. Through the bottom-up perspective that the Internet provides, the historical protagonists have been able to bear witness in potential perpetuity without needing the researcher's mediation. By speaking directly to the public, the witnesses cease to be merely pieces of the past. They are not just victims or perpetrators who condemn past deeds, but, as the actors who made and endured history, they can turn themselves from passive historical figures into active political agents.","[Tesini, Mario] Univ Parma, Dipartimento Discipline Umanist Sociali & Imprese, Parma, Italy; [Zambernardi, Lorenzo] Univ Bologna, Dipartimento Sci Polit & Sociali, Bologna, Italy",,"Zambernardi, L (corresponding author), Univ Bologna, Dipartimento Sci Polit & Sociali, Bologna, Italy.",lorenzo.zambernardi3@unibo.it,,"ZAMBERNARDI, LORENZO/0000-0003-3232-5320",,,,,69,1,1,2,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

A key objective is to show how an innovative corpus-based technique, keyword analysis, can be used as a first step towards identifying communicative styles. We view communicative style as a linguistic means by which rapport is managed amongst participants (Spencer-Oatey 2008). Our primary data include 685 forum posts, of which 273 (over 26,000 words) were by the mentors at the heart of our study. We show that the three mentors have different communicative styles: different rapport management orientations are achieved in different ways. Furthermore, we bring together multiple data sources, including participants' posts and self-reported perception data. This allows us to find evidence on if and how communicative styles impact on student engagement and perception. We discovered that rapport enhancement aligns with increased active participation, especially if a self-effacement strategy is used, and positive student perception, but that the lack of such rapport does not automatically imply negative student perception.","[Culpeper, Jonathan] Univ Lancaster, Dept Linguist & English Language, Lancaster, England; [Kan, Qian] Open Univ, Sch Languages & Appl Linguist, Milton Keynes, Bucks, England",,"Culpeper, J (corresponding author), Univ Lancaster, Dept Linguist & English Language, Lancaster, England.",j.culpeper@lancaster.ac.uk,,"Kan, Qian/0000-0001-7440-847X; Culpeper, Jonathan/0000-0001-9833-6087","UK's ESRC; Centre for Corpus Approaches to Social Science (CASS) [ES/K002155/1, ES/R008906/1]; ESRC [ES/R008906/1] Funding Source: UKRI",UK's ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Centre for Corpus Approaches to Social Science (CASS); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"The authors would like to thank the anonymous reviewers and the journal editor for their valuable comments on the earlier drafts of this article.

The proximity of security concerns in language testing with broader national immigration policy objectives suggests a complex role for language tests as gatekeeping devices. This article draws on critical discourse studies to explore this issue. Documents provided in the 2014 tender round for selecting Secure English Language Tests (acquired through a Freedom of Information request) were analysed through a discourse-historical lens (Reisigl and Wodak 2016) to map salient topics and identify discursive strategies used to construct 'secure English language testing'. Findings show that security is a prominent topic in the tender; prospective bidders are required to meet detailed security requirements and to police subcontractors, and social actors, spaces, objects, policies and procedures are routinely described in securitized terms. Implications are drawn for understanding the role of language tests within broader securitization processes.","[Harding, Luke; Brunfaut, Tineke; Unger, Johann W.] Univ Lancaster, Dept Linguist & English Language, Lancaster, England",,"Harding, L (corresponding author), Univ Lancaster, Dept Linguist & English Language, Lancaster, England.",l.harding@lancaster.ac.uk,"Unger, Johnny/AAV-6731-2020; Brunfaut, Tineke/X-2200-2019","Unger, Johnny/0000-0001-8059-9540; Brunfaut, Tineke/0000-0001-8018-8004; Harding, Luke/0000-0001-9579-6571",,,,,45,4,4,7,19,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0142-6001,1477-450X,,APPL LINGUIST,Appl.

A total of 144 Spanish learners of English were tested on their recognition and recall knowledge of four word knowledge components: the form-meaning link, derivatives, multiple meanings, and collocations. All word knowledge components were strongly intercorrelated, and implicational scaling analyses showed that there is a consistent pattern of acquisition for these components, with recognition knowledge being acquired before recall knowledge across all the different components. Structural equation modelling (SEM) revealed that all components (both recognition and recall) contribute significantly to the global vocabulary construct. However, SEM also suggested that the recognition and recall masteries of any particular word knowledge component must be seen as separate constructs. Overall, findings suggest that the distinction between recognition and recall knowledge is fundamental to the conceptualization of the development of vocabulary knowledge.","[Gonzalez-fernandez, Beatriz] Univ Sheffield, Sch English, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England; [Schmitt, Norbert] Univ Nottingham, Sch English Studies, Nottingham, England",,"Gonzalez-fernandez, B (corresponding author), Univ Sheffield, Sch English, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England.;Schmitt, N (corresponding author), Univ Nottingham, Sch English Studies, Nottingham, England.",B.Gonzalez-Fernandez@sheffield.ac.uk; Norbert.Schmitt@nottingham.ac.uk,,,,,,,56,30,30,10,37,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0142-6001,1477-450X,,APPL LINGUIST,Appl.

Elite theories of influence posit marginal groups exert little power. I propose the concept of agenda seeding to describe how activists use methods like disruption to capture the attention of media and overcome political asymmetries. Further, I hypothesize protest tactics influence how news organizations frame demands. Evaluating black-led protests between 1960 and 1972, I find nonviolent activism, particularly when met with state or vigilante repression, drove media coverage, framing, congressional speech, and public opinion on civil rights. Counties proximate to nonviolent protests saw presidential Democratic vote share increase 1.6-2.5%. Protester-initiated violence, by contrast, helped move news agendas, frames, elite discourse, and public concern toward social control. In 1968, using rainfall as an instrument, I find violent protests likely caused a 1.5-7.9% shift among whites toward Republicans and tipped the election.

In this paper, we explore one such innovation: the campaign pledge evaluation tool (CPET). Given the unique opportunities such tools represent for assessing the political sphere, as well as the unique challenges they pose for accountability and governance, we argue that studying CPETs should be a main facet of future research on politically-relevant technologies. This article circumscribes this new phenomenon in three ways. First, from a normative perspective, we bridge CPET studies to existing fields of research, specifically, pledge studies with a special concern toward conceptual and operational definitions of pledges and their fulfillment. Second, we present a scoping review to provide an exhaustive overview of the academic literature on the subject. Third, we analyze existing CPET tools regarding their origins, designs and methodologies. Finally, we discuss questions surrounding the design and development of CPETs as well as the effects of these tools on citizens attitudes and behaviors. Our main argument is that researchers should begin to look at the impacts of CPETs and that developers of these tools should design measures to weight the promises according to their significance.","[Tremblay-Antoine, Camille; Dufresne, Yannick] Univ Laval, Polit Sci, Quebec City, PQ, Canada; [Cote, Guillaume] Univ Laval, Publ Affairs, Quebec City, PQ, Canada; [Dufresne, Yannick] Univ Laval, Teaching Digital Social Sci, Quebec City, PQ, Canada; [Dufresne, Yannick] Vox Pop Labs, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Birch, Lisa] Univ Laval, Ctr Publ Policy Anal, Quebec City, PQ, Canada; [Birch, Lisa] Univ Laval, Dept Polit Sci, Quebec City, PQ, Canada; [Birch, Lisa] Champlain St Lawrence Coll, Quebec City, PQ, Canada",,"Tremblay-Antoine, C (corresponding author), Laval Univ, Charles De Koninck Bldg,1030 Ave Sci Humaines, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada.",camille.tremblay-antoine.1@ulaval.ca,,"Tremblay-Antoine, Camille/0000-0001-6964-1373",,,,,34,1,1,0,1,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1933-1681,1933-169X,,J INF TECHNOL POLITI,J.

This perceived conflict challenges a key expectation of literatures on political media and the presidency: that functional interdependence will encourage presidential administrations to tolerate more aggressive media questioning in an effort to control media messages. We examine the interactions between U.S. presidential administrations and the White House press corps through thirty-five years of press briefing transcripts to assess the underpinnings of the current shift. We evaluate key hypotheses via a sentiment analysis using the NRC Emotional Lexicon. Generally, each side tends to reinforce, or mirror, positive and negative language of the counterparty during press briefings. However, we find a significant disjunction with the Trump Administration. Trump Administration representatives use negative language at higher rates than previous administrations and respond more sensitively to changes in press tone by decreasing positive language in response to press negativity. We discuss implications for the dynamic role of the media in shaping these changes.","[Meyer-Gutbrod, Joshua; Woolley, John] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Polit Sci, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA",,"Meyer-Gutbrod, J (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Polit Sci, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.",jmeyergutbrod@ucsb.edu,,,National Science Foundation SBE Postdoctoral Research Fellowship [1808962],National Science Foundation SBE Postdoctoral Research Fellowship,For Dr. Meyer-Gutbrod: This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation SBE Postdoctoral Research Fellowship under Grant No. 1808962.,,53,2,2,2,14,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1058-4609,1091-7675,,POLIT COMMUN,Polit.

Search engines are central in information seeking during elections, and have important implications for the distribution of information and, by extension, for democratic society. Using a method involving surveys, qualitative coding, and quantitative analysis of search terms and search results, we show that the sources of information that are returned by Google for both liberal and conservative search terms are strongly correlated. We collected search terms from people with different ideological positions about Senate candidates in the 2018 midterm election from the two main parties in the U.S., in three large and politically distinct states: California, Ohio, and Texas. We then used those search terms to scrape web results and analyze them. Our analysis shows that, in terms of the differences arising from individual search term choices, Google results exhibit a mainstreaming effect that partially neutralizes differentiation of search behaviors, by providing a set of common results, even to dissimilar searches. Based on this analysis, this article offers two main contributions: first, in the development of a method for determining group-level differences based on search input bias; and second, in demonstrating how search engines respond to diverse information seeking behavior and whether that may have implications for public discourse.","[Trielli, Daniel] Northwestern Univ, Sch Commun, Media Technol & Soc Program, Evanston, IL USA; [Diakopoulos, Nicholas] Northwestern Univ, Sch Commun, Evanston, IL USA",,"Trielli, D (corresponding author), Northwestern Univ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",dtrielli@u.northwestern.edu,"Trielli, Daniel/AAA-1023-2021","Trielli, Daniel/0000-0001-6544-1083; Diakopoulos, Nicholas/0000-0001-5005-6123",National Science Foundation [IIS-1717330],National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),This work was supported by National Science Foundation [IIS-1717330].,,54,5,5,1,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

This study focuses on the textual self-representations of 50 prominent sites labelled 'fake news' following the 2016 US election campaign, with an eye to understanding their stated values and how such sites might mimic other journalistic forms. Findings from a qualitative textual analysis reveal an open commitment to ideological, activist and value-driven reporting by the sites. Outlets openly disclose their biases, attack the mainstream media and privilege truths from subjective perspectives, appealing to partisan audiences disillusioned with the mainstream press.

Despite the close relation of incivility with social and cultural norms of what is an acceptable form of discussion, studies are mostly restricted to one country. To overcome this blind spot, we conduct a cross-national experiment in three countries (the Netherlands, UK and Spain) testing whether civil and uncivil forms of mediated political conflict affect cynicism toward the EU, political participation intentions, and the support for the policies discussed. Results indicate that despite different levels of conflict in the news, and different levels of cynicism and participation in these countries, the effects of incivility are homogenous. Uncivil political conflict has negative effects on political participation intention and policy support but does not significantly affect cynicism ? in each of the three countries. We also test the role of an individual-level factor, namely Tolerance for Disagreement (TfD). Citizens with low levels of TfD are more affected by uncivil conflict, while subjects with high TfD seem to be immune against violations of social norms. We discuss these finding against the backdrop of individual and cultural influences on political communication effects and cross-cultural experimental research in more general terms.","[Otto, Lukas P.] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Sch Commun Res, Polit Commun & Journalism, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Lecheler, Sophie] Univ Vienna, Dept Commun, Polit Commun, Vienna, Austria; [Lecheler, Sophie] Univ Vienna, Polit Commun Res Grp, Vienna, Austria; [Schuck, Andreas R.

Drawing on normative theories of deliberation, we identify empirical standards for good deliberation based on one's ability both to speak and to be heard, and use natural language processing methods to generate these measures. We first show that, even in the rural Indian context, these assemblies are not mere talking shops, but rather provide opportunities for citizens to challenge their elected officials, demand transparency, and provide information about local development needs. Second, we find that women are at a disadvantage relative to men; they are less likely to speak, set the agenda, and receive a relevant response from state officials.

This article extends the literature on computational journalism by analysing two of the BBC's recent experiments in atomizing the news-an object-based approach, which seeks to make news more adaptable and scalable using media components that can be automatically and algorithmically combined in multiple ways. Findings suggest atomised news is viewed by the organisation as offering opportunities for greater efficiency and personalisation and sits within a broader turn towards structured journalism. We highlight three characteristics of atomisation-recording, recombining and reuse-to illustrate how it breaks from traditional approaches. We find journalists are writing for machines by converting unstructured information into structured data to enable automated recombination and future re-use of content. This impacts editorial control by delegating responsibility to either the algorithm or the audience, in the name of choice. We propose a research agenda that maps the field of structured journalism, contextualises it in the politics of data and technology, and further considers the implications for public service journalism.",,,,rhianne_jones@outlook.com,"Jones, Bronwyn/AAB-7547-2021","Jones, Bronwyn/0000-0003-2482-5181; Jones, Rhianne/0000-0002-8749-9953",,,,,57,10,10,2,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

Based on the analysis of a corpus of 2.2 million words from the same leading journals in four disciplines in 1965, 1985, and 2015, we document a substantial rise in citations over the period, particularly in applied linguistics and sociology. This is partly because there is now so much more research to report and that recognizing previous work is much easier as a result of electronic access and hyperlinks to sources. But citation is also increasingly required as a means of appropriately embedding research more securely in disciplinary understandings. Our results also show a fall in the use of reporting structures, a growing preference for non-integral forms, for research verbs, for the present tense, and for non-evaluative structures when reporting others' research. While patterns differ by discipline, there is a general trend towards writers suppressing human agency in knowledge-making and emphasizing the reported studies rather than those who conducted them to show how earlier research supports their own.","[Hyland, Ken] Univ East Anglia, Sch Educ & Lifelong Learning, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England; [Jiang, Feng (Kevin)] Jilin Univ, Sch Foreign Language Educ, Changchun, Jilin, Peoples R China",,"Hyland, K (corresponding author), Univ East Anglia, Sch Educ & Lifelong Learning, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England.",k.hyland@uea.ac.uk,"Hyland, Ken/ABH-8176-2020; Jiang, Kevin/AAT-5052-2021","Jiang, Kevin/0000-0001-7369-9498",,,,,39,17,17,10,66,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0142-6001,1477-450X,,APPL LINGUIST,Appl.

After arguing for the use of 'task difficulty' instead of 'task complexity', the notion of task interactional difficulty is analyzed, first by reviewing previous SLA research, then by elaborating an explicit theoretical definition. An operationalization is suggested in terms of three dimensions: number of turn exchanges, number of initiating moves, and visual access among participants. The first two parameters can be measured on native speakers' task performance, while the third may be assessed with two categorical values. To demonstrate the feasibility of this approach, these measures are applied to a corpus of native speakers of Italian performing six different oral tasks, which are then ranked according to their interactional difficulty. Implications for SLA research and task-based language teaching and assessment are discussed, as well as possible ways of extending this procedure to other types of tasks and other facets of difficulty.","[Pallotti, Gabriele] Univ Modena & Reggio Emilia, Dept Educ & Human Sci, Via Allegri 9, I-42121 Reggio Emilia, Italy",,"Pallotti, G (corresponding author), Univ Modena & Reggio Emilia, Dept Educ & Human Sci, Via Allegri 9, I-42121 Reggio Emilia, Italy.",pallotti.gabriele@unimore.it,,,,,,,59,4,4,0,17,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0142-6001,1477-450X,,APPL LINGUIST,Appl.

We argue that in contrast to other studies investigating effects of political ads, our approach is more apt to capture the natural environment in which political ads are encountered during a presidential campaign. We focus on the intense inundation of political ads voters are confronted with in swing states in the weeks leading up to the presidential election, and argue that it is unclear a priori whether we should expect advertising to affect vote intention in that critical circumstance. We empirically validate this hypothesis using a trove of data from the 2012 campaign: daily polling in media markets around the country, detailed data on all registered voters in the country, all TV advertisements by market and exact airtime, and the entire Twitter corpus. We find that neither overall increases in advertising spending nor partisan imbalances in spending expanded the candidates' electorate. In fact, total Designated Market Area (DMA)-level spending significantly moderates a negative relationship between spending advantages and advantages in vote intention, suggesting a boomerang effect of additional spending late in the campaign. In closing, we discuss the ramifications of our findings for future research, and stress the importance of research tracking advertising effects.","[Konitzer, Tobias] Stanford Univ, Commun, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Rothschild, David; Hill, Shawndra] Microsoft Res, New York, NY USA; [Wilbur, Kenneth C.] Univ Calif San Diego, Mkt, Rady Sch Management, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA",,"Konitzer, T (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, 450 Serra Mall, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",tobiask@stanford.edu,"Li, Wang/M-1612-2019",,,,,,29,5,5,0,25,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1058-4609,1091-7675,,POLIT COMMUN,Polit.

The articulation of opinion-based identities, the tendency to homophily, and the use of emotional discourses can indeed help spread verbal violence on Twitter. This paper discusses group polarization on Twitter through Mouffe's distinction of agonistic and antagonistic politics, as elaborated in the 2013 book Agonistic: Thinking the World Politically. The theory is supported by a practical example: a qualitative analysis of Islamophobic tweets sent in the aftermath of the 2016 British referendum on European Union membership, which is commonly referred to as Brexit'. Following the UK's decision to leave the EU, there was a surge of Islamophobic attacks on Twitter. My analysis reveals that anti-Islamic sentiments were articulated in terms of complex identities referring not only to religion but also to ethnicity, politics, and gender. The paper shows that these tweets are antagonistic in character because they prevent the dialogic participation of Muslims and propagate symbolic violence rather than engaging in constructive conflicts.","[Evolvi, Giulia] Ruhr Univ, Ctr Religious Studies CERES, Univ Str 90a, D-44789 Bochum, Germany",,"Evolvi, G (corresponding author), Ruhr Univ, Ctr Religious Studies CERES, Univ Str 90a, D-44789 Bochum, Germany.",giulia.evolvi@rub.de,"Evolvi, Giulia/AAM-8805-2020",,,,,,56,33,33,5,37,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

The core model relies on a flexible multinomial specification that includes most common models in political science as special cases. I show that popular extensions (e.g., dynamic smoothing, inclusion of covariates, and network models) can be easily incorporated whilst maintaining the ability to estimate a model using a Gibbs Sampler or exact EM algorithm. By showing that these models can be written and estimated using a shared framework, the paper aims to reduce the proliferation of bespoke ideal point models as well as extend the ability of applied researchers to estimate models quickly using the EM algorithm. I apply this framework to a thorny question in scaling survey responses-the treatment of nonresponse. Focusing on the American National Election Study (ANES), I suggest that a simple but principled solution is to treat questions as multinomial where nonresponse is a distinct (modeled) category. The exploratory results suggest that certain questions tend to attract many more invalid answers and that many of these questions (particularly when signaling out particular social groups for evaluation) are masking noncentrist (typically conservative) beliefs.","[Goplerud, Max] Harvard Univ, Dept Govt, 1737 Cambridge St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",,"Goplerud, M (corresponding author), Harvard Univ, Dept Govt, 1737 Cambridge St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",goplerud@g.harvard.edu,,,,,,,35,1,1,3,5,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1047-1987,1476-4989,,POLIT ANAL,Polit.

These contradictions between media and policy constructions of young people highlight the problematic frames through which young citizens are imagined and represented. In tandem, mainstream UK media and policy documents identify normative institutional forms of participation as primary arenas for youth engagement. Drawing on extended original thematic analyses of media messages and policy documents about and for young people, and on expert interviews with young activists and youth policymakers, this paper finds that (1) adults and young people who work in the fields of youth activism and policy have far more precise and critical understandings of young people's needs, contexts and diversity as citizens than media representations or policy narratives; that (2) the nuanced perspectives of young people and of these adults is frequently lost or unheard; and that (3) a diverse repertoire of productive forms of youth active citizenship - which are critical, playful and dissenting - are discouraged, excluded, delegitimised or criminalised. By building consensus amongst powerful adults, media representations and instrumental policies regarding youth thus further widen the chasm between 'accepted' notions of youth active citizenship and how young people enact citizenship in their everyday lives. Rather than retreating from difficult and contentious politics to protect adult authorities, media and policy narratives should acknowledge these as key levers for the productive and critical development of active young citizens in a strong democracy.","[Mejias, Sam; Banaji, Shakuntala] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Media & Commun, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England",,"Mejias, S (corresponding author), London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Media & Commun, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",s.mejias@lse.ac.uk,,"Mejias, Sam/0000-0003-3462-3815",Horizon 2020 Framework Programme [649538],Horizon 2020 Framework Programme,This work was supported by Horizon 2020 Framework Programme [grant number 649538].,,51,1,1,3,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

It resists generalizations and makes scholars of politics comparativist by necessity, as its language and content are imbued with the political culture of the society in which it arises. A rich body of socio-historical analyses allows us to situate populism within the global phenomenon called democracy, as its ideological core is nourished by the two main entities-the nation and the people-that have fleshed out popular sovereignty in the age of democratization. Populism consists in a transmutation of the democratic principles of the majority and the people in a way that is meant to celebrate one subset of the people as opposed to another, through a leader embodying it and an audience legitimizing it. This may make populism collide with constitutional democracy, even if its main tenets are embedded in the democratic universe of meanings and language. In this article, I illustrate the context-based character of populism and how its cyclical appearances reflect the forms of representative government. I review the main contemporary interpretations of the concept and argue that some basic agreement now exists on populism's rhetorical character and its strategy for achieving power in democratic societies. Finally, I sketch the main characteristics of populism in power and explain how it tends to transform the fundamentals of democracy: the people and the majority, elections, and representation.","[Urbinati, Nadia] Columbia Univ, Dept Polit Sci, New York, NY 10027 USA",,"Urbinati, N (corresponding author), Columbia Univ, Dept Polit Sci, New York, NY 10027 USA.",nu15@columbia.edu,,,,,,,77,70,73,5,29,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1094-2939,1545-1577,,ANNU REV POLIT SCI,Annu.

Rather, it is treated as a self-explanatory concept related to privacy. To overcome this omission, this article develops a complex understanding of anonymity in the context of democratic theory. Drawing upon the diverse literature on anonymity in political participation, it explains anonymity as a highly context-dependent identity performance expressing private sentiments in the public sphere. The contradictory character of its core elements-identity negation and identity creation-results in three sets of contradictory freedoms. Anonymity affords (a) inclusion and exclusion, (b) subversion and submission, and (c) honesty and deception.

Using highly disaggregated election data and an original survey, we estimate that Russian television substantially increased average electoral support for parties and candidates with a pro-Russian agenda in the 2014 presidential and parliamentary elections. Evidence suggests that this effect is attributable to persuasion rather than differential mobilization. The effectiveness of biased media varied in a politically consequential way: Its impact was largest on voters with strong pro-Russian priors but was less effective, and to some degree even counter-effective, in persuading those with strong pro-Western priors.

Missing from CDA, however, is triangulation incorporating experimental methodologies. In this paper, I argue that CDA in general can benefit from an experimental dimension and that cognitive linguistic approaches in particular lend themselves to extension into experimentalism. I demonstrate this by reporting a recent experiment carried out within a cognitive linguistic framework on the effects of regular transactive versus reciprocal verbs in news reports of political protests. Results of the experiment show that in the context of media discourse on political protests, the presentation of these alternative constructions, as well as differences in information sequence, affect how people apportion blame and the level of aggression they perceive in social actors. The experiment thus not only provides evidence for the ideological effects of these particular linguistic differences but more generally goes some way to justifying CDA's focus on micro-level lexico-grammatical features of texts.","[Hart, Christopher] Univ Lancaster, Dept Linguist & English Language, Lancaster, England",,"Hart, C (corresponding author), Univ Lancaster, Dept Linguist & English Language, Lancaster, England.",c.hart@lancaster.ac.uk,,"Hart, Christopher James/0000-0002-7469-7731",,,,,83,11,11,7,42,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0142-6001,1477-450X,,APPL LINGUIST,Appl.

The focus is, in particular, on how different operationalizations of what constitutes a 'different word' (type) impact on the LD measures themselves and on their ability to discriminate between CEFR levels. The results show that basic measures of LD, such as the number of different words, the TTR (Templin 1957), and the Index of Guiraud (Guiraud 1954) explain more variance in the CEFR levels than sophisticated measures, such as D (Malvern et al. 2004), HD-D (McCarthy and Jarvis 2007), and MTLD (McCarthy 2005) provided text length is kept constant across texts. A simple count of different words (defined as lemma's and not as word families) was the best predictor of CEFR levels and explained 22 per cent of the variance in overall scores on the Pearson Test of English Academic in essays written by 176 test takers.","[Treffers-Daller, Jeanine] Univ Reading, Inst Educ, Reading, Berks, England; [Parslow, Patrick; Williams, Shirley] Univ Reading, Syst Engn, Reading, Berks, England",,"Treffers-Daller, J (corresponding author), Univ Reading, Inst Educ, Reading, Berks, England.",j.c.treffers-daller@reading.ac.uk,"Treffers-Daller, Jeanine/ABD-7048-2021","Treffers-Daller, Jeanine/0000-0002-6575-6736","Language Testing, a trading division of Pearson Education Ltd.","Language Testing, a trading division of Pearson Education Ltd.","This work was funded by Language Testing, a trading division of Pearson Education Ltd.

Key to the theory are two points: (1) common-knowledge lies may be understood as flagrant violations of the norm of truth-telling; and (2) when a political system is suffering from a crisis of legitimacy (Lipset 1959) with respect to at least one political constituency, members of that constituency will be motivated to see a flagrant violator of established norms as an authentic champion of its interests. Two online vignette experiments on a simulated college election support our theory. These results demonstrate that mere partisanship is insufficient to explain sharp differences in how lying demagoguery is perceived, and that several oft-discussed factorsinformation access, culture, language, and genderare not necessary for explaining such differences. Rather, for the lying demagogue to have authentic appeal, it is sufficient that one side of a social divide regards the political system as flawed or illegitimate.","[Hahl, Oliver] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Tepper Sch Business, Business, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA; [Kim, Minjae] MIT, Sloan Sch Management, Econ Sociol Program, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Sivan, Ezra W.

Using a combined method of textual and discourse analyses, the paper argues that the new media practices of producing and consuming user-generated video are best understood as practices of cultural citizenship that contribute to social change through the production of counter-discursive political subjectivities among youth in MENA.

That being said, we do not yet have data that show whether privacy claims were used in the past to legitimate government surveillance. This paper addresses that gap by analyzing claims made over one of the U.S.'s most controversial surveillance issues: government control over encryption technologies. A review of Congressional hearings and statements on the Congressional Record (n=112) reveals that from 1993 to 1999, public debates were dominated by a market liberalization discourse in which participants supported loosening encryption controls as a way to protect privacy from criminal intrusions in market transactions. Also playing a role was a strong skepticism toward government power and a preference for markets as managers of crime prevention. Challenged by these critiques, lawmakers withdrew regulatory proposals and spent the following decade working quietly with private firms to ensure law enforcement surveillance capability. These findings show the expansion of privacy for consumers and entrepreneurs has in fact been used to achieve the contraction of privacy from law enforcement and intelligence agencies.","[Rider, Karina] Univ Washington, Dept Sociol, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Rider, Karina] Queens Univ, Sociol PhD Program, Kingston, ON, Canada",,"Rider, K (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Dept Sociol, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.;Rider, K (corresponding author), Queens Univ, Sociol PhD Program, Kingston, ON, Canada.",16kar4@queensu.ca,"Jia, Chuanchang/AAA-5513-2020; Rider, Karina/U-1479-2019",,,,,,17,5,5,4,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

This article presents a critical-cognitive approach that is an evidence-based account of whether, and to what extent, English plays a role in identity constructions and their connection to the local politics of English. This approach is analytically powerful and productive not only in capturing the varying degrees of the contribution of the English language and its role but also in unraveling the ideological dimensions of identity and the English language. Examples of Chinese-English bilingual ads that are representative of the structural features of English mixing are used for the illustrative analysis. The article concludes with a suggestion of the wider applicability of this approach to other bilingual or multilingual contexts that are currently regarded as suitable for study.","[Li, Songqing] Xian Jiaotong Liverpool Univ, Xian, Peoples R China",,"Li, SQ (corresponding author), Xian Jiaotong Liverpool Univ, Xian, Peoples R China.",Songqing.li@xjtlu.edu.cn,"Li, Songqing/I-4789-2019","Li, Songqing/0000-0002-9667-9630",,,,,79,3,3,3,53,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0142-6001,1477-450X,,APPL LINGUIST,Appl.

Target materials included picture narratives from 40 native French speakers of English from different proficiency levels. The narratives were subsequently rated by 20 native speakers with or without linguistic and pedagogical experience for comprehensibility, accentedness, and 11 linguistic variables spanning the domains of phonology, lexis, grammar, and discourse structure. Results showed that comprehensibility was associated with several linguistic variables (vowel/consonant errors, word stress, fluency, lexis, grammar), whereas accentedness was chiefly linked to pronunciation (vowel/consonant errors, word stress). Native-speaking listeners thus appear to pay particular attention to pronunciation, rather than lexis and grammar, to evaluate nativelikeness but tend to consider various sources of linguistic information in L2 speech in judging comprehensibility. The use of listener ratings (perceptual measures) in evaluating linguistic aspects of learner speech and their implications for language assessment and pedagogy are discussed.","[Saito, Kazuya] Birkbeck Univ London, Dept Appl Linguist & Commun, London, England; [Trofimovich, Pavel] Concordia Univ, Dept Educ, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Isaacs, Talia] Univ Bristol, Grad Sch Educ, Bristol, Avon, England",,"Saito, K (corresponding author), Birkbeck Univ London, Dept Appl Linguist & Commun, London, England.",k.saito@bbk.ac.uk,,"Saito, Kazuya/0000-0002-4718-2943",,,,,56,66,67,2,58,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0142-6001,1477-450X,,APPL LINGUIST,Appl.

We examine the intersection of transnational acculturation with mediated communication via mobile phones within the domains of life and work. Data from in-depth qualitative interviews (75) allowed for thick descriptions. We find that, despite encountering heterotopic practices, transnational migrant workers engage in a phenomenon we label bounded cosmopolitanism', or the ability to engage in learning, enjoy economic growth, and embrace cultural hybridity, to escape the shackles of race, class, and gender. Mobile phones play a significant role in providing open participatory spaces; yet; this phenomenon signifying openness, innovation, and acceptance is restricted to organizational workspaces.

Our findings not only provide the first systemic evidence that the language assistance provisions have a direct effect on Latino representation, but also link the efficacy of the language assistance provisions to the duration and consistency of coverage and the presence of federal elections observers.

Researchers in the field of media and politics are now focusing on the mechanisms underlying this pattern. This article contributes to the literature by focusing not on aggregate, behavioral political attention for issues (e.g., parliamentary questions or legislation), but on Members of Parliament's (MP) individual, cognitive attention for specific news stories. Drawing upon a survey of Belgian MPs administered shortly after exposure to news stories, the study shows that MPs are highly selective in exploiting media cues. They pay more attention to both prominent and useful news stories, but a story's usefulness is more important for cognitive processes that are closely linked to MPs' real behavior in parliament. In other words, aggregate political agenda-setting effects are a consequence of the way in which individual MPs process media information that matches their task-related needs.","[Sevenans, Julie; Walgrave, Stefaan; Epping, Gwendolyn Joanna] Univ Antwerp, Dept Polit Sci, Antwerp, Belgium",,"Sevenans, J (corresponding author), Univ Antwerp, Sint Jacobstr 2, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium.",julie.sevenans@uantwerpen.be,"Walgrave, Stefaan/P-6545-2016","Walgrave, Stefaan/0000-0003-1814-1015",European Research Council [295735]; Research Fund of the University of Antwerp [26827],European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC)European Commission); Research Fund of the University of Antwerp,"The authors gratefully acknowledge support of the European Research Council (Advanced Grant 'INFOPOL', No 295735) and of the Research Fund of the University of Antwerp (Grant No 26827).

These spaces are provided by news organizations as part of a mission to provide a public space for discourse, but are governed by a commenting policy that establishes the rules for discourse and behavior. These rules can help to meet the ideals of public discourse or stand in the way of productive public deliberation. This study examines the commenting policies of 21 news corporations in the United States to see how the policies facilitate or inhibit the creation of a space for ideal public discourse. A constant comparative analysis of the policies guided by the ideals of Habermas' public sphere, as well as the expectations of civility norms, shows that news organizations establish rules to protect respectful and egalitarian spaces for the public, but fail to meet other critical needs of public discourse, including rationality, tolerance, reflexivity, and the pursuit of common understanding and solutions.

This article offers a critical examination of the interaction of feminist theories and the international human rights discourses as articulated at the UN forums and documents. It contends that although a range of feminisms that elucidate the diversity of women's experiences and complexities of oppression have been incorporated into some UN documents, the overall women's rights approach of the UN is still informed by the demands and expectations of liberal feminism. This is particularly evident in the aggregate indicators that are employed to assess the empowerment of women. In addition to explaining why liberal feminism trumps other feminisms, the article addresses the problems with following policies that are informed by liberal feminism. Noting that the integrative approach of liberal feminism may establish gender equality without empowering the majority of women, it criticizes using aggregate indicators of empowerment for conflating sources of power with empowerment and making false assumptions.","[Arat, Zehra F.

The study adopts a practice-based approach, considering the ways TV audiences, politicians, and journalists used Twitter in order to participate in the discourses activated around Italian political talk shows, during the permanent' campaign for the 2013 general elections (from September 2012 to June 2013; 11 shows; 1076 episodes). We analysed these communication practices referring, at first, to the complete collection of tweets, including the official hashtags of Italian political talk shows (2,489,669 tweets). The analysis pointed out that a narrow audience had access to these practices, and that the potential for media and politicians to interact with audiences/citizens and to manage their interpretive engagement' in the construction of agendas has not been actualized. Furthermore, focusing on a sample of tweets produced around the three main parties (15,737) and the relative TV scene (23), the analysis showed that connected audiences were engaged especially in two forms of participation through' Twitter during talk shows (opinions/comments and requests for interaction with the TV hosts and guests). The article suggests a newer way to work on big data in order to gather a first-hand narrative of participation, left online by networked publics, without forgetting the contribution older techniques could make to the understanding of hybrid practices of political communication and participation.","[Iannelli, Laura] Univ Sassari, Dept Polit Sci Commun Sci & Informat Engn, I-07100 Sassari, Italy; [Giglietto, Fabio] Univ Urbino, Dept Commun Studies & Humanities, I-61029 Urbino, Italy",,"Iannelli, L (corresponding author), Univ Sassari, Dept Polit Sci Commun Sci & Informat Engn, Univ Sq 11, I-07100 Sassari, Italy.",liannelli@uniss.it,"Giglietto, Fabio/A-3940-2012","Giglietto, Fabio/0000-0001-8019-1035; Iannelli, Laura/0000-0002-1679-0647",,,,,47,11,11,0,58,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

We then apply this method to study citizens' ideological preferences and perceptions using data from the 2004-2012 American National Election Studies and the 2010 Cooperative Congressional Election Study.

We document the scope and consequences of affective polarization of partisans using implicit, explicit, and behavioral indicators. Our evidence demonstrates that hostile feelings for the opposing party are ingrained or automatic in voters' minds, and that affective polarization based on party is just as strong as polarization based on race. We further show that party cues exert powerful effects on nonpolitical judgments and behaviors. Partisans discriminate against opposing partisans, doing so to a degree that exceeds discrimination based on race. We note that the willingness of partisans to display open animus for opposing partisans can be attributed to the absence of norms governing the expression of negative sentiment and that increased partisan affect provides an incentive for elites to engage in confrontation rather than cooperation.","[Iyengar, Shanto] Stanford Univ, Commun, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Iyengar, Shanto] Stanford Univ, Polit Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Westwood, Sean J.] Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA",,"Iyengar, S (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Commun, Bldg 120,Room 110,450 Serra Mall, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",siyengar@stanford.edu; seanjwestwood@gmail.com,,"iyengar, shanto/0000-0003-2406-719X",,,,,68,703,706,18,172,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0092-5853,1540-5907,,AM J POLIT SCI,Am.

This dimension of classroom discourse, however, has not been studied systematically. Taking a corpus-based approach, this study investigates the non-informational dimension of classroom discourse, focusing on the marking of emotions, affect, and the speaker's 'involvement' (Chafe 1982) in the talk of university professors, in a large corpus of American university classroom discourse. It tracks the use of involvement markers across class sessions representing three situational factors that define the university setting: academic discipline, level of instruction, and class size. Surprisingly, these factors have relatively little influence on involvement in language, suggesting that involvement is pervasive in American classroom talk. However, involvement tends to be more common in small courses in the Humanities and Social Sciences, at the upper division and graduate level-courses that generally favor student participation, hence interactivity in discourse. Analyses of the relationship between involvement and interactivity reveal that while interactivity tends to predict involvement, involvement is not limited to interactive discourse.","Swansea Univ, Dept English Language & Literature, Swansea SA2 8PP, W Glam, Wales",,"Barbieri, F (corresponding author), Swansea Univ, Dept English Language & Literature, Swansea SA2 8PP, W Glam, Wales.",f.barbieri@swansea.ac.uk,,"Barbieri, Federica/0000-0001-9088-7730",,,,,58,8,7,3,41,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0142-6001,1477-450X,,APPL LINGUIST,Appl.

We systematically analyze White House, military, congressional, and news communications and draw upon scholarship in social psychology to assess why the press might challenge certain frames in response to My Lai but indiscriminately echo others. In particular, within these communications, we examine how serious and widespread the actions at My Lai were conveyed to be, how the circumstances were portrayed, how the actors involved in the incident were characterized, and the extent to which America's core values were questioned. Our findings suggest that the Nixon administration employed frames designed to downplay the severity of the My Lai incident, highlight extenuating circumstances faced by those directly involved, denigrate the alleged low-level perpetrators, and bolster the national identity. These frames were then largely echoed in the press, despite consistent and forceful challenges by congressional Democrats. These findings, we argue, align with the cascading activation model, and we build on it by highlighting the underlying importance of cultural resonance in the framing process. We reflect on the theoretical and practical implications of these patterns and, in doing so, engage the broader scholarly debate over the process through which U.S. news coverage aligns with the communications of government officials, particularly in moments of national dissonance.","[Rowling, Charles M.] Univ Nebraska Kearney, Dept Polit Sci, Kearney, NE 68849 USA; [Sheets, Penelope] Univ Amsterdam, Sch Commun Res, NL-1012 WX Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Jones, Timothy M.] Bellevue Coll, Dept Polit Sci, Bellevue, WA 98007 USA",,"Rowling, CM (corresponding author), Univ Nebraska Kearney, Dept Polit Sci, Founders Hall 2240, Kearney, NE 68849 USA.",rowlingcm@unk.edu,,,,,,,53,7,7,1,10,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1058-4609,1091-7675,,POLIT COMMUN,Polit.

To better explain how leaders acquire information, I develop and test an informational theory of bureaucracies during crises. Time-constrained leaders delegate information collection to advisers who lead bureaucracies. A division of labor between bureaucracies breeds comparative specialization among advisers. Some emphasize information on adversaries' political attributes, which are harder to assess; others stress military attributes, which are easier to assess. Bureaucratic role thus affects the content and uncertainty that advisers provide. I use automated and qualitative coding to measure adviser input in 5,400 texts from US Cold War crises. As hypothesized, advisers' positions affect the information and uncertainty they convey but not the policies they promote as canonical theories suggest. For individuals advising leaders during crises, what you know depends on where you sit. Consequently, the information leaders possess hinges on which bureaucracies have their attention.","[Schub, Robert] Univ Nebraska, Dept Polit Sci, Lincoln, NE 68583 USA",,"Schub, R (corresponding author), Univ Nebraska, Dept Polit Sci, Lincoln, NE 68583 USA.",robert.schub@unl.edu,,"Schub, Robert/0000-0003-3315-4957",,,,,78,0,0,1,1,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0003-0554,1537-5943,,AM POLIT SCI REV,Am.

According to this principle, sovereignty depends on more than supra-national alliances or international legal instruments, military might or trade: it depends on locally owned, controlled and operated innovation ecosystems, able to increase states' technical and economic independence and autonomy. Presently, digital sovereignty is understood primarily as a legal concept and a set of political discourses. As a consequence, it is predominantly analyzed by political science, international relations and international law. However, the study of digital sovereignty as a set of infrastructures and socio-material practices has been comparatively neglected. This article explores how the concept of digital sovereignty can be studied via the infrastructure-embedded 'situated practices' of various political and economic projects which aim to establish autonomous digital infrastructures in a hyperconnected world.

While news media cannot deliver policy on their own, they are fully equipped to represent, interpret, and amplify grievance. If disaffection is directed at retribution rather than policy, journalism contributes to backsliding in the further pathologizing of (non)-responsive government. This essay proposes critical realism (CR) as a heuristic for conceptualizing unique contributions of news media to backsliding. Reality consists of layered strata in CR. This approach accepts the premise of news as a social construction but maintains that a domain of reality exists independent of discursive representation, and that this realm can be actualized in ways that are damaging to democracy. Applied to political communication, the domain of the real includes democratic deficits that may or may not become actualized depending on how journalism operates at the empirical level. Critical realism also generates insights applicable to reform. CR insists that journalists avoid reifying sentiment in ways that comfort authoritarians. The diagnostic acknowledges the journalistic conviction that an external reality is knowable, positing nevertheless that the news interacts with underlying social forces. The profession must forge a healthier relationship with the public to avoid reifying audience support for anti-democratic norms. Reflexivity could be directed beyond the recognition of complicity to two productive rationales for safeguarding democracy: liberal multiculturalism and journalistic paternalism. A final section offers a framework for future research in tracing linkages between journalistic practice and backsliding.","[McDevitt, Michael] Univ Colorado, Polit Commun, Boulder, CO 80309 USA",,"McDevitt, M (corresponding author), Univ Colorado, Polit Commun, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",mike.mcdevitt@colorado.edu,,,,,,,77,0,0,5,5,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1058-4609,1091-7675,,POLIT COMMUN,Polit.

To date, theories of judicial decision making are rooted in ranked societies with majority-minority group cleavages, leaving unanswered which groups are more prone to express bias and whether it is motivated by in-group favoritism or out-group hostility. We examine judicial bias in Kenya, a diverse society that features a more complex ethnic landscape. While research in comparative and African politics emphasizes instrumental motivations underpinning ethnic identity, we examine the psychological, implicit biases driving judicial outcomes. Using data from Kenyan criminal appeals and the conditional random assignment of judges to cases, we show that judges are 3 to 5 percentage points more likely to grant coethnic appeals than non-coethnic appeals. To understand mechanisms, we use word embeddings to analyze the sentiment of written judgments. Judges use more trust-related terms writing for coethnics, suggesting that in-group favoritism motivates coethnic bias in this context.","[Choi, Donghyun Danny] Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Polit Sci, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA; [Harris, J.

To this end, it brings bidialectal practices to the forefront to investigate L2 Arabic pragmatic development in a short-term study abroad programme. In particular, bidialectal practices, or the ability to use one or more spoken varieties alongside Modern Standard Arabic, are explored in this study in relation to appropriateness and pragmatic strategies in the production of apologies, refusals, and requests. A spoken discourse completion task that included scenarios with varied power and social distance combinations were utilized to collect data from 36 participants (21 L2 Arabic learners and 15 L1 Arabic speakers) in an eight-week study abroad sojourn. Findings indicated an overall improvement of pragmatic competence over the period of eight weeks. Specifically, significant developments were demonstrated in appropriateness scores and learners' use of bidialectal practices in pragmatic strategies. Moreover, the qualitative analysis of strategies development identified areas in which learners converged towards or diverged from L1 speaker norms. Methodologically, the study shows that utilizing bidialectal practices to measure L2 Arabic pragmatic competence development is key to understanding learners' developmental trajectories.","[Al Masaeed, Khaled] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Dept Modern Languages, 341 Posner Hall,5000 Forbes Ave, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA",,"Al Masaeed, k (corresponding author), Carnegie Mellon Univ, Dept Modern Languages, 341 Posner Hall,5000 Forbes Ave, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA.",masaeed@andrew.cmu.edu,,", Khaled/0000-0003-2365-1327",,,,,64,0,0,0,0,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0142-6001,1477-450X,,APPL LINGUIST,Appl.

The article uses data from the South African educational context to advance a position in which semiotic repertoires simultaneously give and restrict access, evoke evaluation and construct identities in particular ways because of their entanglement with (racialized) bodies. I propose that this simultaneity can be theorized by viewing the black body as 'intercorporeal' and 'grotesque' (Bakhtin 1984). By drawing on such an approach, processes of racialization are explicitly connected to how semiotic resources are evoked in discourse. This article thus theoretically contributes to the recent movements in applied linguistics that view language as embodied, re-examine repertoires, and view language as multiplex and entangled. In addition, it also offers a framing that can theoretically challenge discourses of post-racialism with its multilayered account of how race continues to be experienced as a significant form of meaning-making.","[OOSTENDORP, M.

To do so, we conduct a rigorous qualitative analysis of discourse during a two-week period in which the Florida legislature considered and passed the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School Public Safety Act after a shooter killed 17 people in Parkland, Florida. We systematically explore how two framing dynamics - competition and amplification - shape what frames political actors champion and the relative effects of these dynamics on individual claimsmaking in 438 letters to the editor and op-eds appearing in mainstream outlets, 4,962 emails sent to Florida Governor Rick Scott, and 1,000 tweets. We find that amplification and competition shape the relative visibility of frames and the frequency with which individuals use these frames in their claimsmaking. Generally speaking, gun control and progressive groups selectively amplified frames associated with the emerging, student-led Never Again Marjory Stoneman Douglas movement and legislative frames that were consistent with their goals. This seems to have increased the visibility of these ideas in mainstream outlets and influenced claimsmaking insofar as individuals drew on amplified frames across the forums relatively frequently. This was not true of frames opposing gun control. Gun rights groups bickered with politicians and among themselves. As a result, gun rights frames were less prevalent in mainstream discourse and in individual claimsmaking.","[Rohlinger, Deana A.; DeLucchi, Caitria] Florida State Univ, Dept Sociol, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA; [Allen, Warren] Rutgers State Univ, Sch Commun & Informat, New Brunswick, NJ USA",,"Rohlinger, DA (corresponding author), Florida State Univ, Dept Sociol, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA.",deana.rohlinger@fsu.edu,,,,,,,34,0,0,4,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

This article investigates how political elites undertaking projects of political articulation-understood as linking together diverse constituencies to create integrated political blocs-contend with preexisting cultural constraints embedded in the social fabric. I do so by tracing how the post-1959 Cuban regime attempted to build a population-wide revolutionary identity despite persisting cultural understandings of women primarily as apolitical housewives. Through systematic analysis of a large corpus of state discourse in the form of speeches and women's magazines, I show how regime leaders negotiated, with varying degrees of success over time, the cultural constraints that gender posed to their unifying project. Ultimately, the regime's initiatives to politicize women through including them in mass campaigns and radicalizing their traditional household tasks were relatively successful, but cultural backlash against women's increasing presence in the labor force prompted the institutionalization of a gendered division of labor in the economy that traditionalized their initially radical entry into the workplace. Analyzing how political elites confront and manage social differences within political blocs promises to contribute to a better understanding of the political production of social solidarity and its downstream effects on categorical inequalities.","[Triplett, Jen] Univ Michign, Dept Sociol, Room 3115 LSA Bldg,500 S State St, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",,"Triplett, J (corresponding author), Univ Michign, Dept Sociol, Room 3115 LSA Bldg,500 S State St, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",jentrip@umich.edu,,,University of Michigan's Rackham Student Research Grant,University of Michigan's Rackham Student Research Grant,This project was supported by the University of Michigan's Rackham Student Research Grant.,,91,0,0,2,2,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0003-1224,1939-8271,,AM SOCIOL REV,Am.

Yet, the validity of machine-coded event data remains disputed, especially in the context of event geolocation. We analyze the frequencies of human- and machine-geocoded event data agreement in relation to an independent (ground truth) source. The events are human rights violations in Colombia. We perform our evaluation for a key, 8-year period of the Colombian conflict and in three 2-year subperiods as well as for a selected set of (non)journalistically remote municipalities. As a complement to this analysis, we estimate spatial probit models based on the three datasets. These models assume Gaussian Markov Random Field error processes; they are constructed using a stochastic partial differential equation and estimated with integrated nested Laplacian approximation. The estimated models tell us whether the three datasets produce comparable predictions, underreport events in relation to the same covariates, and have similar patterns of prediction error. Together the two analyses show that, for this subnational conflict, the machine- and human-geocoded datasets are comparable in terms of external validity but, according to the geostatistical models, produce prediction errors that differ in important respects.","[Stundal, Logan; Holmes, Jennifer S.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Polit Sci, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Bagozzi, Benjamin E.] Univ Delaware, Dept Polit Sci & IR, Newark, DE USA; [Freeman, John R.] UT Dallas, Sch Econ Polit & Policy Sci, Richardson, TX USA",,"Stundal, L (corresponding author), Univ Minnesota, Dept Polit Sci, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.",stund005@umn.edu; bagozzib@udel.edu; freeman@umn.edu; jholmes@utdallas.edu,,"Stundal, Logan/0000-0003-0444-4154; Bagozzi, Benjamin/0000-0002-6233-6453",National Science Foundation [SBE-SMA-1539302],National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),This work was supported by the National Science Foundation [SBE-SMA-1539302].,,42,0,0,2,2,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1047-1987,1476-4989,,POLIT ANAL,Polit.

What accounts for the variation in news coverage received by different foreign countries? While existing literature points to political concerns at home, in this article, we argue that a regime's economic interests can also be a driving force: the desire to deepen its international economic engagement can motivate the regime to treat foreign countries differently in its news coverage. To test this argument, we examine foreign news coverage by China's state-run television network between 2003 and 2018. Combining textual and quantitative analysis, we find that countries with stronger economic ties with China receive more favorable news coverage. Moreover, the manipulation of coverage favorability is achieved through selective reporting: negative events such as armed conflicts receive less coverage when taking place in a country with close economic ties with China. These findings contribute to our understanding of international news flow, especially in a non-Western setting. They also demonstrate a pragmatic rather than political use of information control by an authoritarian government.","[Ji, Chengyuan] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Int & Publ Affairs, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Liu, Hanzhang] Pitzer Coll, Dept Polit Studies, Claremont, CA 91711 USA",,"Liu, HZ (corresponding author), Pitzer Coll, Dept Polit Studies, Claremont, CA 91711 USA.",hanzhang_liu@pitzer.edu,,"Ji, Chengyuan/0000-0001-8892-3982; Liu, Hanzhang/0000-0003-1003-1372",,,,,47,0,0,18,22,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1058-4609,1091-7675,,POLIT COMMUN,Polit.

However, out-group animosity may operate differently depending on the party or elite. We investigate the extent to which citizens' animus toward (Democratically aligned) minority groups drove political support for Donald Trump, whose incendiary rhetoric regarding such groups is unique in modern presidential politics. Leveraging panel data beginning before Trump's candidacy, we find that animus toward Democratic-linked groups in 2011 predicts future support for Trump regardless of party identity. This animus does not predict future support for other Republican or Democratic politicians or either party. Nor do we find that animus toward Republican groups predicts support for Democratic elites. Trump's support is thus uniquely tied to animus toward minority groups. Our findings provide insights into the social divisions underlying American politics and the role of elite rhetoric in translating animus into political support.","[Mason, Lilliana] Johns Hopkins Univ, SNF Agora Inst, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA; [Mason, Lilliana] Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA; [Wronski, Julie] Univ Mississippi, Dept Polit Sci, University, MS 38677 USA; [Kane, John, V] NYU, Ctr Global Affairs, New York, NY 10003 USA",,"Mason, L (corresponding author), Johns Hopkins Univ, SNF Agora Inst, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA.;Mason, L (corresponding author), Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA.",lmason23@jhu.edu; jwronski@olemiss.edu; jvk221@nyu.edu,"Mason, Lilliana/J-8847-2015","Mason, Lilliana/0000-0002-0305-8246",,,,,15,9,9,1,1,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0003-0554,1537-5943,,AM POLIT SCI REV,Am.

While research tends to focus on individual factors for potential petitioners that influence signing, less attention has been paid to the influence of the actual text of petitions. This paper uses data from an original web-based survey experiment in Australia and Germany to test the influence of content factors: narratives (i.e., stories based on individual experiences and emotions) and popularity cues (i.e., high numbers of signatures) across two issues: climate change and welfare policy.

Reading a variety of textual sources ranging from trade publications to industry press outlets to popular autobiographies, we will argue that the company is engaged in a hybrid form of media imperialism and platform imperialism through a variety of industrial practices: vertical integration built around a proprietary platform, transnational scaling up of production at a rapid pace, and engaging in corporate practices that systematically disregard accountability and legal regulation. The article ends with examining how national governments and inter-imperialist rivalries might complicate Netflix's ambitions.","[Davis, Stuart] Baruch Coll, New York, NY USA",,"Davis, S (corresponding author), 318 43 St, Brooklyn, NY 11232 USA.",Stuart.davis@baruch.cuny.edu,,,,,,,66,0,0,4,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

Within this context, issues connected with religious diversity have received little attention. But valuable insights can be gained from examining how radical religious advocates embrace digital strategies, using their own marginality to ironically oppose religious diversity. This article discusses the discursive strategies of the Polish far-right, their approach to religious diversity, and their iteration practices. It focuses on the discursive strategies and practices of far-right leaders of opinion in Poland opposed to religious diversity that have worked to narrow Christian values to a reinvented idea of traditional Catholicism. In this, they use techniques of language and narrative control, with intentional repetition playing a key role. My research suggests the need for an intricate understanding of these processes, in which Poland's far-right movements shape identities through shifting religious norms in often hidden practices of religious exclusion.","[Guzek, Damian] Univ Silesia Katowice, Inst Journalism & Media Commun, Bakowa 11, PL-40007 Katowice, Poland",,"Guzek, D (corresponding author), Univ Silesia Katowice, Inst Journalism & Media Commun, Bakowa 11, PL-40007 Katowice, Poland.",damian.guzek@us.edu.pl,,"Guzek, Damian/0000-0002-8138-8128",,,,,70,0,0,5,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

Focusing on the historical production of persons, I analyze interactional recordings, instructional artifacts, and participant interviews collected over three years of qualitative inquiry. The analysis articulates how Tom's narrative of intercultural encounters was reframed, rekeyed, and recycled at home and abroad. Along the way, Tom was identified as (i) an avid learner of Chinese in a language classroom in the USA; (ii) an ignorant foreigner while studying in China; and (iii) a political outcast upon his return to the USA whose intercultural experience abroad, nevertheless, afforded his classmates an opportunity to appreciate a more ethno-relative perspective. The consonance and dissonance of identification are results of interplay between history in person and history in institutionalized struggles. This interplay must be considered to understand the (re)making of language-learning identities across historical time, social space, and communicative modes.

Unlike existing methods, the proposed Bipartite Link Community Model (biLCM) (1) applies to two groups of actors, (2) takes into account that actors may be members of more than one community, and (3) allows a pair of actors to interact in more than one way. We apply this method to characterize legislative communities of special interest groups and politicians in the 113th U.S. Congress. Previous empirical studies of interest group politics have been limited by the difficulty of observing the ties between interest groups and politicians directly. We therefore first construct an original dataset that connects the politicians who sponsor congressional bills with the interest groups that lobby on those bills based on more than two million textual descriptions of lobbying activities. We then use the biLCM to make quantitative measurements of actors' community memberships ranging from narrow targeted interactions according to industry interests and jurisdictional committee membership to broad multifaceted connections across multiple policy domains.","[Kim, In Song] MIT, Dept Polit Sci, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Kunisky, Dmitriy] NYU, Courant Inst Math Sci, Dept Math, 251 Mercer St, New York, NY 10012 USA",,"Kim, IS (corresponding author), MIT, Dept Polit Sci, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",insong@mit.edu; kunisky@cims.nyu.edu,,,"National Science Foundation [SES-1264090, SES-1725235]",National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"This work was supported by the National Science Foundation (SES-1264090, SES-1725235 to I.K.).",,48,1,1,4,7,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1047-1987,1476-4989,,POLIT ANAL,Polit.

This article focuses on the restyling of propaganda in China, particularly the role of Chinese state-run media in the making of soft propaganda - propagandistic content packaged in sleek and entertaining formats. Building upon Bourdieu's field theory, this article illuminates Chinese state-run media's capacity to refract external pressures, such as digitization, to enhance their status and the resilience of the political regime. It reveals their brokering role in a heterogeneous 'thought work' network, comprised of state-affiliated units and private actors, where different forms of capital are exchanged. Drawing on in-depth interviews with online news staff in three central-level state-run outlets in China, my analysis challenges the discourse of digital technologies as inherently liberating forces and accentuates their multivocality, namely the flexible ways in which technological innovation is interpreted and practiced in concrete institutional contexts, serving pre-existing priorities and interests. It shows how innovation can function as a legitimation device serving organizations' and individuals' quests for political and symbolic capital within bureaucratic systems.","[Zou, Sheng] Univ Michigan, Int Inst, 500 Church St Suite 300, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",,"Zou, S (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Int Inst, 500 Church St Suite 300, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",szou@umich.edu,,,,,,,36,4,4,9,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

Using configurational analyses and data from banks in OECD countries, we identify multiple equifinal combinations of conditions associated with over- and underconformity. We also find that over- and underconformity have different drivers. We conjecture that while overconformity is associated with a shareholder-management coalition in liberal market economies, underconformity results from multiple complex combinations of national and organizational conditions that often include dominant blockholders, strong labor rights, and small organizational size. We leverage these findings to abduct theoretical insights on nonconformity to global corporate governance norms.

Findings revealed that Black womxn audiences (from various age groups) embodied an intersectional resistance discourse of disrespectability ( Cooper, 2012, 2017, 2018) through their (non)verbal behaviors and an ecology of the senses (i.e., sight and sound) that were situated at the intersection of ratchetness, playfulness, and informality.

That is why vocabulary tests have a central role in language proficiency assessment. Although many people study Italian as second language (L2), an easy-to-use vocabulary test to measure lexical proficiency is still missing. In this work, we aim to fill this gap by presenting LexITA, which is an objective, reliable, and quick assessment of Italian receptive vocabulary.

The study aimed to find out students' perceptions about the use of translanguaging to understand academic concepts. The study used five first-year South African medical students at a South African university who participated in a focus group discussion. The focus group discussion aimed to find out if the use of translanguaging enhances students' comprehension of texts. Participants affirm that with translanguaging, understanding of difficult academic concepts in English can be enhanced. Findings from this study prompt me to assert that multilingualism is a useful asset that can be leveraged by using translanguaging in multilingual classrooms to enhance reading comprehension.

These gains do not come at the expense of white students' academic performance, which also appears to improve. Turning to the policy mechanisms that may explain these effects, we find that an increase in minority representation leads to greater capital funding and a larger proportion of district principals who are non-white. We find no significant effects of minority representation on school segregation, the reclassification of English language learners, or teacher staffing.","[Kogan, Vladimir] Ohio State Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Lavertu, Stephane] Ohio State Univ, John Glenn Coll Publ Affairs, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Peskowitz, Zachary] Emory Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA",,"Kogan, V (corresponding author), Ohio State Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.",kogan.18@osu.edu; lavertu.1@osu.edu; zachary.f.peskowitz@emory.edu,,"Peskowitz, Zachary/0000-0001-8765-4573",Spencer Foundation through a Lyle Spencer Research Award,Spencer Foundation through a Lyle Spencer Research Award,"This work was generously supported by the Spencer Foundation through a Lyle Spencer Research Award.

To study other-regarding behavior, we fielded an experiment through a text-to-give campaign in Greece. Donations did not increase with an appeal to the in-group (Greek child) relative to a control (child), but they were halved with reference to a stigmatized out-group (Roma child). An appeal to fundamental rights, a common advocacy strategy, did not reduce the generosity gap. Donations to all groups were lower near Roma communities and declined disproportionately for the Roma appeal. Qualitative research in 12 communities complements our experiment. We conclude that NGO fundraising strategies that narrowly emphasize either in-groups or out-groups, or fundamental rights language, may not be as effective as broader appeals, and we discuss implications for public goods provision in an era of growing nationalism.","[Linos, Katerina] Univ Calif Berkeley, Law, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Jakli, Laura] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Carlson, Melissa] Stanford Univ, Ctr Int Secur & Cooperat, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",,"Linos, K (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Law, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",klinos@berkeley.edu; ljakli@fas.harvard.edu; melcarl@stanford.edu,,"Jakli, Laura/0000-0001-8475-2231; Linos, Katerina/0000-0002-9530-0211",Carnegie Foundation; Berkeley Law's Miller Center for Global Challenges and the Law; Jean Monnet Program; German Academic Exchange Program; U.C.

Drawing on data from Iranian Azerbaijanis, I argue that availability and accessibility of linguistic/semiotic resources, and their categorizations as languages or language varieties, are constrained by participants' chronotopization histories. That is, the scaled images participants develop through socialization about different time-space frames and the peoples, relations, discourses, and resources therein guide their language use both from and about particular contexts. I discuss the utility of spatiotemporal understandings of repertoires of resources and normalcies in capturing the variability, dynamicity, and complexity of semiotic practices and also in addressing the controversies among scholars regarding the 'realness' of languages and hybridity of multilingual practices. Through decentralizing language(s) and foregrounding context(s) and contextualization, I argue, the chronotope enables us to analyze not only social actors' hybrid utilization of semiotic resources in meaning-making processes, but also their language ideologies and language-ideological practices, which rely heavily on the perceptions of languages as discrete systems.","[Karimzad, Farzad] Salisbury Univ, Dept English, Salisbury, MD 21801 USA",,"Karimzad, F (corresponding author), Salisbury Univ, Dept English, Salisbury, MD 21801 USA.",fkarimzad@salisbury.edu,,"Karimzad, Farzad/0000-0002-9729-4361",,,,,75,4,4,4,4,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0142-6001,1477-450X,,APPL LINGUIST,Appl.

However, listener or recipient actions-also known as interactive listening (IL)-are somewhat underrepresented in language tests. In conventional listening tests, they are not directly assessed. In speaking tests, they have often been overshadowed by an emphasis on production features or subsumed under broader constructs such as interactional competence. This article is an effort to represent the rich IL phenomena that can be found in peer interactive speaking assessments, where the candidate-candidate format and discussion task offer opportunities to elicit and assess IL. Taking a close look at candidate discourse and nonverbal actions through a conversation analytic approach, the analysis focuses on three IL features (i) listenership displays, (ii) contingent responses, and (iii) collaborative completions, and unpacks their relative strength in evidencing listener understanding. This article concludes by making a case for revisiting the role of IL, calling for more explicit inclusion of IL in L2 assessment as well as pedagogy.","[Lam, Daniel M.

However, some of the recent research on civilian targeting does not fit neatly into this dichotomy-such as research comparing subnational units or armed groups across conflicts or research relying on geo-referenced event data for multiple conflicts. We review the literature and advocate moving beyond the language of the micro- and macro-level divide, instead focusing on the determinants of violence against civilians at five different levels of analysis: international, domestic, subnational, organizational, and individual.

We review the concept's history, its high point under Parsons, the reasons for its demise, its continued use in some subfields (e.g., gender, race and ethnicity, education), and alternative concepts used to explain social reproduction. We then suggest that something is lost when socialization is avoided or isolated in particular subfields. Without socialization, conceptions of social reproduction face problems of history, power, and transferability. We close by outlining a postfunctionalist agenda for socialization research, providing a framework for a new theory of socialization, one that builds off of cognitive science, pragmatism, the study of language, the reinterrogation of values, and the development of ideology in political socialization.","[Guhin, Jeffrey] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Sociol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Calarco, Jessica McCrory] Indiana Univ, Dept Sociol, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Miller-Idriss, Cynthia] Amer Univ, Sch Publ Affairs, Washington, DC 20016 USA; [Miller-Idriss, Cynthia] Amer Univ, Sch Educ, Washington, DC 20016 USA",,"Guhin, J (corresponding author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Sociol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",guhin@soc.ucla.edu; jcalarco@indiana.edu; cynthia@american.edu,,"Miller-Idriss, Cynthia/0000-0002-2849-0799",,,,,152,13,13,19,33,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",0360-0572,1545-2115,978-0-8243-2247-2,ANNU REV SOCIOL,Annu.

I track bills introduced at bureaucrats' request across 11 state legislatures. Legislatures extensively draw from agencies' expertise in forming the agenda and crafting session law, with 9% of introduced bills and 21% of law coming from bureaucrats. A difference-in-differences analysis shows that committee chairs and legislators in the majority introduce more administration-initiated bills.

The scientific diagnosis of the Anthropocene has further generated critical discussion in the social sciences on the need to understand the diversity of local cultural responses to global environmental crises, ranging from climate change to species extinction. This article proposes that a 'green applied linguistics' can offer empirical insights into the role of language and discourse in mediating diverse human relationships with animals and nature. Taking human interactions with protected wildlife as one aspect of these wider socio-environmental debates, this article builds on recent embodied, materialist and posthumanist research in applied linguistics to suggest that nexus analysis offers a holistic methodology to examine the problematic ways people become caught up with threatened species through their semiotic practices.

The recent legal steps reflect growing public outcry over corporate data misuses and lack of appropriate legislation. The findings suggest that the issue public of Twitter users in this study largely considered corporations and the government as untrustworthy actors for privacy legislation. The political distrust was raising doubts over regulatory capture and if a future US federal privacy law will be weaker than state laws (e.g., CCPA) while overriding them. The study explores implications of the findings on the current deadlock over the state preemption clause in developing a comprehensive federal privacy law. I argue that the emerging regulatory efforts on data privacy may not be effective unless the public trust in institutions is regained in the US and that the continuing absence of a federal law amid the political distrust can leave people with limited individual privacy strategies as a result.","[Baik, Jeeyun (Sophia)] Univ Southern Calif, Annenberg Sch Commun & Journalism, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA",,"Baik, J (corresponding author), Univ Southern Calif, Annenberg Sch Commun & Journalism, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA.",jeeyunba@usc.edu,"Baik, Jeeyun Sophia/AAU-2277-2020","Baik, Jeeyun Sophia/0000-0001-5057-1432",,,,,57,1,1,10,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

My inquiry here explores whether there exists anything comparably schematic to wedges and frames at work in attempts by American politicians not to polarize but to find consensus, not to cater to extremes but moderate them. Despite the seeming paucity of such efforts in American public discourse, there is one such common and as-yet untheorized scheme, which uses the two issue positions involved in wedges to overcome the ill effects of reframing and the two value dimensions involved in reframing to overcome the ill effects of wedges. I elaborate this discursive structure by examining its presence in a number of American political debates, showing how it differs from other contemporary normative-theoretic frameworks for understanding compromise in American politics.","[Stark, Andrew] Univ Toronto, Strateg Management & Polit Sci, Toronto, ON, Canada",,"Stark, A (corresponding author), Univ Toronto, Strateg Management & Polit Sci, Toronto, ON, Canada.",stark@rotman.utoronto.ca,,,,,,,102,0,0,3,7,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0003-0554,1537-5943,,AM POLIT SCI REV,Am.

A Theory of Goal-Dependent Political Evaluation,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,PARTISAN BIAS; OPINION; POLARIZATION,"Rather than exhibiting bias or open-minded reasoning at baseline, we argue that information processing is motivated by whatever goals a context makes salient. Thus, if politics feels like debate, people will be motivated to argue for their side. If politics feels like deliberation, they will be motivated to seek consensus through open-minded processing. Results from three experiments demonstrate: (1) Politics evokes thoughts similar to conflictual contexts and dissimilar from deliberative contexts. (2) Consequently, information labeled political primes the motivation to counterargue, leading to opinion polarization. Absent such labeling, no such motivation is evident, explaining why bias is common but not inherent to politics. (3) Despite this capacity for bias, people can be motivated to actively process and accept counterattitudinal information by simply making the value of open-mindedness salient. This suggests open-minded discourse is possible even absent motivation to evaluate information accurately. We conclude by discussing the implications of our research for political discourse.","[Groenendyk, Eric] Univ Memphis, Dept Polit Sci, 419 Clement Hall, Memphis, TN 38152 USA; [Krupnikov, Yanna] SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Polit Sci, S723 SBS, Stony Brook, NY 11790 USA",,"Groenendyk, E (corresponding author), Univ Memphis, Dept Polit Sci, 419 Clement Hall, Memphis, TN 38152 USA.",grnendyk@memphis.edu; yanna.krupnikov@stonybrook.edu,,,,,,,46,10,10,5,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0092-5853,1540-5907,,AM J POLIT SCI,Am.

By contrast, this article develops and tests the theory that certain forms of censorship-in particular, prohibitions on popular culture-serve not only to limit political information but also to reward dictators' supporters. Using text analysis of all 8,000 films reviewed for distribution during Chile's dictatorship, I demonstrate that rather than focusing only on sensitive political topics, censors banned movies containing content considered immoral. Through a combination of qualitative and quantitative evidence, I show that these patterns cannot be explained by masked political content, distributor self-censorship, or censor preferences. Instead, they reflect the regime's use of censorship as a reward for supporters, particularly conservative Catholic groups. My findings suggest that even repressive measures can be used in part to maintain support for authoritarian regimes.","[Esberg, Jane] Princeton Univ, Empir Studies Conflict Project, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Esberg, Jane] Int Crisis Grp, Brussels, Belgium",,"Esberg, J (corresponding author), Princeton Univ, Empir Studies Conflict Project, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.;Esberg, J (corresponding author), Int Crisis Grp, Brussels, Belgium.",jesberg@crisisgroup.org,,,Stanford's Interdisciplinary Graduate Fellowship; Stanford's VPGE; Stanford's Europe Center; Stanford's Institute for Research in the Social Sciences,Stanford's Interdisciplinary Graduate Fellowship; Stanford's VPGE; Stanford's Europe Center; Stanford's Institute for Research in the Social Sciences,"I am grateful to Consuelo Amat, Lisa Blaydes, Martin Dimitrov, Mathilde Emeriau, Natalia Garbiras-Diaz, Christian Fong, Francisco Garfias, Dimitar D.

Key findings indicate that some young masculinities subordinate non-hegemonic gendered identities, namely those who identify as female and transgender, in and through gendered and sexualised forms of online harassment or are complicit in these practices. Male research participants are more likely than any other gendered group to use 'free speech' discourses to legitimate online harassment directed at transgendered and cis-female subjects. Some white, heterosexual males, who occupy a dominant position in Britain's gendered and racial social order, appropriate discursive practices associated with identity politics, which have historically been used by non-hegemonic gendered identities to challenge social inequities, to claim they are 'victims' of this society. We argue that these new emerging forms of hybridised hegemonic masculinity, which appropriate and reconfigure the discursive practices of non-hegemonic gendered identities, reproduce and conceal patriarchal systems of power in digitised spaces. We suggest more research is needed to better understand these practices, their relationship to alt-right influencers and men's rights activists, and their implications for digital hegemonic masculinities at the local level of UK university campuses.","[Haslop, Craig; O'Rourke, Fiona] Univ Liverpool, Dept Commun & Media, 19 Abercromby Sq, Liverpool L69 7ZG, Merseyside, England",,"Haslop, C (corresponding author), Univ Liverpool, Dept Commun & Media, 19 Abercromby Sq, Liverpool L69 7ZG, Merseyside, England.",Craig.Haslop@liverpool.ac.uk; F.O-Rourke@liverpool.ac.uk,,"haslop, craig/0000-0002-3183-5671",Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) [CTR10005],Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE)),This research was supported by funding from the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) (CTR10005).,,40,3,3,1,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

We then provide a new statistical model of distinctiveness that extends traditional efforts to statistically characterize the style of authors and apply it to a corpus of Hansard speeches from 1935 to 2018. In the aggregate, we find no evidence for the claim of more homogeneity. But this hides intriguing covariate effects: at the MP-level, panel regression results demonstrate that on average, more senior backbenchers tend to be less different in speech terms.

Among the most prominent pieces of information people encounter are a candidate's gender, obtained from images of the candidate's face, and the candidate's partisan identification, often represented as text. This feature of the environment is important given previous work showing that individuals infer gender categories from faces rapidly and effortlessly. In this study (N = 113), we use eye movements to determine how individuals assign stereotypical policy positions to candidates in an environment in which photos of candidates' faces are paired with labels of their partisan IDs. We find that politically-knowledgeable individuals are more likely to use partisan- than gender-based stereotypes. In contrast, political novices did not prioritize one type of stereotype over the other.

This political communication style runs counter to deliberative democratic virtues such as respectful interactions and well-justified arguments. Its use is therefore problematic from a normative point of view, yet there are indications that it is an effective communication style to persuade citizens. Two survey experiments - text and audio - were developed to investigate the effects of uncivil communication and simplistic argumentation on political trust and on persuasive power in political election debates. The results show that 1) uncivil communication lowers political trust and is slightly less convincing than civil communication, 2) simplistic argumentation, i.e. political arguments presented in ill- or non-justified ways, does not affect political trust and is not more persuasive than well-justified argumentation, and 3) the strongest violation of social norms, i.e. a combined use of uncivil communication and simplistic argumentation, decreases both trust in the political candidate and persuasive power. Interestingly, politically cynical citizens and citizens who do not value inclusionary debates react differently to uncivil communication and simplistic argumentation: their level of trust does not decline and they are persuaded slightly more by simplistic arguments expressed in uncivil ways.","[Goovaerts, Ine; Marien, Sofie] Univ Leuven, Ctr Polit Sci Res, Pk Str 45,Box 3602, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium",,"Goovaerts, I (corresponding author), Univ Leuven, Ctr Polit Sci Res, Pk Str 45,Box 3602, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium.",ine.goovaerts@kuleuven.be,"Marien, Sofie/M-9247-2016","Marien, Sofie/0000-0002-3060-621X; Goovaerts, Ine/0000-0002-5893-4442",FWO Research Foundation Flanders [G068417N]; Internal Funds KU Leuven [C14/17/022],FWO Research Foundation Flanders(FWO); Internal Funds KU Leuven,This study was supported by a Project Grant from FWO Research Foundation Flanders (no.

Rather than forcing civilians to comply with the state, checkpoint apparatus instead change the nature and texture of resistance. I suggest that checkpoints structure social connections for civilians on the ground. Checkpoint apparatus which inhibit social connection engender a feeling of hopelessness and foster support for individual, often violent, resistance. Where checkpoints isolate a community as a whole but did not disrupt within-community social connections, citizens maintain hope for the possibility of change, which facilitates a preference for collective resistance. This article identifies troubling consequences checkpoints have on civilians and highlights how oppressive state power can limit some modalities of resistance only to engender support for others.","[Gade, Emily Kalah] Emory Univ, Polit Sci, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA",,"Gade, EK (corresponding author), Emory Univ, Polit Sci, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA.",emily.gade@emory.edu,,"Gade, Emily/0000-0002-9061-7869",Chester Fritz Boeing International Research Grant (UW); Ioan G.

We conduct an analysis of cohabitants of individuals randomly assigned to receive microtargeted mobilization ads during a municipal election. Results show that digital ads generate a spillover effect, though the effect is moderated by district competitiveness. This contagion can occur whether the original subjects are mobilized or not, though there is a strong association between ads that mobilize their intended target and spread within the household. To explain these results, we advance a distinction between technological and social spillover, with the former grounded in the affordances of the medium of mobilization, and argue that our results are suggestive of both phenomena.","[Haenschen, Katherine] Virginia Tech, Dept Commun, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA; [Jennings, Jay] Univ Texas Austin, Ctr Media Engagement, Austin, TX 78712 USA",,"Haenschen, K (corresponding author), Virginia Tech, Dept Commun, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA.",katherine.haenschen@gmail.com,,"Jennings, Jay/0000-0001-5066-5519; Haenschen, Katherine/0000-0003-0191-2880",Meadows Foundation; Annette Strauss Institute for Civic Life [2017010020],Meadows Foundation; Annette Strauss Institute for Civic Life,This work was supported by the Meadows Foundation; Annette Strauss Institute for Civic Life [2017010020]; and Garrett and Cecilia Boone.,,35,0,0,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1933-1681,1933-169X,,J INF TECHNOL POLITI,J.

A political landscape characterized by international consensus and compliance in the 1990s (as opposed to tariff wars and logistical nationalism) further buttressed this new ideology, leading to a newly multilingual centripetality in the global management of meaning. Based on historical examples and evidence from computational engineering, this article tracks the extraordinary growth of this sector and its implications for other arenas of language practice, implications that indude: monolingualization, securitization, dehistoricization, lexicaliztation, and the reduction of 'culture' to its most overt linguistic forms.","[Gramling, David] Univ Arizona, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA",,"Gramling, D (corresponding author), Univ Arizona, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA.",dgl@email.arizona.edu,,,,,,,63,3,3,1,15,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0142-6001,1477-450X,,APPL LINGUIST,Appl.

Yet, mothers also grapple with the demands of an unmarked global hearing culture, especially as their children's deafness becomes mediated by technology and medical intervention, under the guise of progress, social mobility, equity, and inclusion (Lane et al. 1996). Access to spoken English through technological aids supposedly 'solves' the perceived 'problem' of communication and cultural difference between mother and child. But what is at stake in this process of translation aided by new technologies? I take a critical discourse analytic approach to analyze videotaped interviews with six hearing mothers. Hearing mother interviewees displayed ambivalent shifts in footing, in particular, mode-switches, which, I argue, paralleled the ambiguous subject positions of their deaf children who they perceive as both deaf (without implants) and hearing (with implants). This study brings to light the complex role technology and 'cochlear implant culture' play in shaping an instrumentalized view of language with the objective of participating in local and global hearing culture.","[Johnson, Jennifer T.] Stanford Univ, Program Writing & Rhetor, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",,"Johnson, JT (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Program Writing & Rhetor, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",jennj@stanford.edu,,,,,,,51,0,0,2,10,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0142-6001,1477-450X,,APPL LINGUIST,Appl.

But what precisely counts as culture in the global workplace of the MNC? What does it exactly mean to be able to translate across cultures under the regimes of evaluation adopted by MNCs? In this article, I consider these questions through a discussion of the corporate discourse of diversity management, in which the cultural diversity of the workforce is understood as a resource for maximizing profit. Based on a critical review of diversity management literature and a study on Korean managers working for non-Korean MNCs in Singapore, I first show how diversity management's claim of openness and inclusivity actually works to reproduce unequal relations in the workplace. I then argue that attention to the politics of translation, where the ideological nature of evaluations of cultural (in)commensurability is highlighted, is needed for applied linguists' engagement with language and communication in the multicultural workplace.","[Park, Joseph Sung-Yul] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept English Language & Literature, Singapore, Singapore",,"Park, JSY (corresponding author), Natl Univ Singapore, Dept English Language & Literature, Singapore, Singapore.",ellpjs@nus.edu.sg,,"Park, Joseph Sung-Yul/0000-0003-2903-4813",,,,,40,3,3,4,23,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0142-6001,1477-450X,,APPL LINGUIST,Appl.

Over the past decade, digital media have played an important role for challenging authoritarian rule around the globe. Especially in ideological communities sustained by strict taboos, digital media hold the potential to subvert hegemonic discourses. In this study, we make use of an incident that forced Israel's Ultra-Orthodox community to address its long-standing taboo and hateful attitudes toward LGBT and Queer issues. In July 2015, an Ultra-Orthodox community member attacked participants of the Jerusalem Gay Pride Parade, murdering one and wounding six. While traditional community media attempted to ignore the event, two major Ultra-Orthodox news websites fell outside the control exercised by the community leadership, and enabled subversive discussions within the Ultra-Orthodox community. Through a process of negotiating the meaning of the attack, these discussions resulted in a reframing of the boundaries of the community, breaking a path for further contestation and debate. Using grounded theory analysis, this article contributes to a better understanding of the role of digital media in enabling contestation and challenging established power structures within authoritarian closed communities.","[David, Yossi; Baden, Christian] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Commun, Jerusalem, Israel",,"David, Y (corresponding author), Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Commun & Journalism, IL-9190501 Jerusalem, Israel.",davidyossi4@gmail.com,"David, Yossi/AGH-9077-2022","David, Yossi/0000-0001-8020-0317; Baden, Christian/0000-0002-3771-3413",,,,,42,7,7,1,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

These resources are used in the management of turn and sequence and the marking of stance and affect, and they represent an aspect of the interactional machinery that is as elusive as it is powerful. Phenomena long assumed to be beyond the purview of linguistic inquiry emerge as systematically deployed practices whose ambiguous degree of control and convention allows participants to carry out subtle interactional work without committing to specific words. While these resources have been characterized as nonlexical, nonverbal, or nonconventional, I propose that they are unified in their liminality: They work well precisely because they equivocate between sound and speech.

We were able to reach three conclusions from the participant experiences presented in this article. First, digital dating and its constitutive norms play a role in maintaining certain tropes of cultural representation of racial subjects and securing cultural power within an overarching system of white racial entitlement. Second, we found that agency is key to understanding the female participants' dating experiences.

Particularly, Cox, Fiva, and Smith show how list PR enable party leaders to discipline members and build cohesive parties. Relying on roll-call votes across the Norwegian 1919 electoral reform from two-round single-member plurality to closed-list PR, they show that the internal party cohesion increased following the reform. We investigate how the Norwegian electoral reform changed the content of parliamentary speeches.

I expect this to hold among copartisans who are exposed to party rhetoric. To test my argument, I measure moral rhetoric by text-analyzing party manifestos from six English-speaking democracies and measure mobilization using copartisan turnout in survey data. The results support my argument. Furthermore, I find evidence in support of the theoretical mechanism using survey experiments and panel survey data from Britain.

On the one hand, ethnic media can mobilize and inform voters. On the other hand, it can serve as a source of diversion and reduce the desire to participate. To evaluate these competing possibilities, we implement a geographic regression discontinuity (GRD) approach involving Federal Communication Commission reception boundaries for Spanish-language television stations in two states. Additionally, we replicate and unpack our GRD analyses using three nationally representative samples of Latinos. Across multiple studies, we find that access to Spanish-language television is associated with decreases in turnout, ethnic civic participation, and political knowledge.

Our dataset covers 27 countries and 36 years and contains nearly 2.7 million survey responses to 109 unique issue questions. Estimating an ordinal group-level IRT model in each of four issue domains, we obtain biennial estimates of the absolute economic conservatism, relative economic conservatism, social conservatism, and immigration conservatism of men and women in three age categories in each country. Aggregating the group-level estimates yields estimates of the average conservatism in national publics in each biennium between 1981-82 and 2015-16. The four measures exhibit contrasting cross-sectional cleavages and distinct temporal dynamics, illustrating the multidimensionality of mass ideology in Europe. Subjecting our measures to a series of validation tests, we show that the constructs they measure are distinct and substantively important and that they perform as well as or better than one-dimensional proxies for mass conservatism (left-right self-placement and median voter scores). We foresee many uses for these scores by scholars of public opinion, electoral behavior, representation, and policy feedback.","[Caughey, Devin] MIT, Dept Polit Sci, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [O'Grady, Tom] UCL, Dept Polit Sci, London, England; [Warshaw, Christopher] George Washington Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Washington, DC 20052 USA",,"Caughey, D (corresponding author), MIT, Dept Polit Sci, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",caughey@mit.edu; t.o'grady@ucl.ac.uk; warshaw@gwu.edu,"Warshaw, Christopher/AAM-4838-2021","Caughey, Devin/0000-0001-6419-6805; Warshaw, Christopher/0000-0002-2769-4028",,,,,88,35,35,0,9,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0003-0554,1537-5943,,AM POLIT SCI REV,Am.

Spatial econometric techniques have been proposed to empirically model such interdependencies and to closely convert theoretical expectations into statistical models. Yet, these models often ignore that the parties' ideological positions are latent variables and, as such, accompanied by a quantifiable amount of uncertainty. As a result, the implausible assumption of perfectly measured covariates impedes a proper evaluation of theoretical propositions. In order to bridge this gap between theory and empirics, the present work combines a spatial econometric model and a Bayesian dynamic item response model. The proposed model accurately accounts for measurement uncertainty and simultaneously estimates the parties' ideological positions and their spatial interdependencies. To verify the model's utility, I apply it to recorded votes from the sixteen German state legislatures in the period from 1988 to 2016. While exhibiting a notable degree of ideological mobility, the results indicate only moderate spatial dependencies among parties of the same party family. More importantly, the analysis illustrates how measurement uncertainty can lead to substantively different results which stresses the importance of appropriately incorporating theoretical expectations into statistical models.","[Juhl, Sebastian] Univ Mannheim, Sonderforsch Bereich 884, B6,30-32,Room 337, D-68159 Mannheim, Baden Wurttembe, Germany",,"Juhl, S (corresponding author), Univ Mannheim, Sonderforsch Bereich 884, B6,30-32,Room 337, D-68159 Mannheim, Baden Wurttembe, Germany.",sebastian.juhl@gess.uni-mannheim.de,"Juhl, Sebastian/I-7239-2019","Juhl, Sebastian/0000-0002-7123-5398",German Research Foundation (DFG) [SFB 884]; University of Mannheim's Graduate School of Economic and Social Sciences (GESS),German Research Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)); University of Mannheim's Graduate School of Economic and Social Sciences (GESS),"An earlier version of this work has been presented at the EPSA conference 2017 in Milan, Italy and the 2018 annual conference of the PSA Political Methodology Group in Essex, UK.

The results of two experimental studies with U.S. adults (n = 210 and n = 630) suggest that political speeches can evoke elevation responses, and that such an elevation response is not affected by the political party of the speaker. An elevating response was associated with greater positivity toward politics and the speaker (Studies 1 and 2), as well as increased perceived closeness with one's own party and the opposing party (Study 2). Elevation was also associated with lower political cynicism. These outcomes further predicted both intentions to participate in the political process and information-seeking behavior.

These inconsistencies demonstrate that the mechanisms behind a potential bilingualism-to-EF relationship remain unclear. Multiple factors likely impact EF outcomes among bilinguals, including proficiency and extent and type and environment of language usage. The current study explored EF skills among a relatively homogeneous sample of 50 Spanish-English bilingual young adults to provide insights into the environmental and individual characteristics that contribute to EF diversity. Hierarchical regression modeling revealed that more balanced bilingual language usage in specific home-based tasks (particularly TV watching), and higher self-reported ability in Spanish and English significantly predicted higher EF. Results support the developing empirical consensus that greater engagement in dual-language contexts bears a positive relationship to EF. The finding that watching TV with a balanced language ratio has a significant positive relationship to EF opens strong potential opportunities for bilinguals to access EF benefits with minimal effort.","[Smith, Sara Ashley] Univ S Florida, Tampa, FL 33620 USA; [Briggs, Jessica G.] Univ Oxford, Oxford, England; [Pothier, Holly; Garcia, Jorge Nicholas, Jr.] Calif State Univ East Bay, Hayward, CA USA",,"Smith, SA (corresponding author), Univ S Florida, Tampa, FL 33620 USA.",sarasmith3@usf.edu,"Baffoe-Djan, Jessica Briggs/E-6611-2016","Baffoe-Djan, Jessica Briggs/0000-0002-5464-1490",,,,,58,2,2,2,8,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0142-6001,1477-450X,,APPL LINGUIST,Appl.

Leveraging a targeted survey of 2,070 island residents and distance to Turkey as an instrument, we find that direct exposure to refugee arrivals induces sizable and lasting increases in natives' hostility toward refugees, immigrants, and Muslim minorities; support for restrictive asylum and immigration policies; and political engagement to effect such exclusionary policies. Since refugees only passed through these islands, our findings challenge both standard economic and cultural explanations of anti-immigrant sentiment and show that mere exposure suffices in generating lasting increases in hostility.","[Hangartner, Dominik; Marbach, Moritz] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Ctr Comparat & Int Studies, Zurich, Switzerland; [Hangartner, Dominik] London Sch Econ, Dept Govt, London, England; [Dinas, Elias] European Univ Inst, Robert Schuman Ctr Adv Studies, Swiss Chair Federalism Democracy & Int Governance, Florence, Italy; [Dinas, Elias] European Univ Inst, Dept Social & Polit Sci, Florence, Italy; [Dinas, Elias] Univ Oxford, Dept Polit & Int Relat, Oxford, England; [Matakos, Konstantinos] Kings Coll London, Dept Polit Econ, London, England; [Xefteris, Dimitrios] Univ Cyprus, Dept Econ, Nicosia, Cyprus",,"Hangartner, D (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Ctr Comparat & Int Studies, Zurich, Switzerland.;Hangartner, D (corresponding author), London Sch Econ, Dept Govt, London, England.",d.hangartner@lse.ac.uk; elias.dinas@eui.eu; moritz.marbach@gess.ethz.ch; konstantinos.matakos@kcl.ac.uk; xefteris.dimitrios@ucy.ac.cy,"Xefteris, Dimitrios/S-4080-2017","Xefteris, Dimitrios/0000-0001-7397-5288; Matakos, Konstantinos/0000-0002-3511-197X",British Academy for a Small Leverhulme Grant [CTR00340]; Leverhulme Trust,British Academy for a Small Leverhulme Grant; Leverhulme Trust(Leverhulme Trust),"The survey was fielded by the Survey Unit of the University of Macedonia according to our sampling frame and in line with the ethics policy of the London School of Economics and Political Science for human subjects research.

My analysis challenges this conventional wisdom, showing that the coalition of Republicans and southern Democrats in support of the sex amendment to Title VII was consistent with broader patterns of support for the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) in the early to mid-20th century. In other words, support appears to have been sincere, not sophisticated-proponents preferred a CRA with the sex amendment to one without. I proceed to show that concern about the direct impact on women, and not simply the instrumental impact on labor, played an important role in motivating this support. But, I also find reason for caution in interpreting support for workplace rights as evidence of broad support for women's rights at this time.","[Krimmel, Katherine] Barnard Coll, New York, NY 10027 USA",,"Krimmel, K (corresponding author), Barnard Coll, New York, NY 10027 USA.",kkrimmel@barnard.edu,,,,,,,48,0,0,0,2,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0362-9805,1939-9162,,LEGIS STUD QUART,Legis.

The data show a dramatic increase in the frequency with which PC-phrases are used in the early 1990s. From this time onwards, the phrases are often used as a means of passing evaluative subjective opinions off as objectively reported facts, especially in reviews of cultural events, where they figure prominently. In contrast to earlier studies, our data show that PC-phrases are not inherently negative; this applies primarily to discourse on environment and business, where to be PC often implies being environmentally or socially conscious in a positive sense. Nevertheless, negative or ironic uses of the terms predominate. Most often they express criticism of unspoken cultural norms rather than being attempts to close down debate or criticizing the replacement of offensive terms by more neutral expressions.","[Granath, Solveig; Ullen, Magnus] Karlstad Univ, Dept Language Literature & Intercultural Studies, Univ Gatan 1, SE-65188 Karlstad, Sweden",,"Granath, S (corresponding author), Karlstad Univ, Dept Language Literature & Intercultural Studies, Univ Gatan 1, SE-65188 Karlstad, Sweden.",solveig.granath@kau.se,,,,,,,30,1,1,1,22,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0142-6001,1477-450X,,APPL LINGUIST,Appl.

Based on sequential analysis of how the knowledge asymmetries are brought to the fore of interaction and how they are subsequently dealt with, the current study illustrates how learning opportunities are generated in conversation-for-learning, that is, by collaborative achievement of definition sequences (Markee 1994). Interaction provides an observable space where interactional practices deployed by the participants to achieve and maintain intersubjectivity can be observed and appropriated.

However, there is little consensus on the interpretation of this correlation: is it causal or is it an artifact of selection bias? We address this question by exploiting six major compulsory schooling reforms in five Western European countries-Denmark, France, Great Britain, the Netherlands, and Sweden-that have recently experienced politically influential anti-immigration movements. On average, we find that compelling students to remain in secondary school for at least an additional year decreases anti-immigration attitudes later in life. Instrumental variable estimates demonstrate that, among such compliers, an additional year of secondary schooling substantially reduces the probability of opposing immigration, believing that immigration erodes a country's quality of life, and feeling close to far-right anti-immigration parties. These results suggest that rising post-war educational attainment has mitigated the rise of anti-immigration movements.

In the study, biliteracy was operationalized as reading proficiency and vocabulary knowledge in two languages, which was tested with measures of word decoding, reading comprehension, and vocabulary breadth and depth. The study was designed to allow for cross-sectional, longitudinal, and cross-linguistic analyses of data. Overall, the results showed that participation in MTI contributed positively to participants' results on Somali reading comprehension, beyond the influence of chronological age, age of arrival, and reported home language and literacy use. Furthermore, higher results in Somali were associated with higher results on the same measures in Swedish, in particular for the reading measures. In sum, the results indicate that MTI has an impact on some aspects of literacy proficiency in the mother tongue, despite the restricted time allocated for it (<1 h/week). They also indicate that MTI, albeit indirectly, may benefit the stated proficiencies in the language of schooling.","[Ganuza, Natalia] Stockholm Univ, Ctr Res Bilingualism, Bilingualism, Stockholm, Sweden; [Hedman, Christina] Stockholm Univ, Dept Language Educ, Swedish Second Language, Stockholm, Sweden",,"Ganuza, N (corresponding author), Stockholm Univ, Dept Swedish Language & Multilingualism, Ctr Res Bilingualism, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden.;Hedman, C (corresponding author), Stockholm Univ, Dept Language Educ, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden.",natalia.ganuza@biling.su.se; christina.hedman@isd.su.se,,"Ganuza, Natalia/0000-0002-0444-2207",Swedish Research Council [721-2012-4275],Swedish Research Council(Swedish Research CouncilEuropean Commission),This work was supported by the Swedish Research Council (grant number 721-2012-4275).,,65,12,12,4,18,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0142-6001,1477-450X,,APPL LINGUIST,Appl.

Drawing on data from a multi-year research project in the virtual world Second Life, I explore disability experiences of entrepreneurism, focusing on intersections of creativity, risk, and inclusion. Since its founding in 2003, Second Life has witnessed significant disability participation. Many such residents engage in forms of entrepreneurship that destabilize dominant understandings of digital labor. Most make little or no profit; some labor at a loss. Something is being articulated through languages and practices of entrepreneurship, something that challenges the ableist paradigms that still deeply structure both digital socialities and conceptions of labor.Disability is typically assumed to be incompatible with work, an assumption often reinforced by policies that withdraw benefits from disabled persons whose income exceeds a meagre threshold. Responses to such exclusion appear when disabled persons in Second Life frame entrepreneur' as a selfhood characterized by creativity and contribution, not just initiative and risk. In navigating structural barriers with regard to income and access, including affordances of the virtual world itself, they implicitly contest reconfigurations of personhood under neoliberalism, where the laboring self becomes framed not as a worker earning an hourly wage, but as a business with the ability' to sell services. This reveals how digital technology reworks the interplay of selfhood, work, and value - but in ways that remain culturally specific and embedded in forms of inequality.","[Boellstorff, Tom] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Anthropol, 3151 Social Sci Plaza, Irvine, CA 92697 USA",,"Boellstorff, T (corresponding author), Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Anthropol, 3151 Social Sci Plaza, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.",tboellst@uci.edu,,,"National Science Foundation, Cultural Anthropology and Science, Technology, and Society Programs [1459219, 1459374]; Division Of Behavioral and Cognitive Sci [1459219] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","National Science Foundation, Cultural Anthropology and Science, Technology, and Society Programs; Division Of Behavioral and Cognitive Sci(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))","This research was funded in part by the National Science Foundation, Cultural Anthropology and Science, Technology, and Society Programs [Grants 1459219 and 1459374].",,61,10,10,9,60,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

Participants (N=138, aged 9-11) received explicit information followed by either task-essential practice in making form-meaning connections (referential activities from Processing Instruction) OR task-essential practice in spotting the form (word noticing activities). Both interventions yielded equivalent durable gains across six ecologically valid tests of comprehension and production (written and oral modalities), compared to no gains in a control group. The findings revealed that, following explicit information, input practice requiring engagement with the target feature (as proposed by Svalberg 2012) was equally effective as task-essential form-meaning connection practice, shedding important light on previous claims in the research agenda on task-essential input practice (Marsden 2006; Marsden and Chen 2011).

Focusing on media coverage of auto recalls in China, I reveal a systematic bias against foreign automakers in those newspapers under strict government control. I further analyze subnational reporting patterns, exploiting variation in the level of regional government interest in the automobile industry. The analysis suggests that the media's home bias is driven by the government's protectionist interests but rules out the alternative hypothesis that home bias simply reflects the nationalist sentiment of readers. I show that this home bias in news coverage has meaningful impact on actual consumer behavior, combining automobile sales data and information on recall-related web searches.","[Kim, Sung Eun] Korea Univ, Dept Polit Sci & Int Relat, Polit Sci, 145 Anam Ro, Seoul 02841, South Korea",,"Kim, SE (corresponding author), Korea Univ, Dept Polit Sci & Int Relat, Polit Sci, 145 Anam Ro, Seoul 02841, South Korea.",sung_kim@korea.edu,"Kim, Sung Eun/AAY-1989-2021","Kim, Sung Eun/0000-0001-6799-4343",,,,,27,8,8,1,30,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0003-0554,1537-5943,,AM POLIT SCI REV,Am.

Seeing dispositions as the key to professionalization and professional contributions, it explores the possibilities and challenges in harnessing the professional value of their transnational disposition. Semi-structured interviews were conducted to investigate the participants' position in the workplace, negotiations of the local curriculum and classroom practice, and professional interactions with colleagues and parents. The findings show that these teachers actively respond to invisibility and marginalization by drawing from their transcultural disposition to creatively but cautiously transform pedagogical practices and discourses. It is found that the presence of migrant professionals in local context provides opportunities for critical reflexivity and transnational awareness among local professionals. It is implied that the changes in thinking and awareness may lead to broad-based ideological and structural changes, which in turn promotes productive knowledge exchange.","[Gu, Michelle Mingyue] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Fac Educ, Dept Curriculum & Instruct, Shatin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Canagarajah, Suresh] Penn State Univ, Dept Appl Linguist, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Canagarajah, Suresh] Penn State Univ, Dept English, University Pk, PA 16802 USA",,"Gu, MM (corresponding author), Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Fac Educ, Dept Curriculum & Instruct, Shatin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",moongu1009@gmail.com,,,Worldwide Universities Network; Chinese University of Hong Kong,Worldwide Universities Network; Chinese University of Hong Kong(Chinese University of Hong Kong),"We are grateful to the Editors, and Reviewers for their constructive feedback on an earlier version of the manuscript, and to Professor Adrian Bailey for his valuable comments on research design of the study.

This analysis draws upon a data from middle school classrooms in the South Atlantic region of the USA and focuses particularly on the classroom experiences of six 6th-grade students classified as 'English learners' who have been in US schools since kindergarten. We use a multiple case study approach (Stake 2006) to analyze qualitative classroom observations completed in 'mainstream' classrooms alongside teacher and student interviews to examine the extent to which classroom-based peer and teacher-student interactions offer opportunities for language acquisition/development. Varied patterns of engagement and interaction were found, but most students had relatively few substantive academic discussions with peers or teachers. The diversity of our six students' experiences, and of the language expertise they demonstrate, suggests that 'LTEL' obscures more than it elucidates regarding these students' academic and linguistic strengths and needs.","[Kibler, Amanda K.; Bergey, Rebecca; Wang, Chenyu; Elreda, Lauren Molloy] Univ Virginia, Curry Sch Educ, Charlottesville, VA 22904 USA; [Karam, Fares J.] Univ Reno, Coll Educ, Nevada, NV 89577 USA; [Ehrlich, Valerie A.

But while a useful tool in revealing something of the dynamic interactions which underlie persuasive claim making, it has little to say about the role of nouns in this process. We address this gap by exploring the rhetorical functions of what we call metadiscursive nouns (such as fact, analysis, belief) and by mapping them onto a model of metadiscourse. The study examines 'metadiscursive noun + post-nominal clause' patterns, one of the most frequent structures containing such nouns, in a corpus of 120 research articles across six disciplines. Developing a rhetorically based classification and exploring the interactive and interactional use of metadiscursive nouns, we show that they are another key element of metadiscourse, offering writers a way of organizing discourse into a cohesive flow of information and of constructing a stance towards it. These interactions are further shown to realize the epistemological assumptions and rhetorical practices of particular disciplines.","[Jiang, Feng (Kevin); Hyland, Ken] Univ Hong Kong, Ctr Appl English Studies, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",,"Jiang, F (corresponding author), Univ Hong Kong, Ctr Appl English Studies, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",kevinjiang@hku.hk,"Hyland, Ken/ABH-8176-2020; Jiang, Kevin/AAT-5052-2021","Jiang, Kevin/0000-0001-7369-9498",,,,,46,36,37,22,118,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0142-6001,1477-450X,,APPL LINGUIST,Appl.

Using a novel linguistic technique to assess personality from unscripted text spoken by 2,381 CEOs of S&P 1500 firms over ten years, we show that CEOs' extraversion influences the merger and acquisition (M&A) behavior of firms above and beyond other well-established personality traits. We find that extraverted CEOs are more likely to engage in acquisitions, and to conduct larger ones, than other CEOs and that these effects are partially explained by their higher representation on boards of other firms. Moreover, we find that the acquisitive nature of extraverted CEOs reveals itself particularly in so-called weaker'' situations, in which CEOs enjoy considerable discretion to behave in ways akin to their personality traits. Subsequent analyses show that extraverted CEOs are also more likely than other CEOs to succeed in M&As, as reflected by stronger abnormal returns following acquisition announcements.","[Malhotra, Shavin] Univ Waterloo, Fac Engn, Conrad Business Entrepreneurship & Technol Ctr, 200 Univ Ave W, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada; [Reus, Taco H.] Erasmus Univ, Rotterdam Sch Management, Global Strategy, Burgemeester Oudlaan 50,Bayle Bldg, NL-3062 Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Roelofsen, Erik M.] Erasmus Univ, Rotterdam Sch Management, Int Financial Reporting & Capital Market Commun, Burgemeester Oudlaan 50,Bayle Bldg, NL-3062 Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Zhu, PengCheng] Univ San Diego, Sch Business Adm, Finance, 5998 Alcala Pk, San Diego, CA 92110 USA",,"Malhotra, S (corresponding author), Univ Waterloo, Fac Engn, Conrad Business Entrepreneurship & Technol Ctr, 200 Univ Ave W, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada.",shavin.malhotra@uwaterloo.ca; treus@rsm.nl; pzhu@sandiego.edu; eroelofsen@rsm.nl,,"Zhu, PengCheng/0000-0002-8360-2327; Reus, Taco/0000-0003-2485-7730",Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada,Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),"We thank Associate Editor Martin Kilduff and the three anonymous reviewers for their valuable and developmental feedback, and Govert Buijs, Harold Kokke, Magdalena Langosch, Jil Kratz, and Beata Matuszewska for their help in this study.

We estimate the parameters with a sparse Gaussian copula factor model that estimates the number of latent dimensions, is robust to outliers, and accounts for zero inflation in the data. To illustrate its workings, we apply our estimator to roll call votes and floor speech from recent sessions of the US Senate. We uncover two stable dimensions: one ideological and the other reflecting to Senators' leadership roles. We then show how the method can leverage common speech in order to impute missing data, recovering reliable preference estimates for rank-and-file Senators given only leadership votes.","[Kim, In Song] MIT, Dept Polit Sci, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Londregan, John] Princeton Univ, Woodrow Wilson Sch, Polit & Int Affairs, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Ratkovic, Marc] Princeton Univ, Dept Polit, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA",,"Kim, IS (corresponding author), MIT, Dept Polit Sci, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",insong@mit.EDU; jbl@princeton.edu; ratkovic@princeton.edu,"Song, In/B-2895-2017","Song, In/0000-0002-5774-1585",,,,,52,10,11,1,12,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1047-1987,1476-4989,,POLIT ANAL,Polit.

It further demonstrates the value of using a theory and text-driven discourse analytical approach for the analysis of verbal communication in a (specific health) professional domain. The UK website Netdoctor is used as a case study. Thirty exchanges from this site, on the topic of depression, were analysed using a discourse-pragmatic framework, drawing on existing theories and definitions of patient-centred communication (PCC), a classification of empathic: cotmnunication acts (Pounds 2011) and existing research on advice giving in online communication. The analysis shows that, overall, experts make wide use of PCC, particularly empathic expression, in their online responses. The author concludes that there is a high potential for the expression of PCC on Ask-the-Expert health sites and that this may be more or less exploited, depending on the restrictions imposed on the contributors by the site managers and users' expectations","[Pounds, Gabrina] Univ East Anglia, Sch Polit Philosophy Language & Commun Studies, Norwich, Norfolk, England",,"Pounds, G (corresponding author), Univ East Anglia, Sch Polit Philosophy Language & Commun Studies, Norwich, Norfolk, England.",g.pounds@uea.ac.uk,,,,,,,30,9,9,3,38,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0142-6001,1477-450X,,APPL LINGUIST,Appl.

Because our design holds constant candidates' policy positions, we can attribute the effects on vote choice directly to the choice of language over and above other candidate attributes. In two of our three experiments, the Spanish-language advertisements increased candidates' electoral support by 5 percentage points among bilinguals. We find the opposite pattern of results among English-speaking monolingual Americans, who respond very negatively to Spanish-language advertisements.

This article, based on a longitudinal case study of metajournalistic discourse around the Center for Public Integrity, one of the oldest and largest news nonprofits in the United States, finds the Center engaging instead in what I have called boundary evolution, starting out self-consciously outside of journalism, and gradually working its way in. This insight helps us understand the power that marginal players wield in positioning themselves relative to larger participants. It also points to how players can evolve against the background of a changing ecology; in this case, the Center for Public Integrity came to see a place for itself in journalism only after funding cuts left news organizations hungry for quality, free content, and the digital environment normalized sharing.","[Konieczna, Magda] Temple Univ, Klein Coll, Dept Journalism, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA",,"Konieczna, M (corresponding author), Temple Univ, Klein Coll, Dept Journalism, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA.",magda@temple.edu,,"Konieczna, Magda/0000-0002-1597-8656",,,,,44,1,1,1,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

Through a multiplatform discourse analysis of the Leslie Jones attack, this paper examines the connections between platform vulnerabilities and the vulnerabilities of women of color, as well as the links between the rise of the alt-right and an increase in explicitly racist, misogynistic behaviors. Three key themes emerged from the analysis: messages of support and affirmation; the need for intervention; and the connection between this incident, systemic racism and sexism, and the rise of the alt-right. These themes serve as a bridge between the vulnerabilities of platforms and of women of color in those digital spaces and beyond. The supportive awareness campaigns and calls to action that issue publics launched online attempted to discursively patch' two perceived vulnerabilities - of Twitter as a platform and of Jones herself. However, in response to these patches,' members of the alt-right condemned Twitter and mainstream media for marginalizing their conservative voices, using this discourse to bolster their performance of victimization and oppression. Overall, this case study provides insight into the dynamics at work in the rise of the alt-right and online harassment, with particular attention to the significance of digital media, celebrity, and popular feminism in the ongoing political shifts in the United States.","[Lawson, Caitlin E.] Univ Michigan, Commun Studies, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",,"Lawson, CE (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Commun Studies, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",lawsonc@umich.edu,,"Lawson, Caitlin/0000-0001-8327-2172",,,,,71,22,22,3,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

The results indicate that self-identified conservatives doubt global warming in large part because of elite rhetoric, but that evolution beliefs are unrelated to reception of political discourse. News reception is perhaps the strongest predictor of conservatives' climate change skepticism, but has no influence on their aversion to evolution. Moreover, the article leverages three sources of variation in elite discourse on climate changetemporal, cross-national, and experimentalto show that changes in the prevalence of ideological cues strongly affect public opinion about global warming. Politically attentive conservatives, in fact, were more likely to believe scientists about global warming than liberals were in the 1990s before the media depicted climate change as a partisan issue. The United States is also the only nation where political interest significantly predicts both conservatives' skepticism about, and liberals' belief in, climate change. Finally, evidence from a national survey experiment suggests that Americans would be less skeptical of manmade global warming if more Republicans in Congress believed in it, but a growing Congressional consensus about evolution would not diminish doubts about its existence.","[Tesler, Michael] Univ Calif Irvine, Polit Sci, 3151 Social Sci Plaza, Irvine, CA 92697 USA",,"Tesler, M (corresponding author), Univ Calif Irvine, Polit Sci, 3151 Social Sci Plaza, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.",mtesler@uci.edu,,,,,,,54,44,44,3,31,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1058-4609,1091-7675,,POLIT COMMUN,Polit.

This paper explores whether these changes have weakened the basis of journalistic legitimacy, or have offered new grounds for journalistic legitimacy, and, in each case, to what extent. It is argued that a number of factors, including the financial difficulties of news media, the decentralisation of public communication as facilitated by the internet, the dual dilemmas faced by both objective and partisan journalism, and the belligerent public discourse about journalism are delegitimising journalism. However, the legitimatisation of journalism can be found in the efforts of news organisations-not only leading news organisations such as the Guardian and the New York Times but also regional and local ones such as the Trinity Mirror group and the Palm Beach Post-in adopting and possessing digital and technological tools and skills, and in defending their journalism. The relegitimation of journalism reiterates and reinforces the historically shaped essence of journalism that reflects a continuity of legacy journalism; and this is an organisational and occupational response to, and boundary defence against, the trend of delegitimation of journalism in the digital era.","[Tong, Jingrong] Brunel Univ London, Dept Social & Polit Sci, London, England",,"Tong, JR (corresponding author), Brunel Univ London, Dept Social & Polit Sci, London, England.",jingrong.tong@brunel.ac.uk,,,,,,,81,23,23,1,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

However, journalists have become frustrated with commenters who use forums to attack and make assertions. As journalists look for ways to reign in commenters, it becomes important to consider how journalists make decisions about moderation policies and practices. This study used gatekeeping theory to consider how one organization approached moderation and related issues of content management. The researcher conducted a one-month ethnography of a large news organization and their online forums and discovered that journalists set high expectations of commenters, but willingly accept low-quality content. Journalists appear to struggle with how to institute policies that promote high-quality discourse without engaging in intense battles with the audience and having to devote more resources to moderation. Journalists focus on establishing balance between allowing the audience to have a conversation without allowing that conversation to disrupt the traditional practices of journalism.","[Wolfgang, J.

Data also confirmed a positive correlation between charisma and the likelihood of reelection. I describe various trends in the data with respect to charisma and IC for time in office. Overall, findings show that using IC in leadership studies may be a worthwhile endeavor, as is measuring charisma by computer given that this measure correlated reasonably well with measures of charisma derived from other sources.","[Wasike, Ben] Univ Texas Rio Grande Valley, Dept Commun, Edinburg, TX USA",,"Wasike, B (corresponding author), One West Univ Blvd, Brownsville, TX 78520 USA.",Ben.wasike@utrgv.edu,"Wasike, Ben/V-3993-2019","Wasike, Ben/0000-0003-1652-9999",,,,,73,13,14,1,30,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1048-9843,1873-3409,,LEADERSHIP QUART,Leadersh.

They posit partisanship as a fundamentally democratic practice and develop a model of what partisans can do at their best to contribute to liberal democracy. However, the standards the literature puts forth remain insufficiently specified to serve as empirical benchmarks. This article further conceptualizes this model of democratic partisanship and offers a theoretical framework within which to empirically evaluate the democratic merits of partisan discourses. It establishes a series of indicators for assessing the extent to which partisan discourse displays two main qualities: cohesiveness and respect for political pluralism. The article then discusses the implications of using this theoretical framework as a basis for empirical studies and shows how the model can thereby benefit both political scientists and theorists.","[Herman, Lise Esther] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, London, England; [Herman, Lise Esther] Sci Po Paris, Polit Sci, 28 Rue St Peres, Paris, France",,"Herman, LE (corresponding author), London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, London, England.;Herman, LE (corresponding author), Sci Po Paris, Polit Sci, 28 Rue St Peres, Paris, France.",lise.herman@sciencespo.fr,,"Herman, Lise/0000-0001-9796-5922",,,,,117,11,11,0,14,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0003-0554,1537-5943,,AM POLIT SCI REV,Am.

In this study, 220 min of online Chinese courses were transcribed, with 17 Chinese learners and 5 native Chinese teachers as participants. Half of the transcribed data were drawn from students living in Taipei, Taiwan, a Chinese-speaking environment, learning Chinese as a second language. The other portion of the data was collected from students living in non-Chinese-speaking countries, learning Chinese as a foreign language with little exposure to the language outside the classroom. Analysis of the transcripts supported the hypothesis that the frequency of discourse markers used by individual speakers reflects their fluency in the target language. Further analyses of the function of discourse markers produced by the three participant groups suggested that understanding the ability to use discourse markers can be a valuable tool to evaluate, assess, and gauge richness of spoken content, as well as to aid in the development of teaching methods.","[Tsai, Pei-Shu] Natl Changhua Univ Educ, Grad Inst Translat & Interpretat, Changhua, Taiwan; [Chu, Wo-Hsin] Natl Taiwan Normal Univ, Dept Chinese Language 2, Taipei, Taiwan",,"Chu, WH (corresponding author), Natl Taiwan Normal Univ, Dept Chinese Language 2, Taipei, Taiwan.",chuwh@ntnu.edu.tw,"Tsai, Pei-Shu/AAP-2660-2020",,"Aim for the Top University Project of National Taiwan Normal University (NTNU); 'Center of Learning Technology for Chinese' of National Taiwan Normal University (NTNU); Ministry of Education, Taiwan, R.O.C.; 'International Research-Intensive Center of Excellence Program' of NTNU; Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan, R.O.C.

Languages vary by how much they require speakers to grammatically encode temporal differences. Futureless tongues (e.g., Estonian) do not oblige speakers to distinguish between the present and future tense, whereas futured tongues do (e.g., Russian). By grammatically conflating today and tomorrow, we hypothesize that speakers of futureless tongues will view the future as temporally closer to the present, causing them to discount the future less and support future-oriented policies more. Using an original survey experiment that randomly assigned the interview language to Estonian/Russian bilinguals, we find support for this proposition and document the absence of this language effect when a policy has no obvious time referent. We then replicate and extend our principal result through a cross-national analysis of survey data.

Two tasks were used as experimental tasks to gauge immediate planning effect on L2 production and the other two as new tasks to gauge L2 development. Results showed that both types of planning condition supported immediate production complexity but the ROP condition was more effective in leading to more accurate use of grammatical verb forms. With regard to the subsequent development of production complexity and accuracy, the ROP condition was more effective in leading to improvement on clausal complexity as well as control over the use of grammatical verb forms and avoidance of general errors.","[Hsu, Hsiu-Chen] Chung Yuan Christian Univ, Dept Appl Linguist & Language Studies, 200 Chung Pei Rd, Taoyuan 32023, Taiwan",,"Hsu, HC (corresponding author), Chung Yuan Christian Univ, Dept Appl Linguist & Language Studies, 200 Chung Pei Rd, Taoyuan 32023, Taiwan.",hsiuchen.hsu@cycu.edu.tw,"Hsu, Hsiu-Chen/AAT-1032-2020","Hsu, Hsiu-Chen/0000-0001-8114-074X",,,,,67,6,6,0,17,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0142-6001,1477-450X,,APPL LINGUIST,Appl.

In the classroom, L2 users are typically and primarily labeled 'learners', whereas beyond the classroom, 'in the wild' to borrow a term from Hutchins (1995), any aspect of their identity might take prominence (Firth and Wagner 1997). Drawing on data sets from classroom and non-classroom settings, this article shows two examples of the interactional work that goes into preparing for learning and how the ensuing learning/teaching activities are carried out. In both cases, participants co-construct learning/teaching spaces; the article shows how the two contexts call on different resources to accomplish this. Moreover, the actual learning sequences in interaction, framed around repair activities, are different in the two contexts; in the wild, the learning space is more condensed, embedded in the business-doing of the service encounter, whereas in class the activities are more extensive, the consequentiality is relaxed as speakers easily refer back to previous repair work and word searches, and they draw on writing and reading to an extent arguably rarely possible in non-classroom contexts.","[Eskildsen, Soren W.] Univ Southern Denmark, Dept Design & Commun, Odense, Denmark; [Theodorsdottir, Gudrun] Univ Iceland, Fac Iceland & Comparat Cultural Studies, Sch Humanities, Reykjavik, Iceland",,"Eskildsen, SW (corresponding author), Univ Southern Denmark, Dept Design & Commun, Odense, Denmark.;Theodorsdottir, G (corresponding author), Univ Iceland, Fac Iceland & Comparat Cultural Studies, Sch Humanities, Reykjavik, Iceland.",swe@sdu.dk; gt@hi.is,,"Eskildsen, Soren Wind/0000-0003-2432-9161",,,,,49,28,28,0,35,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0142-6001,1477-450X,,APPL LINGUIST,Appl.

Machiavelli demonstrates that, in particular, Giano della Bella and Michele di Lando could and should have attempted to imitate exemplary ancient founders and reformers whom he praises in previous works, especially Moses, Romulus, and Brutus. Machiavelli implicitly criticizes Giano and Michele for failing to spiritedly invigorate new laws with necessary and salutary violence; for neglecting to effectively manage the envy of rival peers; for not resisting the allure of middle ways between difficult political choices; and for failing to militarily organize or mobilize the entirety of Florence's common people.","[Mccormick, John P.] Univ Chicago, Polit Sci, 5828 So.

A few days later, on May 17, the Washington Post revealed that the Department of Justice had also been tracking the activities of Fox News' chief Washington correspondent, James Rosen. These two stories caused large scandals in the United States, and the majority of American journalists denounced the surveillance. As these scandals were still unfolding, yet another government surveillance scandal broke: former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden revealed that the federal government had been collecting the cell phone metadata of American citizens for several years. Journalists' responses to this scandal were more nuanced; editorials expressed a wider spectrum of views about the ethics of government surveillance practices, and more complex opinions about the legitimacy and necessity of government surveillance. Drawing on approaches to journalistic professionalism, this study uses qualitative textual analysis to assess editorials written in response to these three revelations. The analysis suggests that journalists see their speech as something deserving of unique protections, above and beyond those protections afforded to the general public.","[Johnson, Courtney N.] Univ Washington, Dept Commun, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",,"Johnson, CN (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Dept Commun, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",cnj3@uw.edu,,,,,,,40,2,2,1,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

Media should serve the public's need for information and offer various viewpoints and sources to enhance public debates. This study assesses how online surveillance is justified or countered in British broadcast news since the 2013 Snowden revelations for five selected major events in news coverage ending with the Charlie Hebdo aftermath in Paris in early 2015. The critical discourse analysis shows that UK broadcasts cover justification and delegitimation arguments of online surveillance. Online surveillance legitimation combines rationalisation (terror prevention) and moral evaluation (public security) arguments, which are often expressed by governmental actors. The broadcast discourse tends to give governmental, pro-surveillance actors a voice by default. The detailedness of terror threat descriptions increases over time. In 2013, ` terrorist attacks' are rather factually mentioned. In 2015, several ways leading to a loss of lives through terror are explicitly stated, which strengthens the instrumental rationality legitimation arguments. Delegitimising arguments predominantly use moralising and mythopoetic arguments (civil liberties) that are expressed by Snowden himself or politicians, yet rarely by non-governmental organisations, and very rarely by citizens. It is harder for non-governmental actors to continuously interpret the broadcast discourse. Therefore, what exactly is at stake when online mass surveillance increases remains obscure in the news discourse. The surveillance discourse should be richer in order to give the audience a chance to understand the vague and less tangible contra-surveillance arguments better.","[Lischka, Juliane A.] Univ Zurich, Inst Mass Commun & Media Res, Media Econ & Management Div, Zurich, Switzerland",,"Lischka, JA (corresponding author), Univ Zurich, Inst Mass Commun & Media Res, Andreasstr 15, CH-8050 Zurich, Switzerland.",j.lischka@ipmz.uzh.ch,,"Lischka, Juliane A./0000-0002-4845-0946",Economic and Social Research Council [ES/L01310X/1]; ESRC [ES/L01310X/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),This work was supported by the Economic and Social Research Council [grant number ES/L01310X/1].,,34,7,7,0,26,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

Using a data set of more than 3 million tweets about 2014 U.S. Senate candidates from three distinct groups-news media, political actors, and the public-we find that competitiveness and money spent in the race were the main predictors of volume of Twitter discourse, and the impact of competitiveness of the race was stronger for tweets coming from the media when compared to the other groups. Twitter volume did not predict vote share for any of the 35 races studied. Our findings suggest that Twitter is better understood as a tool for political communication, and its usage may be predicted by money spent and race characteristics. As an object, Twitter use has limited power to predict electoral outcomes.","[McGregor, Shannon C.] Univ Texas Austin, Sch Journalism, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [McGregor, Shannon C.] Univ Utah, Dept Commun, 255 Cent Campus Dr 2400, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA; [Mourao, Rachel R.] Michigan State Univ, Sch Journalism, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Molyneux, Logan] Temple Univ, Journalism, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA",,"McGregor, SC (corresponding author), Univ Utah, Dept Commun, 255 Cent Campus Dr 2400, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA.",shannon.c.mcgregor@gmail.com,"Molyneux, Logan/I-9791-2019; McGregor, Shannon C/AAO-1718-2020","Molyneux, Logan/0000-0001-7382-3065; Mourao, Rachel/0000-0001-8229-7247; McGregor, Shannon/0000-0002-3275-0397",,,,,57,30,30,0,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1933-1681,1933-169X,,J INF TECHNOL POLITI,J.

The Dutch are described as holding an indifferent stance towards privacy in the aftermath of Snowden's revelations of far-reaching government surveillance. But are Dutch reactions as aloof as often claimed? This study provides an in-depth overview of privacy attitudes in the Dutch debate about the National Security Agency (NSA) leaks, showing a greater variety of sentiments than anticipated. A qualitative frame analysis and a quantitative descriptive analysis resulted in six frames, which convey distinct privacy attitudes. Online and offline as well as professional and non-journalistic content in the debate displays a different distribution of frames. The frames, ranging from an End justifies the means attitude to an anxious fear of an Orwellian dystopia, are placed in a larger framework as the research demonstrates the connection to existing theories about privacy and surveillance. Dutch discussions about the NSA revelations often display a trade-off narrative balancing safety against privacy, and include (de)legitimisation strategies. These outcomes are in line with previous studies about mediated surveillance debates, which indicates that privacy attitudes transcend national boundaries. However, the inclusion of user-generated content adds an individual dimension to the existing body of research and reveals a personal perspective on surveillance issues.","[Mols, Anouk; Janssen, Susanne] Erasmus Univ, Dept Media & Commun, Erasmus Sch Hist Culture & Commun, Rotterdam, Netherlands",,"Mols, A (corresponding author), Erasmus Univ, Dept Media & Commun, Erasmus Sch Hist Culture & Commun, Rotterdam, Netherlands.",mols@eshcc.eur.nl; s.janssen@eshcc.eur.nl,"Janssen, Susanne/C-7438-2011","Janssen, Susanne/0000-0002-8984-3498; Mols, Anouk/0000-0003-0355-9849",,,,,54,7,7,0,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

Drawing on theories from social psychology, I outline and test a set of theoretical predictions to explore this relationship in the context of Spanish-language political ads. The results suggest that Spanish-language political ads do, in fact, increase perceptions of collective political power among Latinos, but not in a way that unequivocally promote perceptions of political homogeneity.

Algorithmic techniques specify principles and methods for doing things in the medium of software and they thus constitute units of knowledge and expertise in the domain of software making. I suggest that algorithmic techniques are a suitable object of study for the humanities and social science since they capture the central technical principles behind actual software, but can generally be described in accessible language. To make my case, I focus on the field of information ordering and, first, discuss the wider historical trajectory of formal or 'mechanical' reasoning applied to matters of commerce and government before, second, moving to the investigation of a particular algorithmic technique, the Bayes classifier. This technique is explicated through a reading of the original work of M. E. Maron in the early 1960 and presented as a means to subject empirical, 'datafied' reality to an interested reading that confers meaning to each variable in relation to an operational goal. After a discussion of the Bayes classifier in relation to the question of power, the paper concludes by coming back to its initial motive and argues for increased attention to algorithmic techniques in the study of software.","[Rieder, Bernhard] Univ Amsterdam, Mediastudies Dept, New Media & Digital Culture, Amsterdam, Netherlands",,"Rieder, B (corresponding author), Univ Amsterdam, Mediastudies Dept, Turfdraagsterpad 9, NL-1012 TX Amsterdam, Netherlands.",rieder@uva.nl,"Rieder, Bernhard/D-2535-2014","Rieder, Bernhard/0000-0002-2404-9277",,,,,49,25,25,1,26,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

A survey-experiment with a quota sample of 471 participants reveals that, overall, symbolic threat appeals exert stronger effects on anti-immigrant attitudes than economic ones. When presented via text alone, only symbolicnot economicthreat appeals increased anti-immigrant attitudes via the activation of heuristic processing such as the reliance on negative stereotypes or feelings of anxiety, in particular among lower-educated citizens. When visuals were present, both types of threat appeals enhanced anti-immigrant attitudes among citizens across all education levels based on heuristic processing. Additionally, high image-text congruency induced cognitive argument approval resulting in higher anti-immigrant attitudes.","[Schmuck, Desiree; Matthes, Joerg] Univ Vienna, Dept Commun, Advertising Res, Vienna, Austria",,"Schmuck, D (corresponding author), Univ Vienna, Advertising & Media Effects Res Grp, Wahringerstr 29, A-1090 Vienna, Austria.",desiree.schmuck@univie.ac.at,"Schmuck, Desiree/AAA-5465-2021; Matthes, Jorg/B-5598-2009","Schmuck, Desiree/0000-0002-9492-6052; Matthes, Jorg/0000-0001-9408-955X",,,,,54,45,46,2,34,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1058-4609,1091-7675,,POLIT COMMUN,Polit.

Responses from 74 deaf people across 14 European member states confirm that deaf people want to see such a service, and would be willing to use it in order to make contact with European institutions.

A close reading of the two campaigns with a special focus on organizers' and participants' choice of frames, narratives, and iconography reveals how privacy activists have tried to exploit the political opportunity structures of the Snowden leaks and receive media attention. Through the use of historical, cultural, and global framing devices, as well as a particular focus on the actions of individual celebrity activists, organizers have sought to mobilize the public against surveillance. As a thorough look at the subsequent media coverage of the campaigns reveals, the framing activities opened discursive spaces in the contemporary debate about the effects and consequences of mass surveillance. Thus, these two case studies offer important insights both into the grassroots political communication tactics of privacy advocates and the representation of anti-surveillance sentiments in the mainstream media.","[Waescher, Till] TU Dortmund Univ, SIIC, Dortmund, Germany",,"Wascher, T (corresponding author), TU Dortmund Univ, SIIC, Dortmund, Germany.",till.waescher@medienpolitik.eu,,,MERCUR Program of the Mercator Research Center Ruhr Foundation; German Academic Exchange Service,MERCUR Program of the Mercator Research Center Ruhr Foundation; German Academic Exchange Service(Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD)),"Research for this article has been supported by the MERCUR Program of the Mercator Research Center Ruhr Foundation.

They prefer to act in accordance with the political conception of justice, but only if they are assured that others will. On Paul Weithman's influential interpretation, Rawls attempts to solve this problem by claiming that public reason is an assurance mechanism. There are several problems with Rawls's solution: Public reason talk is too cheap to facilitate assurance, it is difficult to know when particular utterances express public reasons, and the requirements of public reason conflict with the fact of reasonable pluralism. We argue that convergence discourse-not public reason-solves the assurance problem by being a costly signal that indicates commitment to the political conception. This solution has none of Rawls's problems and has an interesting corollary: As diversity increases in society, so too does society's ability to solve the assurance problem.

This article innovates, first, by examining an unusually broad set of measures (from the 2004 GSS) tapping national identification, ethnocultural and civic criteria for national membership, domain-specific national pride, and invidious comparisons to other nations, thus providing a fuller depiction of Americans' national self-understanding. Second, we use latent class analysis to explore heterogeneity, partitioning the sample into classes characterized by distinctive patterns of attitudes. Conventional distinctions between ethnocultural and civic nationalism describe just about half of the U.S. population and do not account for the unexpectedly low levels of national pride found among respondents who hold restrictive definitions of American nationhood. A subset of primarily younger and well-educated Americans lacks any strong form of patriotic sentiment; a larger class, primarily older and less well educated, embraces every form of nationalist sentiment. Controlling for sociodemographic characteristics and partisan identification, these classes vary significantly in attitudes toward ethnic minorities, immigration, and national sovereignty. Finally, using comparable data from 1996 and 2012, we find structural continuity and distributional change in national sentiments over a period marked by terrorist attacks, war, economic crisis, and political contention.","[Bonikowski, Bart] Harvard Univ, Sociol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [DiMaggio, Paul] NYU, Sociol, New York, NY 10003 USA",,"Bonikowski, B (corresponding author), Harvard Univ, Dept Sociol, 636 William James Hall, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",bonikowski@fas.harvard.edu,,,Russell Sage Foundation,Russell Sage Foundation,The research was supported by a grant from the Russell Sage Foundation.,,90,126,127,16,96,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0003-1224,1939-8271,,AM SOCIOL REV,Am.

To answer these questions, we analyze the legislative histories of hundreds of threatened and unthreatened riders from 1985 through 2008. We find that threats are effective in bringing the final legislation closer to the president's preferences. Threats achieve their success, in large part, by interrupting the textbook legislative process in the Senate-spawning filibusters, prompting leaders to punt bills to conference, and encouraging the use of other unorthodox procedures. Unlike conventional models that regard veto threats as minimally effective, the findings presented here depict veto rhetoric as integral to identifying critical riders separating the legislative parties that must be resolved in order to avoid gridlock and pass annual appropriations legislation.","[Hassell, Hans J.

Arguing that hegemony operates around producer-provider norms of masculinity and through tropes of blackness within a system of racial capitalism, I show how complicity underscores the reality of differential aspirational models in the context of severe un- and underemployment and the failure of the classic breadwinner model for black men globally. I draw on participant observation fieldwork and interviews with men from Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire's informal sector from 2008 to 2009. I investigate two groups of men: political propagandists (orators) for former President Laurent Gbagbo and mobile street vendors. Rejecting racialized colonial narratives that positioned salaried workers as evolved, orators used anti-French rhetoric and ties to the political regime to pursue entrepreneurial identities. Vendors, positioned as illegitimate workers and non-citizens, asserted consumerist models of masculinity from global black popular culture. I show how entrepreneurialism and consumerism, the two paradigmatic neoliberal identities, have become ways for black men to assert economic participation as alternatives to the producer-provider ideal.","[Matlon, Jordanna] Amer Univ, Sch Int Serv, 4400 Massachussetts Ave NW, Washington, DC 20016 USA",,"Matlon, J (corresponding author), Amer Univ, Sch Int Serv, 4400 Massachussetts Ave NW, Washington, DC 20016 USA.",jcmatlon@american.edu,,,U.S. Department of Education; National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship; UC-Berkeley Fall Research Grant; UC-Berkeley Institute of International Studies Simpson Award; UC Dissertation-Year Fellowship; Agence Nationale de la Recherche-Labex IAST,U.S. Department of Education(US Department of Education); National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship(National Science Foundation (NSF)); UC-Berkeley Fall Research Grant; UC-Berkeley Institute of International Studies Simpson Award; UC Dissertation-Year Fellowship; Agence Nationale de la Recherche-Labex IAST(French National Research Agency (ANR)),"This research was completed with the generous support of the U.S. Department of Education Jacob K.

Yet, the detrimental effects of this trend have been more assumed than demonstrated. This study examines one consequence of sound-bite journalism: the creation of incomplete argument, in which speakers presenting their political position in the news do not also justify it. Drawing on data about television news in Germany, Russia, and the United States, it shows that shrinking sound bites consistently reduce the probability of opinion justification across widely differing national contexts. Sound-bite journalism emerges as harmful to television news' ability to produce public justification.","[Rinke, Eike Mark] Univ Mannheim, Mannheim Ctr European Social Res MZES, D-68131 Mannheim, Germany",,"Rinke, EM (corresponding author), Univ Mannheim, Mannheim Ctr European Social Res MZES, D-68131 Mannheim, Germany.",rinke@uni-mannheim.de,,"Rinke, Eike Mark/0000-0002-5330-7634",,,,,58,5,5,0,20,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0021-9916,1460-2466,,J COMMUN,J.

While it is generally accepted that there are value differences between Democrats and Republicans, the extent to which these differences are reflected in word usage has been theorized but is largely untested. The connection between values and language is, theoretically, not limited just to politicians, but should be especially evident among politicians as representatives of existing ideological poles. In this article, we examine elite rhetoric through the lens of four value-centered theoretical frameworks (Lakoff's Parenting Styles model, Moral Foundations Theory, Schwartz's Values Theory, and Motivated Social Cognition Theory). Contrary to the expectations posited by these four theories, we find little reliable evidence of value-related language differences between Democratic and Republican politicians. Our findings suggest that, at least when it comes to elite rhetoric, widely accepted theoretical claims about the value-based nature of political language and political differences are not consistently supported by empirical analysis.","[Neiman, Jayme L.] Univ No Iowa, Dept Polit Sci, 358 Sabin Hall, Cedar Falls, IA 50614 USA; [Gonzalez, Frank J.; Wilkinson, Kevin; Smith, Kevin B.; Hibbing, John R.] Univ Nebraska, Dept Polit Sci, Lincoln, NE USA",,"Neiman, JL (corresponding author), Univ No Iowa, Dept Polit Sci, 358 Sabin Hall, Cedar Falls, IA 50614 USA.",jayme.neiman@uni.edu,"Gonzalez, Frank J./Y-5135-2019","Gonzalez, Frank J./0000-0002-1953-5764",,,,,42,19,19,0,17,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1058-4609,1091-7675,,POLIT COMMUN,Polit.

The present study addresses the use of imperatives in a corpus of upper-level A-graded student papers from 16 disciplines. A total of 822 papers collected within the past 5 years were analyzed for imperative use, with particular emphasis placed on the main text of papers from the five disciplines with the highest proportion of imperatives. In each of these disciplines, text-based interviews were conducted with faculty members to establish disciplinary contexts. Results show that imperatives are used frequently in physics, philosophy, economics, mechanical engineering, and linguistics, though in quite varying ways. The interview data suggest that successful and experienced student writers adopt the potentially 'high risk strategy' (Hyland 2012) of initiating a sentence with an imperative for various strategic purposes that are discipline-specific.

This study shows that French and German speakers employ the same phonetic contrast to indicate the nature of that turn continuation. In spite of the typological difference between the German use of glottalization and the French use of linking phenomena for word boundaries involving word-initial vowels, speakers of both languages exploit this contrast systematically in their design of multiunit turns. Initial confirmations are joined directly to subsequent vowel-fronted turn components when speakers respond with an internally cohesive multiunit confirming turn. The components are separated by glottalization when responses involve multiple actions or departures from a trajectory projected by the turn-initial confirmation. This is further evidence that sound patterns shape interaction and are not solely determined by language-specific phonologies.

The participants were enrolled in a bilingual secondary educational program. They performed two narrative tasks in speech and writing. The participants' level of anxiety was assessed using the IPOA scale (MacIntyre and Gardner 1994). The results demonstrate that spoken and written modalities are influenced differently by anxiety with the impact of output anxiety being significantly stronger in speech than in writing. Another important finding was that input and processing anxiety had both facilitating and debilitating effects on learners' L2 output. As regards the effect of task complexity on participants' narratives, the findings suggest that the different stages of language production need to be taken into account when categorizing tasks on the basis of the cognitive load they impose on learners.","[Trebits, Anna] Leuphana Univ Luneburg, ZeMoS, Luneburg, Germany; [Trebits, Anna] Eotvos Lorand Univ, Dept Language Pedag, Sch English & Amer Studies, H-1364 Budapest, Hungary",,"Trebits, A (corresponding author), Leuphana Univ Luneburg, ZeMoS, Luneburg, Germany.;Trebits, A (corresponding author), Eotvos Lorand Univ, Dept Language Pedag, Sch English & Amer Studies, H-1364 Budapest, Hungary.",trebits@leuphana.de,,,,,,,45,5,5,5,52,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0142-6001,1477-450X,,APPL LINGUIST,Appl.

J,"Grant, T; Macleod, N",,,,"Grant, Tim; Macleod, Nicci",,,Assuming Identities Online: Experimental Linguistics Applied to the Policing of Online Paedophile Activity,APPLIED LINGUISTICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"This article uses a research project into the online conversations of sex offenders and the children they abuse to further the arguments for the acceptability of experimental work as a research tool for linguists. The research reported here contributes to the growing body of work within linguistics that has found experimental methods to be useful in answering questions about representation and constraints on linguistic expression (Hemforth 2013). The wider project examines online identity assumption in online paedophile activity and the policing of such activity, and involves dealing with the linguistic analysis of highly sensitive sexual grooming transcripts. Within the linguistics portion of the project, we examine theories of idiolect and identity through analysis of the 'talk' of perpetrators of online sexual abuse, and of the undercover officers that must assume alternative identities in order to investigate such crimes. The essential linguistic question in this article is methodological and concerns the applicability of experimental work to exploration of online identity and identity disguise. Although we touch on empirical questions, such as the sufficiency of linguistic description that will enable convincing identity disguise, we do not explore the experimental results in detail. In spite of the preference within a range of discourse analytical paradigms for 'naturally occurring' data, we argue that not only does the term prove conceptually problematic, but in certain contexts, and particularly in the applied forensic context described, a rejection of experimentally elicited data would limit the possible types and extent of analyses. Thus, it would restrict the contribution that academic linguistics can make in addressing a serious social problem.","[Grant, Tim; Macleod, Nicci] Aston Univ, Ctr Forens Linguist, Birmingham B4 7ET, W Midlands, England",,"Macleod, N (corresponding author), Aston Univ, Ctr Forens Linguist, Birmingham B4 7ET, W Midlands, England.",n.macleod1@aston.ac.uk,"MacLeod, Nicci/AAC-3051-2020","MacLeod, Nicci/0000-0002-6642-5509",Economic and Social Research Council [ES/L003279/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/L003279/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,58,15,15,3,44,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0142-6001,1477-450X,,APPL LINGUIST,Appl.

French Muslim Women, Foucault, and The Full Veil Ban",AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,,DISCOURSE; FRANCE; ISLAM,"This article proposes a conception of freedom understood as practices. Based on Michel Foucault's work on the ethics of the self, I develop a conception of freedom that exceeds liberation and distinguishes between genuine practices of freedom and practices of the self that are unreflective responses to systems of government. I develop and illustrate this conception through an engagement with the recent French ban on full veils in public spaces and the ethnographic literature on European Muslim revival movements. I reconstruct how Muslim women relate to alternative discourses through specific practices of the self. These practices reveal that French Muslim women actively contest discourses of secularism and liberation that construct them as inherently passive and in need of tutelage. The conception I develop sheds light on some shortcomings of Philip Pettit's notion of freedom as nondomination. I argue that the proposed account is useful to, first, criticize the centrality of the opposition between arbitrary and nonarbitrary power in the definition of freedom. Second, I show that the predominant engagement with the external dimension of freedom in Pettit makes it difficult to capture the particular subjective practices that make up freedom and its development in the presence of power and/or attempts at domination.","[Valdez, Ines] Ohio State Univ, 154 N Oval Mall,2140 Derby Hall, Columbus, OH 43210 USA",,"Valdez, I (corresponding author), Ohio State Univ, 154 N Oval Mall,2140 Derby Hall, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.",inevaldez@gmail.com,"Valdez, Inés/AAH-8008-2021","Valdez, Inés/0000-0002-8834-809X",,,,,81,10,10,0,16,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0003-0554,1537-5943,,AM POLIT SCI REV,Am.

Drawing on a digital ethnography of Silk Road, we develop the notion of constructive activism to extend the lexicon of concepts available to discuss forms of online activism. Monitoring of the cryptomarket took place between June 2011 and its closure in October 2013. Just before and after the closure of the marketplace we conducted anonymous online interviews with 17 people who reported buying drugs on Silk Road (1.0). These interviews were conducted synchronously and interactively through encrypted instant messaging. Participants discussed harnessing and developing the technological tools needed to access Silk Road and engage within the Silk Road community. For participants Silk Road was not just a market for trading drugs: it facilitated a shared experience of personal freedom within a libertarian philosophical framework, where open discussions about stigmatized behaviours were encouraged and supported. Tensions between public activism against drug prohibition and the need to hide one's identity as a drug user from public scrutiny were partially resolved through community actions that internalized these politics, rather than engaging in forms of online activism that are intended to have real-world political effects. Most aptly described through van de Sande's (2015) concept of prefigurative politics, they sought to transform their values into built environments that were designed to socially engineer a more permissive digital reality, which we refer to as constructive activism.","[Maddox, Alexia; Barratt, Monica J.; Lenton, Simon] Curtin Univ, Natl Drug Res Inst, Fac Hlth Sci, Perth, WA 6845, Australia; [Barratt, Monica J.] UNSW, Drug Policy Modelling Program, Natl Drug & Alcohol Res Ctr, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Barratt, Monica J.] Burnet Inst, Ctr Populat Hlth, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Allen, Matthew] Deakin Univ, Sch Commun & Creat Arts, Geelong, Vic 3217, Australia",,"Maddox, A (corresponding author), Curtin Univ, Natl Drug Res Inst, Fac Hlth Sci, Perth, WA 6845, Australia.",a.maddox@deakin.edu.au; m.barratt@unsw.edu.au; matthew.allen@deakin.edu.au; S.Lenton@curtin.edu.au,"Maddox, Alexia/A-1564-2016; Lenton, Simon R/I-4690-2013; Allen, Matthew/K-6765-2015; Barratt, Monica J/AAX-8698-2020","Maddox, Alexia/0000-0002-5618-5476; Lenton, Simon R/0000-0002-7013-9812; Allen, Matthew/0000-0002-8882-8763; Barratt, Monica J/0000-0002-1015-9379",National Drug Research Institute; Australian Government under the Substance Misuse Prevention and Service Improvement Grants Fund; National Health & Medical Research Council Early Career Researcher Fellowship [APP1070140],National Drug Research Institute; Australian Government under the Substance Misuse Prevention and Service Improvement Grants Fund(Australian Government); National Health & Medical Research Council Early Career Researcher Fellowship,"The project was supported by internal funding from the National Drug Research Institute.

On issues that are strictly censored, immigrants exposed to Western reports became more critical of their home government's performance and decreased their trust in official discourse.

Federal Elections Commission (FEC) decision opens the door to an important question: Did the degree to which media corporations benefited from the changes in campaign finance law influence their news outlets' coverage of the Citizens United decision? In other words, is it possible to identify variation in how media outlets covered the Supreme Court decision that correlates with the degree to which those outlets' parent companies profited from the resulting increase in campaign spending? Answering this question will provide an important and much-too-uncommon opportunity to systematically test for bias in news coverage. Replicating the method used by Gilens and Hertzman (2000) in their own test of coverage of the 1996 Telecommunications Act, this analysis reveals that newspapers belonging to media corporations that own more television stations covered the Citizens United ruling systematically differentlyand more favorablythan those with few or no television stations. This has important implications for the degree to which the news produced by increasingly conglomerated and corporatized media companies may eschew neutral or balanced coverage in favor of news frames that promote their own financial interests.","[Bailard, Catie Snow] George Washington Univ, Sch Media & Publ Affairs, 805 21st St NW,Suite 400, Washington, DC 20052 USA",,"Bailard, CS (corresponding author), George Washington Univ, Sch Media & Publ Affairs, 805 21st St NW,Suite 400, Washington, DC 20052 USA.",cbailard@gwu.edu,,,,,,,37,6,6,0,21,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1058-4609,1091-7675,,POLIT COMMUN,Polit.

Integrating insights from work on banal and everyday nationalism, collective rituals, national identity, and commemorative struggles with survey-based findings from political psychology, I demonstrate that meanings attached to the nation vary within and across populations as well as over time, with important implications for microinteraction and for political beliefs and behavior, including support for exclusionary policies and authoritarian politics. I conclude by suggesting how new developments in methods of data collection and analysis can inform future research on this topic.","[Bonikowski, Bart] Harvard Univ, Dept Sociol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",,"Bonikowski, B (corresponding author), Harvard Univ, Dept Sociol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",bonikowski@fas.harvard.edu,,,,,,,157,123,124,11,76,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",0360-0572,,978-0-8243-2242-7,ANNU REV SOCIOL,Annu.

Using data on new-investor recruitment into Kenya's nascent capital market, the Nairobi Securities Exchange, from 2005 through 2008, I identified mechanisms driving social segmentation as well as integration of disparate groups. The empirical context is characterized by weak formal institutions and high levels of inter-ethnic distrust, a novel but productive setting for studying how potential adopters use social identities to resolve uncertainty around expected gains of participating in a new market. Results show that instead of exhibiting blanket influence by homophilous peers, potential investors were positively influenced by profits earned by proximate coethnic peers primarily when their own exposure to corrupt financial organizations was higher but were negatively influenced by the profits of ethnic outsiders when the market was identified with distrusted political rivals. Several mechanisms moderated this pattern of distrust, including inter-ethnic residential and religious integration but especially the use of national language rather than ethnic language advertising campaigns, which reframed the market as a shared social identity. Findings indicate that the negative effects of social segmentation, including the distorting influences of dissimilar peers and environmental factors such as political tensions and distrust in institutions, can be reversed when potential investors learn about new market opportunities from neutral third parties or when policy makers frame such practices in socially neutral language.","Univ Chicago, Booth Sch Business, Chicago, IL 60637 USA",,"Yenkey, CB (corresponding author), Univ Chicago, Booth Sch Business, 5807 S Woodlawn Ave, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",cyenkey@chicagobooth.edu,,,National Science Foundation [0802469]; Cornell University's Center for the Study of Economy and Society; Einaudi Center for International Studies; Center for the Study of Inequality; Graduate School International Research Fund; Initiative on Global Markets at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business,National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Cornell University's Center for the Study of Economy and Society; Einaudi Center for International Studies; Center for the Study of Inequality; Graduate School International Research Fund; Initiative on Global Markets at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business,"This project would not have been possible without data access provided by Rose Mambo and James Gikonyo at the CDSC or Cornell University's willingness to protect it.

Fact-checking has come to play an increasingly important role in political coverage in the United States, but some research suggests it may be ineffective at reducing public misperceptions about controversial issues. However, fact-checking might instead help improve political discourse by increasing the reputational costs or risks of spreading misinformation for political elites. To evaluate this deterrent hypothesis, we conducted a field experiment on a diverse group of state legislators from nine U.S. states in the months before the November 2012 election. In the experiment, a randomly assigned subset of state legislators was sent a series of letters about the risks to their reputation and electoral security if they were caught making questionable statements. The legislators who were sent these letters were substantially less likely to receive a negative fact-checking rating or to have their accuracy questioned publicly, suggesting that fact-checking can reduce inaccuracy when it poses a salient threat.","[Nyhan, Brendan] Dartmouth Coll, Dept Govt, Hanover, NH 03755 USA; [Reifler, Jason] Univ Exeter, Dept Polit, Polit, Exeter EX4 4RJ, Devon, England",,"Nyhan, B (corresponding author), Dartmouth Coll, Dept Govt, 305 Silsby Hall,HB 6108, Hanover, NH 03755 USA.",nyhan@dartmouth.edu; j.reifler@exeter.ac.uk,,"Reifler, Jason/0000-0002-1116-7346",Democracy Fund; New America Foundation,Democracy Fund; New America Foundation,"Funding support was provided by the Democracy Fund and New America Foundation.

The findings reveal that ideology is a significant determinant of vote choice in Latin America. They also suggest that the success of leftist leaders at the polls reflects the views of the voters sustaining their victories. The location of parties and leaders reveals that three distinctive clusters exist: one located at the left of the political spectrum, another at the center, and a third on the right. The results also indicate that legislators in Brazil, Mexico, and Peru tend to be more leftists than their voters. The ideological drift, however, is not significant enough to substantiate the view that a disconnect between voters and politicians lies behind the success of leftist presidents in these countries. These findings highlight the importance of using a common-space scale to compare disparate populations and call into question a number of recent studies by scholars of Latin American politics who fail to adequately address this important issue.","Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Polit Sci, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA",,"Saiegh, SM (corresponding author), Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Polit Sci, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",ssaiegh@ucsd.edu,,,,,,,65,31,35,0,0,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1047-1987,1476-4989,,POLIT ANAL,Polit.

We offer a framework that accounts for this discrepancy. Using two priming experiments conducted among American Catholics, Turkish Muslims, and Israeli Jews, we disentangle the role of religious social identity and religious belief, and differentiate among types of immigrants based on their ethnic and religious similarity to, or difference from, members of the host society. We find that religious social identity increases opposition to immigrants who are dissimilar to in-group members in religion or ethnicity, while religious belief engenders welcoming attitudes toward immigrants of the same religion and ethnicity, particularly among the less conservative devout. These results suggest that different elements of the religious experience exert distinct and even contrasting effects on immigration attitudes, manifested in both the citizenry's considerations of beliefs and identity and its sensitivity to cues regarding the religion of the target group.","[Bloom, Pazit Ben-Nun] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Polit Sci, Jerusalem, Israel; [Arikan, Gizem] Yasar Univ, Dept Int Relat, Izmir, Turkey; [Courtemanche, Marie] Thiel Coll, Dept Polit Sci, Greenville, PA USA",,"Bloom, PB (corresponding author), Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Polit Sci, Jerusalem, Israel.",pazit.bennun@mail.huji.ac.il; gizem.arikan@yasar.edu.tr; mcourtemanche@thiel.edu,"Arikan, Gizem/AAK-9573-2020","Arikan, Gizem/0000-0002-2083-7321; Ben-Nun Bloom, Pazit/0000-0003-4930-3355",Israel Science Foundation (ISF) [676/13],Israel Science Foundation (ISF)(Israel Science Foundation),"For invaluable advice and support at different stages of the project, we are grateful to Gadi Bloom, Amnon Cavari, Jack Citrin, Emre Erdogan, Ted Jelen, David Sears, Eser Sekercioglu, the journal's editors, and four anonymous reviewers, as well as participants at the 2013 annual meetings of the Midwest Political Science Association, the International Society of Political Psychology, the Israel Political Science Association, and the 2014 Religion, Democracy and Law International Conference in London Metropolitan University.

Based on a linguistic ethnography, this article presents some of these neglected perspectives on English for development at a private and unreformed Qawmi madrasa in rural Bangladesh. The findings show that people in the madrasa from a reflexively traditional stance, reject economic progress and western development programmes, and largely resist English as a language of development.

For children with severe speech impairment (SSI) who have little or no intelligible speech, active participation in conversations is challenging and can be critical for their social inclusion and participation. The present study investigated the conversational patterns emerging from interactions between children with SSI who use aided communication and typically speaking conversation partners (CPs) and explored whether active participation was different in interactions with different numbers of partners (dyadic versus multi-person interactions). An unusually large multilingual dataset was used (N= 85 conversations). This allowed us to systematically investigate discourse analysis measures indicating participation: the distribution of conversational control (initiations versus responses versus recodes) and summoning power (obliges versus comments). The findings suggest that (i) conversations were characterized by asymmetrical conversational patterns with CPs assuming most of the conversational control and (ii) multi-person interactions were noticeably more symmetric compared to dyadic, as children's active participation in multi-person interactions was significantly increased.

They create opportunities for new entrants from the margins to enter professional fields in need of revamping. Using information and communication sciences research on policy and organizations and on the interplay between agency, platforms and networks, this analysis focuses on three main criteria for evaluating the field-configuring role of disinformation: policy rules and professional canons (to regain some lost political and economic ground), key events and projects (to provide sense-making strategies), and interactions with audiences and communities (to restore trust and reputation). Focusing on the European Union as main terrain of analysis due to its pioneering initiatives, this analysis first considers the mutual benefits afforded by the fight against disinformation. Then considers three main challenges: MIL risks being reduced to news literacy, digital journalism risks being reduced to fact-checking, and the disinformation discourse risks downscaling the emphasis on information.

However, these insights are mainly based on studies of minoritized learners of English as a second language. Drawing on a one-year ethnographic study conducted in six Palestinian schools in Northern Israel, the present study investigated the effects of translanguaging in a conflict-ridden context, where both the teachers and the learners are minoritized and English is learned as a foreign language. Drawing upon concept of implicit censorship and linguistic citizenship, we propose colonized education as a framework for understanding the tensions between translanguaging, as a decolonial pedagogy, and English language learning. Our findings suggest that while translanguaging may indeed have a liberatory force, it could also, at the same time, take an emotional-pedagogic toll that may hinder language learning rather than support it. In contrast, critical discussions of issues that are politically and emotionally laden may be highly effective, even when conducted in the target language.","[Awayed-Bishara, Muzna; Netz, Hadar] Tel Aviv Univ, Sch Educ, Tel Aviv, Israel; [Milani, Tommaso] Univ Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Vastra Gotaland, Sweden",,"Awayed-Bishara, M (corresponding author), Tel Aviv Univ, Sch Educ, Tel Aviv, Israel.",muznabishara@gmail.com; hadar.netz@gmail.com; tommaso.milani@svenska.gu.se,,,Israel Science Foundation [89/489],Israel Science Foundation(Israel Science Foundation),This researh was supported by the Israel Science Foundation (grant No. 89/489).,,47,0,0,5,5,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0142-6001,1477-450X,,APPL LINGUIST,Appl.

It asks whether, in the context of online forums, groups with more exclusionary language in their rules statements will generate more uncivil comments, and whether political orientation of the most exclusive forums will affect incivility in comments. Sidebar data and one month's worth of comments spanning between June and July of 2020 (n = 4,413,646) were collected from 71 political forums on Reddit. A sample of these comments was analyzed using Google's Perspective API to assess their toxic incivility. Fitting a multilevel regression model that respects the hierarchical structure of the data shows no significant association between inclusivity and incivility. However, depth of the comment in the reply structure and length of the comment were found to be significant predictors of toxic incivility when controlling for political alignment of the subreddit, with comments at a deeper level being, on average, slightly less toxic. In addition, toxic incivility was found to be associated with an increase in a comment's upvotes. These results suggest that toxic incivility varies significantly between and within subreddits, submissions, and top-level comments, and that inclusionary language is not a reliable predictor of toxic incivility.","[Hansen, Russell W.] Univ Washington, Dept Commun, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",,"Hansen, RW (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Dept Commun, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",hanser2@uw.edu,,"Hansen, Russell/0000-0001-5044-5815",,,,,43,0,0,1,1,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1933-1681,1933-169X,,J INF TECHNOL POLITI,J.

Yet, if women are more likely than men to be interrupted during committee work, they may face a gender-related impediment. We examine speech patterns during more than 24,000 congressional committee hearings from 1994 to 2018 to determine whether women Members are more likely to be interrupted than men. We find that they are. This is especially true in Senate committees-where women are about 10% more likely to be interrupted. Furthermore, in hearings that discuss women's issues, women are more than twice as likely to be interrupted than while discussing other issues. We see a similar pattern for rapid-fire interruption clusters, an aggressive form of interruption. We further consider a range of moderating factors, which yields little evidence that women change their communication strategy as they gain experience in Congress. We also find suggestive evidence that interruptions are driven by mixed-gender interactions.","[Miller, Michael G.] Columbia Univ, Barnard Coll, Dept Polit Sci, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Sutherland, Joseph L.] Emory Univ, Dept Quantitat Theory & Methods, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA",,"Miller, MG (corresponding author), Columbia Univ, Barnard Coll, Dept Polit Sci, New York, NY 10027 USA.",mgmiller@barnard.edu; jls2316@columbia.edu,,"Miller, Michael/0000-0001-5615-9828",,,,,68,0,0,1,1,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0003-0554,1537-5943,,AM POLIT SCI REV,Am.

As such, many practitioners include multiple factualor instructional closed-ended manipulation checks to identify low-attention respondents. However, closed-ended manipulation checks are either correct or incorrect, which allows participants to more easily guess and it reduces the potential variation in attention between respondents. In response to these shortcomings, I develop an automatic and standardized methodology to measure attention that relies on the text that respondents provide in an open-ended manipulation check. There are multiple benefits to this approach. First, it provides a continuous measure of attention, which allows for greater variation between respondents. Second, it reduces the reliance on subjective, paid humans to analyze open-ended responses. Last, I outline how to diagnose the impact of inattentive workers on the overall results, including how to assess the average treatment effect of those respondents that likely received the treatment. I provide easy-to-use software in R to implement these suggestions for open-ended manipulation checks.","[Ziegler, Jeffrey] Emory Univ, Inst Quantitat Theory & Methods, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; [Ziegler, Jeffrey] Trinity Coll Dublin, Dept Polit Sci, Dublin, Ireland",,"Ziegler, J (corresponding author), Emory Univ, Inst Quantitat Theory & Methods, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA.;Ziegler, J (corresponding author), Trinity Coll Dublin, Dept Polit Sci, Dublin, Ireland.",zieglerj@tcd.ie,,"Ziegler, Jeffrey/0000-0003-3905-7488",,,,,19,1,1,1,1,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1047-1987,1476-4989,,POLIT ANAL,Polit.

Seventy-five Catalan learners of French participated in three training sessions with short dialogues, in one of three conditions: speech-only, non-embodied logatome, and embodied logatome. Before and after the training period, participants carried out an identical pre- and posttest which consisted of reading four dialogues aloud.

Fifty learners completed a background questionnaire, an elicited imitation task, and the contextualized preference task. Learners' preference for a deleted variant tended to increase as proficiency level increased, as did sensitivity to variables previously shown to constrain native speaker patterns of variation, including speaker gender, surrounding phonetic context, and grammatical category of the lexical item containing /d/.

We argue that because of its continuity with the canonical use, the hesitator koo (a) projects a descriptive term as a possible search outcome, and (b) indicates difficulty in describing in words what the speaker wants to say. In addition to initiating or continuing a search, the hesitator koo provides information about the type and nature of the resolution of search, thereby enhancing the intersubjectivity of the search process.

Through in-depth interviews with ten journalists working for Korean news organizations, supplemented with an analysis of self-reflective articles, this study investigates how journalists experience this audience hostility and harassment, how they cope with it, and how their practices are influenced by it. The analysis reveals that, combined with the dualistic views of populist politics and the influence of misogynic narratives, journalists who cover topics, such as politics and gender, are more likely to become targets of anti-press violence. Moreover, it shows that anti-press violence induces negative emotions, such as discomfort, anger, lethargy, and fear, among journalists. To cope with these emotions, with little support from their news organizations, journalists tend to pursue emotion-focused coping strategies, such as striving for perfection in the newswork process, building emotional boundaries between the audience and themselves, counter-hating readers, and blaming other journalists. Finally, the paper suggests that anti-press violence in Korea promotes a chilling effect in news organizations that, consequently, may infringe on individual journalists' autonomy and editorial independence.","[Kim, Changwook] Handong Global Univ, Global Leadership Sch, Pohang, South Korea; [Shin, Wooyeol] Kyungnam Univ, Dept Media & Visual Arts, Chang Won, South Korea",,"Shin, W (corresponding author), Kyungnam Univ, Dept Media & Visual Arts, Chang Won, South Korea.",wooyeolshin@gmail.com,"Shin, Wooyeol/ABA-2429-2021","Shin, Wooyeol/0000-0003-3813-4103; Kim, Changwook/0000-0002-7657-2094",,,,,30,0,0,2,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

Hargan (an appellate case regarding unaccompanied immigrant minors' abortion rights) alongside systemic injustices in immigration detention (e.g., exposure to miscarriage risks, coerced sterilization, shackling). These injustices, I argue, emerge from conflicts and compromises over fetal citizenship within the American radical right. Although pro-life and anti-immigrant discourses assume opposing logics of citizenship, respectively interpreting immigrants' fetuses as fetal citizens or anchor babies, these contradictions are neutralized by two techniques. Debilitation (systematic degradation of a disposable population) enables the appearance of fetal protection to coexist with de facto exposure to death, injury, and risk. Paralegality (quasi-legal policy making by enforcement agents) allows situational shifts in the meaning of fetal citizenship and adjustments to the pro-life/anti-immigrant compromise. Both obscure culpability for reproductive injustice, reinforce interlocking oppressions, and control women's bodies in order to control the body politic's demographic future.","[Leach, Brittany R.] Univ Virginia, Dept Women Gender & Sexual Studies, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA",,"Leach, BR (corresponding author), Univ Virginia, Dept Women Gender & Sexual Studies, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA.",brl4xd@virgina.edu,,,Citizen and Scholars Foundation's Charlotte Newcombe Doctoral Dissertation Fellowship,Citizen and Scholars Foundation's Charlotte Newcombe Doctoral Dissertation Fellowship,"I amgrateful for the support of the Citizen and Scholars Foundation's Charlotte Newcombe Doctoral Dissertation Fellowship and for the guidance of my dissertation committee: Lawrie Balfour, Denise Walsh, Stephen K.

Drawing on a preregistered research design, we test the influence of dual socioeconomic revolutions that spread throughout Africa during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries-export agriculture and print technologies. We argue these changes transformed ethnicity via their effects on politicization and boundary-making. Print technologies strengthened imagined communities, leading to more salient-yet porous-ethnic identities. Cash crop endowments increased groups' mobilizational potential but with more exclusionary boundaries to control agricultural rents. Using historical data on cash crops and African language publications, we find that groups exposed to these historical forces are more likely to be politically relevant in the postindependence period, and their members report more salient ethnic identities. We observe heterogenous effects on boundary-making as measured by interethnic marriage; relative to cash crops, printing fostered greater openness to assimilate linguistically related outsiders. Our findings illuminate not only the historical sources of ethnic politicization but also mechanisms shaping boundary formation.","[Pengl, Yannick, I] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Humanities Social & Polit Sci, Int Conflict Res, Zurich, Switzerland; [Roessler, Philip] William & Mary, Dept Govt, Williamsburg, VA USA; [Rueda, Valeria] Univ Nottingham, Dept Econ, Nottingham, England",,"Pengl, YI (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Humanities Social & Polit Sci, Int Conflict Res, Zurich, Switzerland.",yannick.pengl@icr.gess.ethz.ch; proessler@wm.edu; valeria.rueda@nottingham.ac.uk,,"Pengl, Yannick/0000-0002-0373-0952; Rueda, Valeria/0000-0002-4967-3172",Swiss National Science Foundation [P0EZP1_159076]; US National Science Foundation [1628498],Swiss National Science Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)European Commission); US National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"This research was generously supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation (grant #P0EZP1_159076, Pengl) and the US National Science Foundation (award #1628498, Roessler).",,118,0,0,6,6,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0003-0554,1537-5943,,AM POLIT SCI REV,Am.

Centering colonialism and racism in our analysis, this commentary considers how applied linguistics often focuses on modest reforms supporting affirmation and inclusion of marginalized populations and practices, rather than on fundamental institutional changes required to eradicate the forces that produce marginalization. As applied linguists grapple with questions surrounding the extent to which their work contributes in substantive ways to social justice struggles, we are inspired by collaborations that challenge us to reconsider normative assumptions about both language and justice. These collaborations demand a comprehensive reckoning that frames social justice not as a normative reality that can be achieved through modest reforms to liberal governance, but rather as an existential horizon that necessitates a fundamental reimagination of communication's role in narrating and creating decolonial worlds that sustain collective well-being.","[Rosa, Jonathan] Stanford Univ, Grad Sch Educ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Flores, Nelson] Univ Penn, Grad Sch Educ, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",,"Rosa, J (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Grad Sch Educ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",jdrosa@stanford.edu,,,,,,,0,1,1,11,11,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0142-6001,1477-450X,,APPL LINGUIST,Appl.

While research use (or lack thereof) in the classroom has been debated by researchers for decades, researchers have rarely investigated themselves as stakeholders in the relationship. However, it is vital to know researchers' approaches to the issue so that collaborative researcher-practitioner relationships may be fostered. Hence, the current survey study explored: (a) L2 researchers' identities; (b) their perceptions of the research-practice relationship; and (c) predictors of their perceptions. Participants were 217 researchers from 25 countries with 31 different first-language backgrounds. The results showed that L2 researchers' identities often crossed multiple boundaries, as L2 learners, teachers, as well as researchers. A factor analysis showed that researchers held distinct beliefs for their own research (individual self) and for researchers in general (collective self). The regression models revealed that L2 teaching experience, pre-service teacher training experience, and institutional rewards positively predicted researchers' perceptions of L2 practice.

We assessed cognitive performance in working memory, alertness, divided attention, and verbal fluency on a weekly basis.

Our results provide no evidence of cognitive improvement differing between the Spanish and either of the control groups during any phase of the training period. We did, however, observe an effect of baseline cognition, such that individuals with low cognitive baselines increased their performance more in the L2 group than comparable individuals in the control groups.

Through the framework of construal level theory, we investigated whether different levels of spatial distance influence these effects. In a between-subjects experiment, participants in the United Kingdom (UK; n = 282) and New Zealand (NZ; n = 370) read a satirical or non-satirical news text summarizing a study reporting on the negative impact of increased digital device screen time on young children. Depending on condition, the texts referred to entities and locations in either the participant's own country (spatially close) or a foreign country (spatially distant). Results showed significant main effects of satirical news on audience perceptions, emotions, and attitudes. While there were no significant interactions between article type (satirical vs. regular news) and spatial distance (close vs. distant), our results indicated that satirical news was associated with higher perceptions of spatial distance for both the UK and NZ participants as well as higher perceptions of social distance for the NZ participants. Exploratory indirect-effects analyses found several indirect effects of satirical news through increased perceptions of spatial and social psychological distance on audience emotions, text perceptions, and attitudes. We take these results as initial evidence suggesting spatial and social distance are potential variables to consider in future investigations of satirical news.","[Skalicky, Stephen] Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Linguist & Appl Language Studies, Wellington, New Zealand; [Brugman, Britta C.; Droog, Ellen; Burgers, Christian] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Commun Sci, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Burgers, Christian] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Sch Commun Res ASCoR, Amsterdam, Netherlands",,"Brugman, BC (corresponding author), Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Commun Sci, Amsterdam, Netherlands.",b.c.brugman@vu.nl,"Burgers, Christian/C-6093-2011","Burgers, Christian/0000-0002-5652-9021; Brugman, Britta/0000-0002-0064-5154; Droog, E.F./0000-0002-9852-7470","Victoria University of Wellington Research Establishment Grant (REG) [222263, 276-45-005]; Dutch Research Council (NWO)",Victoria University of Wellington Research Establishment Grant (REG); Dutch Research Council (NWO)(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)),"This work was supported by a Victoria University of Wellington Research Establishment Grant (REG) [Grant Number 222263].

Also, contrary to the well-entrenched conceptualisation of memes as a type of humour, the majority of the memes at hand manifest no humorous potential. Humour is present mainly among the negative-stance memes, which points to the disparagement of a target as a concomitant of humour in the memes on this serious political topic.","[Dynel, Marta; Poppi, Fabio I.

Men are more likely than women to report commenting for corrective or information giving reasons. Women are more likely than men to report reading comments in order to gauge the public's opinions. Moreover, these patterns of behavior were not dependent on topic - both men and women were equally likely to cite these reasons on both political topics and other news stories.

For children with severe speech impairment (SSI) who have little or no intelligible speech, active participation in conversations is challenging and can be critical for their social inclusion and participation. The present study investigated the conversational patterns emerging from interactions between children with SSI who use aided communication and typically speaking conversation partners (CPs) and explored whether active participation was different in interactions with different numbers of partners (dyadic versus multi-person interactions). An unusually large multilingual dataset was used (N= 85 conversations). This allowed us to systematically investigate discourse analysis measures indicating participation: the distribution of conversational control (initiations versus responses versus recodes) and summoning power (obliges versus comments). The findings suggest that (i) conversations were characterized by asymmetrical conversational patterns with CPs assuming most of the conversational control and (ii) multi-person interactions were noticeably more symmetric compared to dyadic, as children's active participation in multi-person interactions was significantly increased.

J,"Bejan, TM",,,,"Bejan, Teresa M.",,,What Was the Point of Equality?,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE,,,English,Article; Early Access,,,,,,,,"Political theorists often turn to seventeenth-century England and the Levellers as sources of egalitarian insight. Yet by the time the Levellers were active, the claim that human beings were equal by nature was commonplace. Why, in Leveller hands, did a long-standing piety consistent with social hierarchy became suddenly effectual? Inspired by Elizabeth Anderson, this article explores what equality-and the related concept of parity-meant for the Levellers, and what the point, as they saw it, was. I argue that the Levellers' key achievement was subsuming a highly controversial premise of natural parity within the existing language of natural equality. This suggests that modern basic equality is the product of two, potentially contradictory, principles. This, in turn, has important normative, as well as historical and conceptual, implications for how theorists understand the point of equality for egalitarian movements today.","[Bejan, Teresa M.] Univ Oxford, Dept Polit & Int Relat, Oriel Coll, Polit Theory & Oriel Coll, Manor Rd, Oxford OX1 3UQ, England",,"Bejan, TM (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Dept Polit & Int Relat, Oriel Coll, Polit Theory & Oriel Coll, Manor Rd, Oxford OX1 3UQ, England.",teresa.bejan@politics.ox.ac.uk,,,,,,,61,1,1,2,2,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0092-5853,1540-5907,,AM J POLIT SCI,Am.

Based on a linguistic ethnography, this article presents some of these neglected perspectives on English for development at a private and unreformed Qawmi madrasa in rural Bangladesh. The findings show that people in the madrasa from a reflexively traditional stance, reject economic progress and western development programmes, and largely resist English as a language of development. These positions are considerably shaped by their commitments to religion and Arabic, supporting their alternative language and development visions.

This article, however, reports on nondisaffiliative uses of rhetorical questions based on a particular structure in Mandarin, bushi horizontal ellipsis ma, which can serve as a conventional question, a disaffiliative rhetorical question, or a nondisaffiliative rhetorical question. Although much less studied, nondisaffiliative uses are by far more frequent in conversations. Integrating discourse-functional linguistics and conversation analysis, this study argues that nondisaffiliative bushi horizontal ellipsis ma rhetorical questions work to pursue common ground so as to move the activity-in-progress forward. Moreover, it examines the sequential contexts in which they are recurrently produced and identifies the interactional clues-epistemic, sequential, prosodic-that make these rhetorical questions recognizable as seeking common ground. This article contributes to our understanding of the rhetorical question as a grammatical device that maximizes intersubjectivity in conversation, further confirming the mutual influence between grammar and social interaction.

Using this framework, we show that the randomization of texts alone is insufficient to identify the causal effects of latent treatments, because other unmeasured treatments in the text could confound the measured treatment's effect. We provide a set of assumptions that is sufficient to identify the effect of latent treatments and a set of strategies to make these assumptions more plausible, including explicitly adjusting for potentially confounding text features and nontraditional experimental designs involving many versions of the text.

I argue that Mexican insurgents deployed Indigenous genealogies to instantiate what I call restorative revolution, a form of revolutionary thinking that prioritized memorialization over absolute foundation. Mexico's restorative project began with calls for the return of the Anahuac Empire, an Indigenous genealogy that memorialized histories of popular self-rule to legitimize postcolonial demands. I suggest that the Anahuac movement transformed the principles of radical republican thought by mobilizing around religious, plebeian, and hemispheric identities. Each of these characteristics problematizes dominant interpretations of republicanism as a secular, elite, and national enterprise.

Employing a non-binary gender identification built on usernames, I investigate the role of gender in shaping users' experience in technical forums. The analysis encompasses 11-years of activity, across levels of expertise, language, and specialism, to assess if Stack Overflow is really a paradise for programmers. I first examine individual users, asking if there are gender differences in key user metrics of success, focusing on reputation points, user tenure, and level of activity. Second, I test if there are gender-biases in how technical knowledge is recognised in the question-answer format of the platform. Third, using social network analysis I investigate if interaction on Stack Overflow is organised by gender. Results show that sharing and recognising technical knowledge is dictated by users' gender, even when it is operationalised beyond a binary. I find that feminine users receive lower scores for their answers, despite exhibiting higher effort in their contributions. I also show that interaction on Stack Overflow is organised by gender. Specifically, that feminine users preferentially interact with other feminine users. The findings emphasise the central role of gender in shaping interaction in technical spaces, a necessity for participation in the masculine-dominated forum. I conclude the study with recommendations for inclusivity in online forums.","[Brooke, S. J.] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Methodol, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Brooke, S.

The present study contributes to this growing body of literature by focusing on playful talk in multiple languages and modalities in EMI mathematics classrooms in a secondary school in Hong Kong. Based on the data collected from a linguistic ethnography, we analyze how the teacher constructs playful talk in order to achieve various pedagogical goals including building rapport, facilitating content explanation and promoting meaningful communication with students. The analysis demonstrates that translanguaging appears to be a critical resource and that several social factors, including the teacher's personal belief, history, sociocultural, and pedagogical knowledge, play a role in constructing playful talk. The playful talk transforms the classroom into a translanguaging space, which in turn allows the teacher and students to perform a range of creative acts and experiment with a variety of voices to facilitate the meaning making and knowledge construction processes.","[Tai, Kevin W.

The analysis is based upon a survey-experiment conducted on one of the world's largest online language learning platforms. Drawing on theories of media globalization, cosmopolitanism and language ideologies, the study explores the factors that drive participation in online language learning and the attributes students favor in teacher selection. The results suggest that student preferences are closely related to learning motivations and media consumption. Specifically, 'pop cosmopolitan' students are far more likely to favor native speakers than students who are motivated by more mundane instrumental goals (such as career advancement). We attribute these findings to enduring perceptions about native speakers as more authentic representations of a particular language and culture. The implications of these findings for theories of pop cosmopolitanism and online language learning are discussed.","[Curran, Nathaniel Ming] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept English & Commun, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Zhen, Lichen; Galperin, Hernan] Univ Southern Calif, Annenberg Sch Commun & Journalism, Los Angeles, CA 90007 USA",,"Curran, NM (corresponding author), Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Hunghom Kowloon, Room AG410,Chung Sze Yuen Bldg, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",nate-ming.curran@polyu.edu.hk,,,2020 Korean Studies Grant Program of the Academy of Korean Studies [AKS-2020-R21]; USC-SJTU Institute of Cultural and Creative Industry,2020 Korean Studies Grant Program of the Academy of Korean Studies; USC-SJTU Institute of Cultural and Creative Industry,This publication was supported by the 2020 Korean Studies Grant Program of the Academy of Korean Studies (AKS-2020-R21) and a grant from the USC-SJTU Institute of Cultural and Creative Industry.,,66,3,3,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

However, no one has demonstrated a causal effect of cell phone access on health and well-being. Using a 7-month longitudinal field experiment we investigated how stable cellphone access impacts health and quality of life of people experiencing poverty (N = 45, median annual income = $7,216). Participants received phone cards providing unlimited talk, text, and data (n = 23) or were given grocery store gift cards of the equivalent amount (n = 22). Over the course of the experiment, participants in the treatment group reported better health and quality of life compared to those in the control group. Emotional social support moderated this relationship in such a way that those with the least social support benefited the most from stable cellphone access (supporting a 'poor-get-richer' hypothesis).

J,"Singh, P",,,,"Singh, Pawan",,,Aadhaar and data privacy: biometric identification and anxieties of recognition in India,INFORMATION COMMUNICATION & SOCIETY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Data privacy; biometrics; recognition; anxieties; dignity; class,,"The data privacy debate in India has evolved with respect to the government's biometric identity programme, Aadhaar that enrols welfare-dependent, poor populations to grant them access to government benefits. While legal challenges to Aadhaar by civil society groups argued that the biometric identity infrastructure creates conditions of mass surveillance and violation of individual privacy, the Indian Supreme Court in 2018 ruled that the government was justified in restricting individual privacy for the collective good of providing welfare in a transparent and corruption-free manner. Given the disproportionate burden on these populations to prove their identities to the state, this paper draws on a close reading of legal and policy texts, and activist documentation to argue that there is a need to move beyond the narrative of mass surveillance as privacy violation. Data privacy interests of the welfare-dependent emerge in the moment of biometric authentication, which creates anxieties of recognition when their authentication attempts fail or are deliberately falsified. Often, to have better social mobility, they are compelled to be physically mobile in order to enrol or update their records under conditions of physical disability and meagre socioeconomic means. These anxieties illuminate their privacy interests through a compromise of dignity or dignified living, a formulation articulated in the 2018 Aadhaar verdict. The paper makes a critical contribution to the global conversation on data privacy through a discussion of the Indian case that demonstrates the privacy-recognition nexus in local contexts.","[Singh, Pawan] Deakin Univ, Contemporary Hist, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Singh, Pawan] Univ Melbourne, Australia India Inst, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",,"Singh, P (corresponding author), Deakin Univ, Contemporary Hist, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.;Singh, P (corresponding author), Univ Melbourne, Australia India Inst, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.",pawan.singh@deakin.edu.au,,,,,,,32,5,5,2,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

The collection of papers in this special issue challenges the field of applied linguistics to move beyond an acknowledgement of social inequities (through observation, analysis, and critique) toward cultivating relationships for justice (CRJ) - in order to undo past harms and collectively imagine more just futures. The authors/collaborators demonstrate how building systemic social change involves decentering the individual researcher's interests and instead foregrounding processes of collective solidarity (Martinez et al. 2021), demonstrating how justice is relational and aspirational. In this editorial, we discuss the particular contributions of each paper, alongside thematic connection points across the articles. Our intention in including an editorial, commentaries, and a range of papers is to create space for multi-vocality and diverse genres as part of CRJ.

Through a critical analysis of the Ring surveillant assemblage, this paper reveals the way Ring and its associated apps produce fear and paranoia of the racialized Other, promote community buy-in that more surveillance will improve safety, while obscuring private partnerships with local law enforcement. I argue Ring cannot be viewed in isolation from its entangled corporate owner, Amazon, which relies on an ever-expanding infrastructural network, including surveillance of their highly prized package delivery service. Ring is more than individual community members installing doorbells with cameras that extend beyond their property into public space; it is the blurring of boundaries between police work and civilian surveillance, the reliance on obscured digital infrastructures that hide to whom and what users are connecting when they install a Ring device, and the expansion of Amazon's vast infrastructural power. By recentering critique on the infrastructural backbone, made up of discourses and fixtures, this paper argues for the need for infrastructural accountability from companies such as Amazon, who not only profit from fear, but actively reproduce structural violence through their data infrastructures.","[Bridges, Lauren] Univ Penn, Annenberg Sch Commun, 3620 Walnut St, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",,"Bridges, L (corresponding author), Univ Penn, Annenberg Sch Commun, 3620 Walnut St, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",lauren.bridges@asc.upenn.edu,,"Bridges, Lauren/0000-0002-2932-3423",,,,,57,1,1,1,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

We focus on the methodic ways in which, over the course of 4 years, a second language speaker and initially novice to such interactions coordinates the transition between interacting with her coparticipants and consulting her own screen, which suspends talk, without creating trouble due to halts in progressivity. Initially drawing on diverse resources, she increasingly resorts to the use of a prospective alert constructed around the verb to check (e.g., I will check), which eventually routinizes in the lexically specific form let me check as a highly context- and activity-bound social action format. We discuss how such change over the participant's video-mediated interactional history contributes to our understanding of social coordination in video-mediated interaction and of participants' recalibrating their grammar-for-interaction while adapting to new situations, languages, or media.

Our scaling procedure results in estimated ideal points on a common scale. As a result, we are able to directly compare a member's revealed preferences across different domains of voting (different sets of motions) to assess if, for example, a member votes more conservatively on agriculture motions than on defense. In doing so, we are able to assess the extent to which voting behavior of an individual voter is consistent with a uni-dimensional spatial model-if a member has the same preferences in all domains. The key novelty is to estimate rather than assume the identity of stayers-voters whose revealed preference is constant across votes. Our approach offers methodology for investigating the relationship between the basic space and issue space in legislative voting (Poole 2007). There are several methodological advantages to our approach. First, our model allows for testing sharp hypotheses. Second, the methodology developed can be understood as a kind of partial-pooling model for item response theory scaling, resulting in less uncertainty of estimates. Related, our estimation method provides a principled and unified approach to the issue of granularity (i.e., the level of aggregation) in the analysis of roll-call data (Crespin and Rohde 2010; Roberts et al. 2016). We illustrate the model by estimating U.S. House of Representatives members' revealed preferences in different policy domains, and identify several other potential applications of the model including: studying the relationship between committee and floor voting behavior; and investigating constituency influence and representation.","[Moser, Scott] Univ Nottingham, Sch Polit & Int Relat, Nottingham, England; [Rodriguez, Abel; Lofland, Chelsea L.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Stat, 1156 High St,Mailstop SOE2, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA",,"Moser, S (corresponding author), Univ Nottingham, Sch Polit & Int Relat, Nottingham, England.",scott.moser@nottingham.ac.uk; abel@soe.ucsc.edu; clofland@soe.ucsc.edu,"Moser, Scott/AAA-1673-2022","Moser, Scott/0000-0002-4812-4825; Rodriguez, Abel/0000-0001-5503-7394","NSF-DMS [1738053, 1740850]",NSF-DMS(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"An earlier version of this work was presented at the 2017 Midwest Political Science Association Annual Conference under the title Comparing Revealed Preferences Across Multiple Types of Motions in the 83rd to 112th, U.S. House of Representatives.

In this article, I argue for a discourse-oriented ethnographic account as an alternative method for documenting and reporting such reflexivity. The overall goal of this article is to examine reflexive research practices in the study of tourism communication. Presenting illustrative cases, I closely analyze how the researcher's co-presence naturally opens up opportunities for some form of intervention in tourist-guide dyads. I show that researcher participation that is intended to resolve local interactional problems can have unintended consequences resulting in marginalization or exclusion of the key participants. The analysis shows that the researcher is not only the knowledge-maker in applied linguistics research but is also an object of analysis in the process. Overall, the study is intended to invite workplace researchers to reflect on whether and how much to participate, how their participation shapes researcher-participant relationships, how their relationship impacts data and knowledge claims, and how issues of balance and distance can be negotiated.","[Sharma, Bal Krishna] Univ Idaho, Dept English, 875 Perimeter Dr, Moscow, ID 83843 USA",,"Sharma, BK (corresponding author), Univ Idaho, Dept English, 875 Perimeter Dr, Moscow, ID 83843 USA.",balsharma@uidaho.edu,,,TIRF Doctoral Dissertation Grant; Global Supplementary Grant; Civil Society Scholar Award,TIRF Doctoral Dissertation Grant; Global Supplementary Grant; Civil Society Scholar Award,"I would like to acknowledge the grants received from the following sources for this research: TIRF Doctoral Dissertation Grant, Global Supplementary Grant, and Civil Society Scholar Award.",,46,2,2,4,13,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0142-6001,1477-450X,,APPL LINGUIST,Appl.

But this process can be particularly challenging for movements that are explicitly opposed to using a market mechanism as a means of scaling up. Our analysis of yoga between 1975 and 2016 reveals how a countercultural movement fundamentally opposed to a capitalist market economy but seeking to grow can paradoxically become syncretic with or infiltrated by concepts and beliefs that are core to the market system but incompatible with the movement's original ethos. We show how, before such a movement can be commodified, it must be de-essentialized, a process that requires stripping away key aspects of its history, context, and religious commitments and transforming collective goals into individual ones. This process involves not only external entrepreneurs looking to mine the movement but also movement leaders seeking wider enrollment of resource-rich actors to scale the movement up. We show how codes borrowed from parallel movements and templates borrowed from markets can be instrumental in driving such a movement's transformation. Through this extreme case of the yoga movement, we advance understandings of how movements can become syncretic with values and practices they fundamentally oppose.","[Munir, Kamal; Ansari, Shahzad (Shaz)] Univ Cambridge, Judge Business Sch, Cambridge, England; [Brown, Deborah] Univ Cambridge, Dept Polit & Int Studies, Cambridge, England",,"Munir, K (corresponding author), Univ Cambridge, Judge Business Sch, Cambridge, England.",k.munir@jbs.cam.ac.uk; s.ansari@jbs.cam.ac.uk; dmb60@cam.ac.uk,,"Ansari, Shahzad (Shaz)/0000-0002-3620-078X; munir, kamal/0000-0001-5449-3638",,,,,164,3,3,13,27,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0001-8392,1930-3815,,ADMIN SCI QUART,Adm.

To do so, we classify over 2.1 million tweets sent during two congressional terms (2015 through 2018) to determine how often members use explicitly partisan language. Since lawmakers are strategic in how they communicate with the public, we argue our approach captures a member's partisan intensity, the time and effort they devote to supporting their party. After validating our measure, we examine how partisanship affects commonly studied legislative behaviors. We show it predicts, independent of ideology, a lawmaker's party-unity voting and expressed bipartisanship. Additionally, we find that presidential support is principally driven by partisanship, not ideology. Our findings offer two contributions.

The present study combines sequential and distributional analyses to explicate the particle's relationship to the conversational repair system. It demonstrates that you know functions as an adjunct to repair, addressing secondary difficulties associated with implementing self-repair in practice, while also promoting the avoidance of transformative repair operations. This repair adjunct viewpoint trades off the particle's general import as an alignment token and is supported by examining its specialized role in: (a) self-repair operations, (b) suboptimal formulations, and (c) understanding pursuits. This article elaborates our understanding of the repair system by identifying an ancillary practice that smooths over recurrent shortcomings of natural speech.

This article instead treats Hume's Of the Balance of Power, alongside the other essays in his Political Discourses (1752), as conceptual resources for a historically inflected analysis of state balancing. Hume's defense of the balance of power cannot be divorced from his critique of commercial warfare in Of the Balance of Trade and Of the Jealousy of Trade. To better appreciate Hume's historical and economic approach to foreign policy, this article places Hume in conversation with Machiavelli, Guicciardini, Andrew Fletcher, and Montesquieu. International relations scholars suspicious of static paradigms should reconsider Hume's genealogy of the balance of power, which differs from the standard liberal and neorealist accounts. Well before International Political Economy developed as a formal subdiscipline, Hume was conceptually treating economics and power politics in tandem.","[Charette, Danielle] Univ Chicago, Comm Social Thought, Chicago, IL 60637 USA",,"Charette, D (corresponding author), Univ Chicago, Comm Social Thought, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",dcharette@uchicago.edu,,"Charette, Danielle/0000-0002-9233-9380",,,,,105,0,0,5,9,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0003-0554,1537-5943,,AM POLIT SCI REV,Am.

Participants were 56 university learners majoring in French (n=29) and Spanish (n=27), who spent an academic year abroad in the middle of a four-year BA degree programme. Oral data were collected six times over 21months to trace development and change in complexity, accuracy, fluency, and lexis. Results showed ongoing improvements over time on most measures, including accuracy. Correlations indicated long-term relationships between fluency and vocabulary only and that accuracy-complexity relationships emerged in instructed home contexts only. These findings suggest that the affordances of home and abroad contexts can shape learners' linguistic development and use differently. The role of pre-departure linguistic ability is discussed as critical to understanding the nature and extent of L2 linguistic development in study abroad.","[McManus, Kevin] Penn State Univ, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Mitchell, Rosamond] Univ Southampton, Southampton, Hants, England; [Tracy-Ventura, Nicole] West Virginia Univ, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA",,"McManus, K (corresponding author), Penn State Univ, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",kmcmanus@psu.edu,,,UK Economic and Social Research Council [RES-062-23-2996],UK Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),UK Economic and Social Research Council (Grant number: RES-062-23-2996).,,64,4,4,9,21,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0142-6001,1477-450X,,APPL LINGUIST,Appl.

A large body of work in the social sciences has investigated the influence of celebrity role models, and in the context of education, several disciplines have a rich research history in this area (e.g. medical education). However, in the context of second language acquisition, research centred on role models has largely remained on the periphery. This study presents a large-scale international survey investigating the role models of English language learners. With data collected from 8,472 participants, analysis investigated whether these learners had English language role models, who the role models were and what characteristics learners valued in them, and investigated systematic variation among subgroups. Results showed that 68 per cent of respondents reported having an English language role model, and four key role model dimensions emerged: overall command of English, paralinguistic features, personal attributes and accent/variety of English. We argue that role modelling may be a highly influential component of the psychological context of second-language acquisition, and conclude by highlighting several valuable areas for future research.","[Muir, Christine; Dornyei, Zoltan; Adolphs, Svenja] Univ Nottingham, Sch English, Nottingham, England",,"Muir, C (corresponding author), Univ Nottingham, Sch English, Nottingham, England.",christine.muir@nottingham.ac.uk,,,Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council Impact Acceleration Account grant (EPSRC IAA) [RR1402],Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council Impact Acceleration Account grant (EPSRC IAA)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),This study was funded by an Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council Impact Acceleration Account grant (EPSRC IAA Reference: RR1402).,,64,10,10,10,30,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0142-6001,1477-450X,,APPL LINGUIST,Appl.

The results of a self-paced reading study combined with a sensicality judgment showed that people with less versus more multilingual experience process metaphors evaluated as being (i) less or (ii) more creative quite similarly in terms of reading times; however, the groups differ significantly in their judgments of semantic sensicality for the more creative metaphors. Although in the case of less creative metaphors groups do not differ, in the case of more creative metaphors, people with more multilingual experience are more likely to say that the metaphor makes sense. We interpret these findings as showing that people with more multilingual experience access the nonsalient semantic features of the concepts compared in the metaphor with less effort and can employ richer semantic representations, which complements previous research on multilingualism and cognitive flexibility.","[Horvat, Ana Werkmann] Inst Croatian Language & Linguist, Republike Austrije 16, Zagreb, Croatia; [Bolognesi, Marianna] Univ Bologna, Dept Modern Languages Literatures & Cultures, Bologna, Italy; [Kohl, Katrin] Univ Oxford, Fac Medieval & Modern Languages, Oxford, England",,"Horvat, AW (corresponding author), Inst Croatian Language & Linguist, Republike Austrije 16, Zagreb, Croatia.",awerkmann@gmail.com,,,Arts and Humanities Research Council (Open World Research Initiative: Creative Multilingualism) [AH/N004701/1],Arts and Humanities Research Council (Open World Research Initiative: Creative Multilingualism),We would like to thank the members of the Language and Brain Laboratory in Oxford for their assistance and advice.

In this comparative study, we examine how the institutional actor behind the privacy violation affects discourse surrounding the violations. Looking at newspaper and blog coverage surrounding two similar invasions of privacy - the NSA espionage programs that Edward Snowden brought to light alongside Verizon and other corporations' use of a tracking code called a supercookie - we show key differences in the how media reactions to the topic are discursively constructed. Our findings show more moral polarization surrounding the characterization of the NSA and the perceived threat of their actions compared to media coverage on supercookies.

This shift resolved some long-standing problems but insulated the analysis of populism from theoretical and methodological debates in the social sciences. Theoretical restrictions have gone hand in hand with geographical neglect: The near-exclusive focus on the United States, Europe, and Latin America reinforces the blind spots of these existing approaches. An integration of overlooked regions holds the potential for theoretical reconstruction, even though such comparative broadening could as well simply reproduce the persistent impasses. Moreover, post-2016 developments have induced a return to substantive issues, throwing into sharp relief what populism studies have been missing during the past decades. The main challenge today is synthesizing socioeconomic analyses with institutionalist and discourse-theoretical advances without falling into eclecticism. Breaking away from the entrenched regional orientations to embrace a more global-historical methodology could help such an endeavor.","[Tugal, Cihan] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Sociol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",,"Tugal, C (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Sociol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",ctugal@berkeley.edu,,,,,,,148,2,2,2,3,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",0360-0572,1545-2115,978-0-8243-2247-2,ANNU REV SOCIOL,Annu.

However, there is a lack of consistent terminology in scholarly literature with regards to such practice and a dearth of studies that compare practice on a wider scale that prevents more holistic understanding of how audience data are being used on the newsroom floor. These issues are addressed with the development of a new participative gatekeeping model with three previously unidentified channels of gatekeeping specifically related to the use of audience data: promotional, for the type of short-term gatekeeping done on news site homepages that involves tracking real-time metrics to position content, often tied to traffic targets; developmental, or longer-term strategies that shape future coverage and are grounded in hypotheses of audience behaviour gleaned from analytics; and a third more porous channel of experimentation where such hypotheses are tested. These channels were observed in ethnographic research in six newsrooms in three different countries at media outlets with diverse sources of revenue: Norway's public broadcaster, NRK; Canada's subscriber-based national news agency, The Canadian Press (CP); and two local newsrooms working within larger media organizations, The Hamilton Spectator in Canada, and The Bournemouth Daily Echo in England. Through a sociological lens, this article distinguishes language to best document the complex processes interconnected with audience data, identifies similarities in practice that override media or revenue systems, and explores how the audience, through the participatory mechanisms of metrics and analytics, shapes newsroom practice.","[Blanchett, Nicole] Bournemouth Univ, Poole, Dorset, England; [Blanchett, Nicole] Sheridan Coll, Inst Technol & Adv Learning, Fac Animat Arts & Design, Oakville, ON, Canada; [Blanchett, Nicole] Ryerson Univ, Sch Journalism, Toronto, ON, Canada",,"Blanchett, N (corresponding author), Bournemouth Univ, Poole, Dorset, England.;Blanchett, N (corresponding author), Sheridan Coll, Inst Technol & Adv Learning, Fac Animat Arts & Design, Oakville, ON, Canada.;Blanchett, N (corresponding author), Ryerson Univ, Sch Journalism, Toronto, ON, Canada.",nicole.blanchett@ryerson.ca,"Blanchett, Nicole/AAO-9616-2020","Blanchett, Nicole/0000-0001-9444-2018",,,,,90,1,1,3,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

To date, the literature has treated this theory as a model that merely explains employer behavior. This article contends that the idea of statistical discrimination, rather than simply providing an explanation, can lead people to view social stereotyping as useful and acceptable and thus help rationalize and justify discriminatory decisions. A preregistered survey experiment with more than 2,000 participants who had managerial experience shows that exposure to statistical discrimination theory strengthened people's belief in the accuracy of stereotypes, their acceptance of stereotyping, and the extent to which they engaged in gender discrimination in a hiring simulation. Reading a critical commentary on the theory mitigated these effects. These findings imply that theories of discrimination, and the language associated with them, can rationalize-or challenge the rationality of-stereotypes and discrimination and, as a result, shape the attitudes and actions of decision-makers in labor markets.","[Tilcsik, Andras] Univ Toronto, Rotman Sch Management, Strategy Org & Soc, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Tilcsik, Andras] Univ Toronto, Rotman Sch Management, Strateg Management, Toronto, ON, Canada",,"Tilcsik, A (corresponding author), Univ Toronto, Rotman Sch Management, 105 St George St, Toronto, ON M5S 3E6, Canada.",andras.tilcsik@rotman.utoronto.ca,,,Institute for Gender and the Economy at the Rotman School of Management,Institute for Gender and the Economy at the Rotman School of Management,"I am grateful to the Institute for Gender and the Economy at the Rotman School of Management for its generous financial and intellectual support.

We evaluate this argument by measuring groups' revealed preferences directly, developing a set of ideal point estimates, IGscores, for over 2,600 interest groups and 950 members of Congress on a common scale. We generate the scores by jointly scaling a large dataset of interest groups' positions on congressional bills with roll-call votes on those same bills. Analyses of the scores uncover significant heterogeneity in the interest group system, with little conservative skew and notable inter-party differences in preference correspondence between legislators and ideologically similar groups. Conservative bias and homogeneity reappear, however, when weighting IGscores by groups' PAC contributions and lobbying expenditures. These findings suggest that bias among interest groups depends on the extent to which activities like PAC contributions and lobbying influence policymakers' perceptions about the preferences of organized interests.","[Crosson, Jesse M.] Princeton Univ, Ctr Study Democrat Polit, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Crosson, Jesse M.] Trinity Univ, Dept Polit Sci, San Antonio, TX 78212 USA; [Furnas, Alexander C.] Univ Michigan, Dept Polit Sci, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Lorenz, Geoffrey M.] Univ Nebraska, Dept Polit Sci, Lincoln, NE USA",,"Crosson, JM (corresponding author), Princeton Univ, Ctr Study Democrat Polit, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.;Crosson, JM (corresponding author), Trinity Univ, Dept Polit Sci, San Antonio, TX 78212 USA.",jcrosson@trinity.edu; zfurnas@umich.edu; gmlorenz@unl.edu,,"Lorenz, Geoffrey/0000-0003-3520-4233; Crosson, Jesse/0000-0003-4880-1037; Furnas, Alexander/0000-0001-8006-7798",,,,,83,10,10,4,7,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0003-0554,1537-5943,,AM POLIT SCI REV,Am.

Since the early 2000s, it has been accompanied by a range of important conceptual innovations by political theorists working on the topic. Yet, although many quantitative scholars are familiar with the conceptual literature, even the most complex quantitative studies eschew engaging with the new wave of more sophisticated concepts of representation that theorists have developed. We discuss what we take to be the main reasons for this gap between theory and empirics, and present four novel conceptions of representation that are both sensitive to theorists' conceptual impulses and operationalizable for quantitative scholars. In doing so, we advance an alternative research agenda on representation that moves significantly beyond the status quo of the field.","[Wolkenstein, Fabio] Aarhus Univ, Polit Sci, Dept Polit Sci, BSS, Bartholins Alle 7, DK-8000 Aarhus, Denmark; [Wratil, Christopher] UCL, European Polit, Dept Polit Sci, 29-31 Tavistock Sq, London WC1H 9QU, England; [Wratil, Christopher] UCL, Sch Publ Policy, 29-31 Tavistock Sq, London WC1H 9QU, England",,"Wolkenstein, F (corresponding author), Aarhus Univ, Polit Sci, Dept Polit Sci, BSS, Bartholins Alle 7, DK-8000 Aarhus, Denmark.",wolkenstein@ps.au.dk; c.wratil@ucl.ac.uk,,"Wratil, Christopher/0000-0002-7339-9628; Wolkenstein, Fabio/0000-0001-5030-7068",,,,,64,6,6,2,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0092-5853,1540-5907,,AM J POLIT SCI,Am.

Yet such efforts often fall short. Some studies do not demonstrate a gap in the literature, or they overgeneralize about the limitations of contemporary scholarship. Other studies misread contemporary authors or underestimate the complexity of contemporary issues. Interestingly, some studies use ideas that have been superseded: the history of political thought can constrain as well as liberate. Overall, I suggest, some of the boldest claims for the contemporary value of the history of political thought come from scholars whose own contemporary insights sometimes fall short. These problems risk undermining, not underlining, the contemporary relevance of the history of political thought. To draw contemporary insights from historical texts, we need to grasp how hard this can be.","[Blau, Adrian] Kings Coll London, Dept Polit Econ, Polit, Bush House,North East Wing,30 Aldwych, London WC2B 4BG, England",,"Blau, A (corresponding author), Kings Coll London, Dept Polit Econ, Polit, Bush House,North East Wing,30 Aldwych, London WC2B 4BG, England.",Adrian.Blau@kcl.ac.uk,,,,,,,132,1,1,2,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0092-5853,1540-5907,,AM J POLIT SCI,Am.

Drawing from face-negotiation theory, we recast the model in terms of face concern. Results of a survey of 715 participants indicated that mutual-face concern served as a particularly potent predictor of channel preferences. Channel net benefits mediated the association between the IMM predictors (i.e., face concern and valence) and likelihood of channel use, with communication competence serving as a weak moderator of several IMM predictors (specifically, other-face concern, mutual-face concern, and valence). These results highlight the importance of mutual-face concern in evaluating channel options, and also suggest that channel choice may have more to do with the avoidance of the risk of synchronous communication than a draw to the control of mediated channels.","[Ledbetter, Andrew M.; Herbert, Corley B.] Texas Christian Univ, Commun Studies, TCU Box 298045, Ft Worth, TX 76129 USA",,"Ledbetter, AM (corresponding author), Texas Christian Univ, Commun Studies, TCU Box 298045, Ft Worth, TX 76129 USA.",a.ledbetter@tcu.edu,,,,,,,38,1,1,3,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

The analysis suggests that such responses serve to take issue with the question; specifically, respondents display the answer to be obvious or redundant, challenge the questioner's unknowing stance, or disalign with the further action implications of the question while still providing a polar answer. Comparisons are made with other practices for exerting agency in responses and with resources described for other languages. The resources available in French help participants differentiate in which way the respondent takes issue with the question, notwithstanding significant local particularization by reference to the specific question and its context.

The results indicated that ever-vapers in the dogmatic PSA condition reported significantly greater freedom threats and state psychological reactance but not intentions to vape relative to ever-vapers in the suggestive PSA condition. Moreover, counterarguing dogmatic anti-vaping PSAs resulted in fewer available cognitive resources for encoding as evidenced by slower Secondary Task Reaction Times (STRTs) and reduced encoding of message content.

In this article, we draw on interviews with Nigerian media practitioners and a comparison of Boko Haram news coverage in two Nigerian newspapers-one Southern-based/Christian-affiliated and one Northern-based/Muslim-affiliated-to argue that it is crucial to consider a country's political-religious demography in order to understand the way in which religious-based violence is covered in the news. In this respect, we identify micro-, meso- and macro-level theoretical mechanisms through which a country's demography can promote domestic news outlets-regardless of their background and readership-to cover conflict in a more balanced, nuanced, and objective way.","[Demarest, Leila] Leiden Univ, Inst Polit Sci, Leiden, Netherlands; [Godefroidt, Amelie; Langer, Arnim] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Ctr Res Peace & Dev CRPD, Leuven, Belgium",,"Demarest, L (corresponding author), Leiden Univ, Inst Polit Sci, Leiden, Netherlands.",l.demarest@fsw.leidenuniv.nl,"Godefroidt, Amélie/AAY-7234-2020","Godefroidt, Amélie/0000-0002-5010-2860; Demarest, Leila/0000-0001-6887-9937",Research Foundation Flanders-FWO [11B5717N],Research Foundation Flanders-FWO(FWO),"The authors thank the editorial team, in particular Editor Lance Holbert and Associate Editor Keren Tenenboim-Weinblatt, for their valuable support and comments during the review process.

This may lead to hypercorrection, meaning that the prescribed form in one construction is extended to another one in which it is in fact prohibited by prescriptive grammar. We discuss two such cases in Dutch: the hypercorrect use of the comparative particle dan 'than' in equative constructions, and the hypercorrect use of the accusative pronoun hen 'them' for a dative object. In two experiments, high school students of three educational levels were tested on their use of these hypercorrect forms (n(exp1) = 162, n(exp2) = 159). Our results indicate an overall large amount of hypercorrection across all levels of education, including preuniversity level students who otherwise perform better in constructions targeted by prescriptive grammar rules. We conclude that while teaching prescriptive grammar rules to high school students seems to increase their use of correct forms in certain constructions, this comes at a cost of hypercorrection in others.","[Hubers, Ferdy; Trompenaars, Thijs; Collin, Sebastian; De Hoop, Helen] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Ctr Language Studies, Nijmegen, Netherlands; [De Schepper, Kees] Univ Utrecht, UMC Utrecht, Utrecht, Netherlands",,"Hubers, F (corresponding author), Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Ctr Language Studies, Nijmegen, Netherlands.",f.hubers@let.ru.nl,"Hubers, Ferdy/ABD-5504-2020","Hubers, Ferdy/0000-0002-2298-6013; de Hoop, Helen/0000-0001-8652-1146",,,,,34,2,2,2,5,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0142-6001,1477-450X,,APPL LINGUIST,Appl.

Eighteen speakers representing six English varieties were recruited to provide speech stimuli for two English listening tests. Sixty listeners from the same six English varieties took part in the listening tests, and their scores were then assessed against measurable segmental, prosodic, and fluency features found in the speech samples. Results indicate that it is possible to identify particular features of English speech varieties that are most likely to lead to a breakdown in communication, and that the number of such features present in a particular speakers' speech can predict intelligibility.","[Kang, Okim; Moran, Meghan] No Arizona Univ, Dept English, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA; [Thomson, Ron, I] Brock Univ, Appl Linguist, St Catharines, ON, Canada",,"Kang, O (corresponding author), No Arizona Univ, Dept English, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA.",okim.kang@nau.edu,,,Educational Testing Service (ETS) under a Committee of Examiners; TOEFL research grant,Educational Testing Service (ETS) under a Committee of Examiners; TOEFL research grant,"This research was funded by the Educational Testing Service (ETS) under a Committee of Examiners and the TOEFL research grant.

However, in the context of European constitutional courts, media coverage of court decisions can be understood to be a form of justice reporting that focuses on general public interest and is operationalized by case characteristics that indicate the newsworthiness of the decisions. Using the case of the German Federal Constitutional Court, the determining factors behind whether court decisions are featured in the German media (i.e., that they receive media coverage in at least one newspaper article) are expounded. A local text alignment measurement of court decisions and newspaper articles enables media coverage to be identified based on original data on 3,404 decisions and 9,436 newspaper articles from between 2008 and 2018. The results demonstrate that media coverage of the German Court is not affected by declarations of unconstitutionality, though coverage is more likely when a decision is accompanied by a press release, an oral hearing, a dissenting opinion, or a combination of all three items. As these decisional aspects are the prerogative of the FCC, the results demonstrate that the German Constitutional Court has the necessary instruments to independently influence media coverage.","[Meyer, Philipp] Leibniz Univ Hannover, Dept Polit Sci, Res Grp Comparat Govt & German Polit, Hannover, Germany",,"Meyer, P (corresponding author), Leibniz Univ Hannover, Dept Polit Sci, Hannover, Germany.",p.meyer@ipw.uni-hannover.de,"Meyer, Philipp/AAV-7313-2020","Meyer, Philipp/0000-0002-7986-9432",,,,,57,3,3,2,7,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1058-4609,1091-7675,,POLIT COMMUN,Polit.

The question is whether alternative imaginaries and typologies of digital entrepreneurship can be included in how we view digital entrepreneurship order to stimulate new practices and imagined futures. Our case studies of digital entrepreneurs in a number of African cities illustrate that popular and academic spatial imaginaries and discourses, for example those that cast the digital economy as borderless and accessible, do not correspond with the experience of many African entrepreneurs. Furthermore, enacting the metaphoric identities that coincide with these imaginaries and their discourses is a skillset that determines which (and how) actors can participate. They reflect the inherent coloniality of the digital, capitalist discourse. The tendency in the digital economy is to regard the entrepreneur persona, as realistic and global, rather than performative and particular to the Euro-American context in which these personas have originated. Our interviews of 186 digital entrepreneurs demonstrate that digital imaginaries and metaphors cannot be neutral and apolitical. In order to be inclusive, they should evoke a sense of multiplicity, heterogeneity and contingency.","[Wahome, Michel] Univ Strathclyde, Sch Law, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland; [Graham, M.] Univ Oxford, Oxford Internet Inst, Oxford, England",,"Wahome, M (corresponding author), Univ Strathclyde, Sch Law, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland.",michel.wahome@strath.ac.uk,,"Wahome, Michel Njeri/0000-0002-8524-210X",H2020 European Research Council,H2020 European Research Council,This work was supported by H2020 European Research Council.,,59,2,2,5,39,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

One way to obtain such information is to ask survey respondents to place actors on a common ideological scale, but, unfortunately, respondents typically display a set of biases when performing such placements. Key among these are rationalization bias and differential item functioning (DIF). While Aldrich-McKelvey (AM) scaling offers a useful solution to DIF, it ignores the issue of rationalization bias, and this study presents Monte Carlo simulations demonstrating that AM-type models thus can give inaccurate results. As a response to this challenge, this study develops an alternative Bayesian scaling approach, which simultaneously estimates DIF and rationalization bias, and therefore performs better when the latter bias is present.","[Bolstad, Jorgen] Univ Stavanger, Polit Sci, Stavanger, Norway",,"Bolstad, J (corresponding author), Univ Stavanger, Polit Sci, Stavanger, Norway.",jorgen.bolstad@uis.no,,"Bolstad, Jorgen/0000-0002-7623-5741",,,,,51,1,1,2,4,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1047-1987,1476-4989,,POLIT ANAL,Polit.

The study's results provide a novel demonstration of the joint contribution of opposing theories to the understanding of meaning multiplicity. Specifically, it found that textual polysemy, partisan selective perception, and the use of strategic ambiguity coalesced in the interpretive dynamics of this story. Based on these results, the article discusses the contribution of DCD to bridging competing approaches and the potential applications of the framework.","[Boxman-Shabtai, Lillian] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Commun & Journalism, Jerusalem, Israel",,"Boxman-Shabtai, L (corresponding author), Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Commun & Journalism, Jerusalem, Israel.",lillyboxman@gmail.com,,,Northwestern's School of Communication,Northwestern's School of Communication,"This article is based on a doctoral dissertation that was conducted at Northwestern University.

This fieldwork demonstrated that the inability to create and share information within and across residents, communities and service providers is a key contributor to social isolation and barrier to local collaboration. MAFN developed a CTP to correlate perceptions that it was difficult to find out what was going on in the neighbourhood, with an exhaustive audit of actual activity. The result was collective surprise at finding out about dozens of events in each area that were previously either poorly communicated or which were not normally published at all, relying entirely on word of mouth. The CTP was developed using a capability model [Kleine (2013). Technologies of choice? ICTs, development, and the capabilities approach.

Many expect that algorithmic filtering and a shift of audiences from legacy media to new intermediaries decrease the diversity of news diets, leading to fragmented societies, polarization and spread of misinformation. Different fields, from journalism research to law and computer science, are involved in the study of media diversity. They operate, however, with vastly different vocabularies, frameworks, and measurements. To overcome this fragmentation, this study provides an extensive overview of conceptualizations and operationalizations of media diversity in different fields using a systematic literature review (1999-2018). This showed a lack of theorizing and linking of conceptual with empirical work in media diversity research. Based on this, we develop a framework on how to move forward: Regarding conceptualization, we call for focusing on different places in the journalistic information chain instead of the classical exposure-supply distinction. Methodologically, automated approaches (e.g., analyzing digital traces) and qualitative approaches (e.g., capturing perceptions of diversity) should receive more attention. For analysis, matters of balance and disparity need to be stressed more, especially discussing possible limits to diversity. Overall, research into media diversity thus needs to be addressed in interdisciplinary collaboration.","[Loecherbach, Felicia; van Atteveldt, Wouter] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Commun, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Moeller, Judith; Trilling, Damian] Univ Amsterdam, Dept Commun, Amsterdam, Netherlands",,"Loecherbach, F (corresponding author), Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Commun, Amsterdam, Netherlands.",f.loecherbach@vu.nl,"Loe, Fe/AEL-6212-2022; Loecherbach, Felicia/AAF-7001-2021; van Atteveldt, Wouter/L-8685-2013","Loecherbach, Felicia/0000-0003-2637-613X; Moeller, Judith/0000-0001-7491-1155; van Atteveldt, Wouter/0000-0003-1237-538X; Trilling, Damian/0000-0002-2586-0352","NWO; eScience center, Joint eScience and Data Science grant [DTEC.2017.014]","NWO(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)); eScience center, Joint eScience and Data Science grant","This work was supported by the NWO and the eScience center, Joint eScience and Data Science grant (DTEC.2017.014).",,233,17,17,7,40,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

This aspect of state capacity and state power is predicated on frequent and dense encounters between the state and the population it seeks to control. We argue that literacy in the language of state administration facilitates state-society interaction by lowering the transaction costs of those encounters. We support this claim with evidence drawing upon detailed historical data from nineteenth-century France during a crucial period of state and nation building. Focusing on the specific domain of French marriage regulations, we find that increasing literacy predicts greater popular involvement with local authorities across French regions over time. These results demonstrate that literacy plays an important role in political development not solely by enhancing loyalty to the state, as the literature has recognized, but also by lowering linguistic and human capital barriers to state-society interaction.","[Zhang, Nan] Max Planck Inst Res Collect Goods, Kurt Schumacher Str 10, D-53113 Bonn, Germany; [Lee, Melissa M.] Princeton Univ, Polit & Int Affairs, 3-S-4 Green Hall, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA",,"Zhang, N (corresponding author), Max Planck Inst Res Collect Goods, Kurt Schumacher Str 10, D-53113 Bonn, Germany.",zhang@coll.mpg.de; melissa.lee@princeton.edu,,,Princeton University's University Committee on Research in the Humanities and Social Sciences,Princeton University's University Committee on Research in the Humanities and Social Sciences,This article is one of several joint articles by the authors.

However, certain manifestations of non-heteronormative sexualities infiltrate public space through convergent traditional and new media (Jenkins, 2006, Convergence Culture. Where Old and New Media Collide. New York University Press) and the performativity of non-heteronormative sexualities in popular culture. This paper claims that these convergent media-enabled representations of NS can challenge, inform, mediate or authenticate the establishment discourse. It focuses on a particular case of a sexually provocative video with homoerotic undertones (mimicking a popular music hit 'Satisfaction') produced by male cadets from the Ulyanovsk Institute of Civil Aviation and uploaded onto YouTube in January 2018 (allegedly without the cadets' permission). The paper examines its mediation from the grassroots to semi-official peripheries, to mainstream media (TV) and back again (focus group data), highlighting a dramatic change in the official coverage as well as a lack of hegemonic consensus regarding representations of non-heteronormative sexualities.","[Miazhevich, Galina] Cardiff Univ, Sch Journalism Media & Culture, Cardiff, Wales",,"Miazhevich, G (corresponding author), Cardiff Univ, JOMEC, 2 Cent Sq, Cardiff CF10 1FS, Wales.",MiazhevichG@cardiff.ac.uk,,"Miazhevich, Galina/0000-0001-9233-7097",Arts and Humanities Research Council [AH/R00143X/1]; AHRC [AH/R00143X/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Arts and Humanities Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Arts & Humanities Research Council (AHRC)); AHRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Arts & Humanities Research Council (AHRC)),This work was supported by Arts and Humanities Research Council [Grant number AH/R00143X/1].,,38,0,0,2,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

J,"Au, AS",,,,"Au, Anson",,,Guanxi 2.0: the exchange of likes in social networking sites,INFORMATION COMMUNICATION & SOCIETY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Guanxi; China; social networking sites; online communication; likes,CONSTRUCTION; INFORMATION; DIRECTIONS,"Few studies have examined how non-verbal functions are implicated in online communication and in non-Western contexts. Addressing these lacunae, this article analyzes interviews with Hong Kong youth to interrogate how likes are exchanged in online interactions within the context of guanxi. This article discovers that likes are reimagined as a digital gift of renqing representing targeted attention from specific giver-identities that generates circuits of likes exchanged between participants for tie-maintenance and tie-formation. For weak ties, lower frequency of reciprocity and sense of obligation were reported, whereas strong ties engendered reports of higher frequency of reciprocity and sense of obligation. However, across all dyadic guanxi ties, participants felt a constant renqing debt demanding repayment. As such, participants felt the need for some baseline frequency of like exchange and offended when alters neglected reciprocity altogether, yet continued giving likes for fear of damaging their reputation and relationship. Thus, mianzi is reconceptualized as embedded in interpersonal evaluations of one's reputation based on how well they maintain relationships and bound up in the social interactive tendency to exchange renqing over time. These webs of meaning and exchange encircle the objective of maintaining relationships by invigorating their emotional content. Here, the non-verbality of likes deepened their ability to replicate the raw, emotive charge of renqing: stripped of the burdensome complexities of verbal communication, likes convey a simple, one-dimensional, powerful sentiment of agreement that, in participants' experiences, is useful to generating future exchanges of likes and improving online relationships enough to create relationships offline as well.","[Au, Anson] Univ Toronto, Dept Sociol, Toronto, ON M5S 2J4, Canada",,"Au, AS (corresponding author), Univ Toronto, Dept Sociol, Toronto, ON M5S 2J4, Canada.",anson.au@mail.utoronto.ca,"Au, Anson/AAE-7772-2019","Au, Anson/0000-0002-8180-5104",,,,,53,2,2,6,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

J,"Albury, NJ",,,,"Albury, Nathan John",,,Multilingualism and Mobility as Collateral Results of Hegemonic Language Policy,APPLIED LINGUISTICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,MALAYSIA; ISLAMISATION; LINGUISTICS,"This article shows, with Malaysia as a case study, that an ethnonationalist language policy need not have disempowering consequences for minorities. Malaysia politicizes ethnic difference between Malaysians of Malay, Chinese, and Indian descent. Ethnic Malays enjoy economic concessions unavailable to others, law defines Malaysia as Islamic and speaking Bahasa, and Malay ethno-nationalism constructs Chinese- and Indian-Malaysians as perpetual visitors. Nonetheless, Bahasa has only added to the multilingual repertoires of non-Malays, rather than replaced it. This article analyses survey data about the multilingual practices of Malaysian youth and their folk linguistic talk about what guides their multilingualism. By drawing on critical language policy, it appears that policy may be so ethnonationalist that it has caused disassociation, especially amongst Indian-Malaysians, and sustained multilingualism. The Chinese-Malaysian experience, however, is better explained by a posthumanist perspective whereby language choices appear guided by material and immaterial resources within the Chinese-Malaysian community, rather than by matters of power or politics. In any case, the relative greater multilingualism of Chinese-and Indian-Malaysians was perceived as empowering non-Malay mobility despite ethnonationalist policy.","[Albury, Nathan John] Leiden Univ, Ctr Linguist, Leiden, Netherlands",,"Albury, NJ (corresponding author), Leiden Univ, Ctr Linguist, Leiden, Netherlands.",n.j.albury@hum.leidenuniv.nl,,,European Union [707404],European Union(European Commission),This project has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie grant agreement No 707404.,,57,2,2,5,19,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0142-6001,1477-450X,,APPL LINGUIST,Appl.

Websleuthing, or the investigative practices undertaken online by individuals who are not professional security providers, is an increasing trend. While conducting investigations on Reddit constitutes somewhat of a transgressive practice, the online platform's history is intimately linked with websleuthing since the manhunt that followed the 2013 Boston attacks which received much criticism from its community. Thus, we seek to understand how the RBI organizes its investigative activities against an anti-vigilante backdrop. Drawing from organizational discourse theory, we analyze the discursive practices developed by RBI members to define and enforce the collective's mission and participatory guidelines. Specifically, we focus on the figures (memes, metaphors, rules, affects, etc.) that RBI members invoke in interaction and on the role of Reddit's affordances in the materialization of these discursive entities. Our analysis is threefold. First, we underline how figures associated with retributive vigilantism are invoked by moderators and their propension to circumscribe what (not) to do within the subreddit. Then, we analyze a series of controversial posts to identify the recurring discursive practices developed by users when asking the RBI for assistance. Finally, we explore the ambivalent rapport that RBI members maintain with the police. Overall, our analysis shows that members must overtly recognize police authority over criminal matters yet invoke the institution's limitations to justify their involvement in the RBI, all the while rejecting any association with retributive vigilantism.","[Myles, David; Benoit-Barne, Chantal] Univ Montreal, Departement Commun, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Millerand, Florence] Univ Quebec Montreal, Departement Commun sociale publ, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Myles, David] Univ Montreal, Centre,CONTACT,David Myles,Departement Commun, Pavillon Marie,Victorin,FAS Case postale 6128, succ, Montreal, PQ, Canada",,"Myles, D (corresponding author), Univ Montreal, Departement Commun, Montreal, PQ, Canada.;Myles, D (corresponding author), Univ Montreal, Centre,CONTACT,David Myles,Departement Commun, Pavillon Marie,Victorin,FAS Case postale 6128, succ, Montreal, PQ, Canada.",david.myles@umontreal.ca,,,,,,,41,8,8,6,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

This article offers insight into how journalists and political professionals construct practices of data campaigning as all-powerful despite the limited empirical findings to that effect. Specifically, this research delves into how journalistic coverage of campaigns' use of data and analytics has often relied on inflated accounts of the objectivity of analytics, the belief that more data necessarily means more and better knowledge, and narratives of objective outsiders - notably geeks, hackers, nerds, and scientists - that situate analytics staffers as strange and different, and as uniquely qualified to access the truth. To do this, I engage in critical discourse analysis of popular coverage of data campaigning in the US in the years 2008-2016. Ultimately, denaturalizing these narratives helps reveal how they contribute to defining this new campaign strategy as fundamentally concerned with finding objective answers to solvable problems and are key to political professionals' maintenance of organizational power.","[Baldwin-Philippi, Jessica] Fordham Univ, Commun & Media Studies, 441 E Fordham Rd, Bronx, NY 10024 USA",,"Baldwin-Philippi, J (corresponding author), Fordham Univ, Commun & Media Studies, 441 E Fordham Rd, Bronx, NY 10024 USA.",jphilippi@fordham.edu,,,,,,,92,4,4,1,3,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1058-4609,1091-7675,,POLIT COMMUN,Polit.

We find that seeing articles about non-immigration politics in Spanish, as an option next to English articles, significantly raises racial resentment toward Hispanics among Whites. Among Spanish-speaking Latinos, seeing a political news article option in Spanish increases feelings of inclusion and belonging, even when it is not about a racialized issue like immigration.

Drawing on House (2017) and Pym (2010), it shows how the translation of experience takes place on three levels: the overt level of linguistic equivalence; the covert level of functional equivalence through a cultural filter; and the level of a cultural translation that has to be negotiated according to the subjective needs of the participants. These studies reveal that native language teachers tend to prefer overt over covert translations and that they engage in cultural translation not in order to explore but in order to overcome cultural difference. Such findings confront the field of applied linguistics with its age-old challenge as a field called to translate real-world problems of the practice into the language of research and vice-versa.","[Kramsch, Claire] Univ Calif Berkeley, 1201 Shattuck Ave, Berkeley, CA 94709 USA",,"Kramsch, C (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, 1201 Shattuck Ave, Berkeley, CA 94709 USA.",ckramsch@berkeley.edu,,,,,,,30,4,4,7,32,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0142-6001,1477-450X,,APPL LINGUIST,Appl.

We find that training only improved economic livelihoods modestly and had little effect on combatant support. Cash failed to lift incomes, producing a boom-and-bust dynamic in which pro-government sentiment initially spiked and then quickly reversed itself, leaving a residue of increased Taliban support. Conditional on training, cash failed to improve beneficiaries' livelihoods but did increase support for the Afghan government for at least eight months after the intervention. These findings suggest that aid affects attitudes by providing information about government resolve and competence rather than by improving economic livelihoods.","[Lyall, Jason] Dartmouth Coll, Dept Govt, Transnat Studies, Hanover, NH 03755 USA; [Zhou, Yang-Yang] Univ British Columbia, Dept Polit Sci, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Imai, Kosuke] Harvard Univ, Dept Govt, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Imai, Kosuke] Harvard Univ, Dept Stat, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",,"Lyall, J (corresponding author), Dartmouth Coll, Dept Govt, Transnat Studies, Hanover, NH 03755 USA.",jason.lyall@dartmouth.edu; yangyang.zhou@ubc.ca; imai@harvard.edu,"Imai, Kosuke/B-7462-2008","Imai, Kosuke/0000-0002-2748-1022; Zhou, Yang-Yang/0000-0003-0309-4252; Lyall, Jason/0000-0001-9117-7503",Air Force Office of Scientific Research [FA9550-14-1-0072]; United States Institute for Peace [SG-446-15]; National Science Foundation [SES.1148900],Air Force Office of Scientific Research(United States Department of DefenseAir Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR)); United States Institute for Peace; National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"Lyall acknowledges financial support from the Air Force Office of Scientific Research (#FA9550-14-1-0072) and the United States Institute for Peace (#SG-446-15).

J,"Sultan, NS",,,,"Sultan, Nazmul S.",,,Self-Rule and the Problem of Peoplehood in Colonial India,AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,,GANDHI; DEMOCRACY,"This article theorizes the colonial problem of peoplehood that Indian anticolonial thinkers grappled with in their attempts to conceptualize self-rule, or swaraj. British colonial rule drew its legitimacy from a developmentalist conception of the colonized people as backward and disunited. The discourse of underdeveloped colonial peoplehood rendered the Indian people unfit for self-government, suspending their sovereignty to an indefinite future. The concept of swaraj would be born with the rejection of deferred colonial self-government. Yet the persistence of the developmentalist figuration of the people generated a crisis of sovereign authorization. The pre-Gandhian swaraj theorists would be faced with the not-yet claimable figure of the people at the very moment of disavowing the British claim to rule. Recovering this underappreciated pre-Gandhian history of the concept of swaraj and reinterpreting its Gandhian moment, this article offers a new reading of Gandhi's theory of moral self-rule. In so doing, it demonstrates how the history of swaraj helps trace the colonial career of popular sovereignty.","[Sultan, Nazmul S.] Univ Chicago, Dept Polit Sci, Chicago, IL 60637 USA",,"Sultan, NS (corresponding author), Univ Chicago, Dept Polit Sci, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",nazmulsultan@uchicago.edu,,"Sultan, Nazmul/0000-0002-7850-9400",,,,,98,6,6,2,10,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0003-0554,1537-5943,,AM POLIT SCI REV,Am.

We apply the conceptual framework to study the case of Midia NINJA, a Brazilian alternative media that gained popularity due to its innovative coverage of the 2013 riots in the country through collaborative practices and digital media technologies. Based on interviews and participant observation, we found that policy discourses to change the media structure influenced in time the discourse and practices of this alternative media in Brazil, leading to new uses of digital media technologies unintended by its designers.

These data-driven practices, and associated values, have become aspirational to other organizations. However, there are growing concerns that data practices reinforce the decision-making power of the data collector at the expense of the rights of the data subject. This research considers how traditional membership organizations adapt to these new data-driven practices, while addressing these concerns. This paper demonstrates how the political communication theory of the trustee, delegate, and responsible leadership models resolves the tension in the discourse surrounding data practices by exploring the positives and negatives of both decentralized decision-making and centralized decision-making. The framework is then explored in practice through an ethnographic case study of Amnesty International. The results show how the use of data to be people-powered is a powerful discourse, but ultimately new data practices are only used to centralize power, as is purported by critical literature.","[Macintyre, Amber] Royal Holloway Univ London, Polit & Int Relat, Egham, Surrey, England",,"Macintyre, A (corresponding author), Royal Holloway Univ London, Polit & Int Relat, Egham, Surrey, England.",amber.macintyre@gmail.com,,,Leverhulme Trust,Leverhulme Trust(Leverhulme Trust),This work was supported by the Leverhulme Trust.,,32,2,2,1,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1933-1681,1933-169X,,J INF TECHNOL POLITI,J.

The article explores the linguistic (especially phonetic), sequential and embodied resources available to participants to make sense of such clicks. It is argued that some clicks have properties of linguistic organization: They have nonarbitrary form-meaning mappings. Other clicks by contrast are interpreted more as ad hoc, singular events.

To compute similarities in web use between countries, we utilized an algorithm that considered both ranking positions and overlap counts on ranked lists of the 100 most popular websites for 174 countries, totaling 6,252 unique websites. Findings from a network analysis and from regressions suggest that countries with similar languages and shared borders, as well as those vastly different in their Internet market sizes, tend to have similar web use patterns.

The Perspective of Linguistic Laypersons,APPLIED LINGUISTICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,SPEAKING; PROFICIENCY; PERFORMANCE,"Applied linguists have developed complex theories of the ability to communicate in a second language (L2). However, the perspectives on L2 communication ability of speakers who are not trained language professionals have been incorporated neither into theories of communication ability nor in the criteria for assessing performance on general-purpose oral proficiency tests. This potentially weakens the validity of such tests because the ultimate arbiters of L2 speakers' oral performance are not trained language professionals. This study investigates the perspectives of these linguistic laypersons on L2 communication ability. Twenty-three native and non-native English-speaking linguistic laypersons judged L2 speakers' oral performances and verbalized the reasons for their judgments. The results showed that the participants focus not only on the linguistic aspects of the speaker's output but also on features that applied linguists have less paid attention to. Even where speaker's linguistic errors were acknowledged, message conveyance and comprehensibility of the message contributed to their judgment. The study has implications for language testing and the development of tests reflecting the construct of English as a lingua franca.","[Sato, Takanori] Sophia Univ, Tokyo, Japan; [McNamara, Tim] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",,"Sato, T (corresponding author), Sophia Univ, Tokyo, Japan.",taka-sato@sophia.ac.jp,,"Sato, Takanori/0000-0003-1483-966X",TOEFL Small Grants for Doctoral Research in Second or Foreign Language Assessment from Educational Testing Service,TOEFL Small Grants for Doctoral Research in Second or Foreign Language Assessment from Educational Testing Service,This study was supported by the TOEFL Small Grants for Doctoral Research in Second or Foreign Language Assessment from Educational Testing Service.,,39,8,8,1,27,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0142-6001,1477-450X,,APPL LINGUIST,Appl.

The bulk of the research has focused on professional white-collar workplaces, but a handful of studies have examined working-class settings such as factories and building sites. This area of research has, however, been concerned with interactions involving co-workers. Studies examining interactions between newcomers and experienced others, such as Holmes and Woodhams (2013), are rare. Using data collected in the working-class setting of the professional kitchen, the current study presents interactions between newcomer trainee cooks and the cooks they worked under. It focuses on the use of directives, which was a prevalent feature of their interactions. As individual utterances, the directives would seem to be designed to elicit specific, ad-hoc actions from trainees. However, closer analysis reveals that series of directives may serve important instructional purposes. Findings from the study are useful in raising the awareness of those assigned to mentor trainees in work settings and should enhance on-the-job workplace training as well as support newcomers as they adjust to their new workplaces.","[Pang, Priscilla] Singapore Univ Social Sci, 463 Clementi Rd, Singapore 599494, Singapore",,"Pang, P (corresponding author), Singapore Univ Social Sci, 463 Clementi Rd, Singapore 599494, Singapore.",priscillapangyn@suss.edu.sg,,"Pang, Priscilla/0000-0003-3650-7682",,,,,52,1,1,2,13,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0142-6001,1477-450X,,APPL LINGUIST,Appl.

Herein, we ask two questions: First, to what extent do Latinos perceive and experience discrimination? Second, to what extent do immigration status, generational status, and language use moderate beliefs about discrimination? Using Pew National Survey of Latinos data, we find that Latino beliefs about the problem of discrimination is a decreasing function of proximity to the canonical immigrant-defined here as first-generation immigrants who are Spanish-language dominant. Further, we demonstrate that reported rates of victimization due to discrimination exhibit no clear pattern and are flat over time. We conclude by demonstrating that discrimination beliefs have significant implications for systemic trust, anxiety, and policy preferences.","[Jones, Bradford; Vannette, David] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Polit Sci, 1 Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Victor, Kristina Flores] Calif State Univ Sacramento, Dept Polit Sci, Sacramento, CA 95819 USA; [Vannette, David] Univ Calif Davis, Qualtr Methodol Lab, 1 Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA",,"Jones, B (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Dept Polit Sci, 1 Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",bsjjones@ucdavis.edu; kristinam.victor@gmail.com; dave.vannette@gmail.com,,,,,,,38,9,9,0,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0092-5853,1540-5907,,AM J POLIT SCI,Am.

By treating journalistic objectivity not as a stable referent, but as a contextual one prone to shifts in practices and understandings over time, it foregrounds how changing technologies of recording, creating, and distributing news content affect how journalistic objectivity is understood. Following this perspective, two technological practices are examined: photojournalism and algorithms. The development of photojournalism led to the prizing of news images as objective representations produced by the camera to the diminishment of human judgment. Similarly, the various outputs produced by news algorithms are accompanied by an orientation toward computational objectivity in contrast to human subjectivity. Exploring these dynamics sheds light on the ongoing relationship between news technologies and discourses of journalistic objectivity in the face of digital innovations in the production and circulation of news.","[Carlson, Matt] Univ Minnesota, Hubbard Sch Journalism & Mass Commun, Minneapolis, MN USA",,"Carlson, M (corresponding author), Univ Minnesota, 111 Murphy Hall,206 Church St SE, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.",carlson1@umn.edu,,,,,,,85,21,21,5,25,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

It complements and extends previous conceptualizations in research on alternative media and outlines an umbrella definition of this phenomenon aimed to inspire contemporary research and scholarly debate. Previous research has been guided by a progressive perspective as a form of resistance against bourgeois hegemonic discourse. Such normative evaluations have in turn limited how the phenomenon has been studied empirically, by limiting the scope of research so that important contemporary phenomena fall outside the theoretical map. Conceptualizing alternative news media in the present hybrid and polarized media environment, we first propose a non-normative, multilevel relational definition: Alternative news media position themselves as correctives of the mainstream news media, as expressed in editorial agendas or statements and/or are perceived as such by their audiences or third-parties. This counter-hegemonic alternativeness can emerge on the macro-level of societal function, the meso-level of organizations and/or the micro-level of news content and producers. Second, demonstrating why this umbrella definition is fruitful in the changing media environment characterized by boundary struggles, crisis in legacy news media and mushrooming of alternative news outlets, we highlight research gaps and propose future research.","[Holt, Kristoffer] Gulf Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Mass Commun & Media MCM, Kuwait, Kuwait; [Figenschou, Tine Ustad] Oslo Metropolitan Univ, Dept Journalism & Media Studies, Oslo, Norway; [Frischlich, Lena] Univ Munster, Dept Commun, Munster, Germany",,"Holt, K (corresponding author), Gulf Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Mass Commun & Media MCM, Kuwait, Kuwait.",Holt.A@gust.edu.kw,"Frischlich, Lena/U-7842-2019; Holt, Kristoffer/G-5575-2019; Holt, Kristoffer/S-9693-2019","Frischlich, Lena/0000-0001-5039-5301; Holt, Kristoffer/0000-0003-2017-1117; Holt, Kristoffer/0000-0003-2017-1117",,,,,26,96,96,16,28,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

Decolonial thinkers often invoke pre-colonial traditions in their efforts to fashion national cultures- modes of being, understanding, and self-expression specific to a de-colonizing collectivity's experience. While the substantive contributions of precolonial traditions to decolonial thought have received well-deserved attention in postcolonial and comparative political theory, this paper focuses on the role that interpretive methods play in generating the emancipatory sensibilities envisioned by decolonial thinkers. It draws on the contemporary Moroccan philosopher Mohammed 'Abed Al-Jabri's interpretive method to show that its decolonial potential lies in its reader-centric approach. This approach is concerned with transforming its postcolonial reader's relationship to precolonial traditions, and not only with establishing the truth of historical texts or making use of their insights in the present as is more common in political-theoretical modes of interpretation. It does so through a tripartite process of disconnection, reconnection, and praxis.","[Daifallah, Yasmeen] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Polit Sci, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA",,"Daifallah, Y (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Polit Sci, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA.",ydaifall@ucsc.edu,,"Daifallah, Yasmeen/0000-0002-7417-8616",,,,,75,1,2,0,4,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0003-0554,1537-5943,,AM POLIT SCI REV,Am.

The grammar is made explicit in 22 'Analyses', grouped into five main categories. It includes discussion around the process of mapping meaning on to pattern, the consideration of borderline cases, and the debate around naming of elements. This contributes to a comparison of different approaches to phraseology, and in particular to the place of Construction Grammar in relation to more output-oriented approaches.

The activity involved a three-part pedagogical structure, where learners first prepared for and then participated in real-life service encounters, and later reflected on their experiences back in the classroom. The analysis details how the co-constructed telling sequences through which novice second language users re-enact their experiences create an occasion for language-focused activity. We argue that the actions through which the participants display and sustain an orientation to an interactional practice as an object of learning make visible a learning project. The findings illuminate the practices through which language-focused activity is initiated, sustained, and managed to enable in situ learning. They also show how re-enactments function in storytelling and display a novice learner's interactional competence. Finally, the findings illustrate how experiences gained in everyday social activities can be 'harvested and reflected upon' (Wagner 2015: 77) in the classroom and contribute to recent initiatives to develop teaching practices that support learning in-the-wild.","[Lilja, Niina] Univ Tampere, Tampere 33014, Finland; [Piirainen-Marsh, Arja] Univ Jyvaskyla, Dept Languages, English, Jyvaskyla, Finland",,"Lilja, N (corresponding author), Univ Tampere, Tampere 33014, Finland.",niina.lilja@uta.fi,"ARSLAN, Okan/AAA-3232-2020","Piirainen-Marsh, Arja/0000-0001-9898-3444; Lilja, Niina/0000-0003-0360-1584",,,,,61,5,5,1,18,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0142-6001,1477-450X,,APPL LINGUIST,Appl.

This article considers this question in light of a recently developed view that criminal disenfranchisement is justified because it expresses our commitment to democratic values. We call this view expressive disenfranchisement and refer to the general conception in which it is grounded as democratic expressivism. Contra supporters of expressive disenfranchisement, we argue that democratic expressivism does not offer a sound justification of criminal disenfranchisement. Additionally, we argue that, insofar as one really cares about answering serious criminal wrongs via an expression of democratic values, criminal disenfranchisement should be abandoned and replaced with a policy that temporarily obliges the relevant criminals to vote. Democratic expressivists should, in other words, move from supporting the disenfranchisement of serious offenders to endorsing a policy of compulsory criminal voting for a finite period of time.","[Poama, Andrei] Leiden Univ, Fac Governance & Global Affairs, Leiden, Netherlands; [Theuns, Tom] Univ Utrecht, Utrecht, Netherlands; [Theuns, Tom] Univ Coll Roosevelt, Middelburg, Netherlands; [Theuns, Tom] Sci Po Paris, Ctr European Studies & Comparat Polit, Paris, France",,"Poama, A (corresponding author), Leiden Univ, Fac Governance & Global Affairs, Leiden, Netherlands.",a.poama@fgga.leidenuniv.nl; t.j.h.theuns@uu.nl,,"Theuns, Tom/0000-0002-8838-3397",European Union [727112],European Union(European Commission),Tom Theuns would like to acknowledge funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under grant agreement No. 727112 since February 2018.,,62,4,4,0,2,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0003-0554,1537-5943,,AM POLIT SCI REV,Am.

Most studies dealing with political text consider how such texts communicate content, rather than the structural characteristics of texts themselves. The current study focuses on complexity as one of the focal structural characteristics of political text. Previous research showed that different types of textual complexity affect learning processes. Such prior studies are, however, limited both conceptually and empirically. This study addresses these gaps by employing a large-scale experimental design (N= 822), investigating how different dimensions of textual complexity affect factual and structural political knowledge, and whether such relationships are mediated through perceived complexity. Results indicate that different levels (high vs. low) and different dimensions of textual complexity (semantic vs. syntactic) influence reader's perception of text, as well as their factual and structural knowledge. Only semantic complexity has an effect on one's perceived complexity, which in turn negatively affects factual and structural knowledge. Syntactic complexity directly lowered one's factual knowledge acquisition, while there was no direct effect of syntactic complexity on structural knowledge. The results suggest that text complexity indeed plays an important role in political information acquisition, and our findings also highlight the importance of perception in mediating the structural effects of the text.","[Tolochko, Petro] Univ Vienna, Dept Polit Sci, Vienna, Austria; [Song, Hyunjin] Univ Vienna, Dept Commun, Rathausstr 19-1-9, A-1010 Vienna, Austria; [Boomgaarden, Hajo] Univ Vienna, Dept Commun, Empir Social Sci Methods Focus Text Anal, Vienna, Austria",,"Tolochko, P (corresponding author), Univ Vienna, Dept Commun, Rathausstr 19-1-9, A-1010 Vienna, Austria.",petro.tolochko@univie.ac.at,,"Boomgaarden, Hajo G./0000-0002-5260-1284; Tolochko, Petro/0000-0001-5971-8816",,,,,59,7,7,1,9,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1058-4609,1091-7675,,POLIT COMMUN,Polit.

A study was conducted of the effects of progressive increases in the complexity (operationalized as number of elements) of three versions of each of three tasks on the syntactic complexity and lexical diversity of the speech of 42 English native speakers. Data on native speaker performance are important because they reveal task complexity effects unfiltered by non-native competence. Independent evidence that greater task complexity increased cognitive load was shown by participant self-ratings of perceived difficulty, mental effort, and stress, shorter prospective duration estimates and, using dual-task methodology, slower reaction times. Mid-complex versions of the three tasks elicited the most complex syntactic structures, and the most complex versions elicited the greatest lexical diversity.

Our approach yields predictions that are statistically and practically significant and robust to including a range of controls; in turn, this suggests that subconscious vocal inflections carry information that legal, political, and textual information do not.","[Dietrich, Bryce J.] Univ Iowa, Dept Polit Sci, 341 Schaeffer Hall, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA; [Enos, Ryan D.] Harvard Univ, Dept Govt, 1737 Cambridge St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Sen, Maya] Harvard Univ, John F Kennedy Sch Govt, 79 John F Kennedy St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",,"Dietrich, BJ (corresponding author), Univ Iowa, Dept Polit Sci, 341 Schaeffer Hall, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA.",bryce-dietrich@uiowa.edu; renos@gov.harvard.edu; maya_sen@hks.harvard.edu,,,,,,,16,16,16,3,5,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1047-1987,1476-4989,,POLIT ANAL,Polit.

This study examines how gender inequalities in evaluations depend on the design of the tools used to judge merit. Exploiting a quasi-natural experiment at a large North American university, we found that the number of scale points used in faculty teaching evaluations-whether instructors were rated on a scale of 6 versus a scale of 10-significantly affected the size of the gender gap in evaluations in the most male-dominated fields. A survey experiment, which presented all participants with an identical lecture transcript but randomly varied instructor gender and the number of scale points, replicated this finding and suggested that the number of scale points affects the extent to which gender stereotypes of brilliance are expressed in quantitative ratings. These results highlight how seemingly minor technical aspects of performance ratings can have a major effect on the evaluation of men and women. Our findings thus contribute to a growing body of work on organizational practices that reduce workplace inequalities and the sociological literature on how rating systems-rather than being neutral instruments-shape the distribution of rewards in organizations.","[Rivera, Lauren A.] Northwestern Univ, Kellogg Sch Management, Management & Org & Sociol, Evanston, IL USA; [Tilcsik, Andras] Univ Toronto, Rotman Sch Management, Strateg Management, Toronto, ON, Canada",,"Rivera, LA (corresponding author), Northwestern Univ, 2211 Campus Dr, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",l-rivera@kellogg.northwestern.edu,,,Institute for Gender and the Economy at the University of Toronto; Michael Lee-Chin Family Institute for Corporate Citizenship,Institute for Gender and the Economy at the University of Toronto; Michael Lee-Chin Family Institute for Corporate Citizenship,"Both authors contributed equally to the work and their names are listed alphabetically.

Twenty-six native speakers of English who were novice learners of Spanish completed two L2 production tasks five times and an English production task once, designed to ascertain the frequency with which they prevoiced English voiced stops. Growth curve modeling revealed that linear and quadratic functions most accurately captured participants' L2 VOT development insofar as more gains occurred during the first half of the study. Speakers' propensity to prevoice in the native language also predicted prevoicing in L2 Spanish/b/.

However, despite the large amount of research on ER, there is still a lack of studies that show how or whether students accomplish learning during ER activities. To begin to fill this gap, this study applies a conversation analytic lens to investigate cases of local L2 learning and linguistic development during ER book club interactions. The analysis of the selected excerpts shows how the participants themselves shift the interactional focus from book talk to a lexical item during talk-in-interaction (i.e. orientation to learning), and how they deploy the learning object in subsequent speech events (i.e. short-term development). The analysis also shows how the participants orient to emergent learning objects from several different angles (e.g. pronunciation, meaning, spelling, and morphological form).","[Ro, Eunseok] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Second Language Studies, PhD Program, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA",,"Ro, E (corresponding author), Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Second Language Studies, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.",eunseokr@hawaii.edu,,"RO, Eunseok/0000-0002-7914-7704",,,,,63,7,7,1,39,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0142-6001,1477-450X,,APPL LINGUIST,Appl.

Traditionally, research on the linguistic abilities of persons with dementia is either observational (reports kept by caregivers) or experimental (e.g. based on comprehension tasks), and the focus is not on the syntactic competence of the speaker. We combine insights from corpus-based syntactic analysis with methods from interactional approaches. Our close syntactic analysis of the talk of 20 persons diagnosed with dementia and their non-impaired co-participants document both grammatical accuracy and the range of linguistic complexity produced as compared to patterns reported in studies of non-impaired speakers. We note the selection of complex grammatical structures (i.e. verbal arguments) is largely a consequence of the interaction rather than evidence of linguistic decrement. We report on the most pertinent of these interactional influences. Our findings support strategies that promote complex linguistic and interactional talk with persons diagnosed with dementia. We believe that these strategies will help increase the interactional opportunities that are lacking as reported by and about persons residing in an assisted living facility (Brooker 2011).","[Stickle, Trini] Western Kentucky Univ, English, Bowling Green, KY 42101 USA; [Wanner, Anja] Univ Wisconsin, English Linguist, Madison, WI 53706 USA",,"Stickle, T (corresponding author), Western Kentucky Univ, Dept English, 1906 Coll Hts Blvd 11086, Bowling Green, KY 42101 USA.",trini.stickle@wku.edu; awanner@wisc.edu,,,Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research and Graduate Education at the University of Wisconsin-Madison; Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation [140192],Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research and Graduate Education at the University of Wisconsin-Madison; Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation,The authors would like to thank the audience at the 3rd Conference of the International Society for the Linguistics of English for valuable feedback and the Carolina Conversation Collection's team for giving us access to their corpus.

While many scholars address this problem from a purely techno-centric perspective, others try to raise broader social justice concerns. In this article, we join those voices and examine norms, values, and practices among European civil society organizations in relation to the topic of data and discrimination. Our goal is to decenter technology and bring nuance into the debate about its role and place in the production of social inequalities. To accomplish this, we rely on Nancy Fraser's theory of abnormal justice which highlights interconnections between maldistribution of economic benefits, misrecognition of marginalized communities, and their misrepresentation in political processes. Fraser's theory helps situate technologically mediated discrimination alongside other more conventional kinds of discrimination and injustice and privileges attention to economic, social, and political conditions of marginality. Using a thematic analysis of 30 interviews with civil society representatives across Europe's human rights sector, we bring clarity to this idea of decentering. We show how many groups prioritize the specific experiences of marginalized groups and see through' technology, acknowledging its connection to larger systems of institutionalized oppression. This decentered approach contrasts the process-oriented perspective of tech-savvy civil society groups that shy from an analysis of systematic forms of injustice.","[Gangadharan, Seeta Pena; Niklas, Jedrzej] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Media & Commun, London, England",,"Gangadharan, SP (corresponding author), London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Media & Commun, London, England.",s.p.gangadharan@lse.ac.uk; j.niklas@lse.ac.uk,,"Niklas, Jedrzej/0000-0003-2878-3134",Open Society Foundations,Open Society Foundations,This work was supported by Open Society Foundations.,,47,29,29,1,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

The paper's central claim is that microsociology cannot avoid engaging material turn theory. It will be argued that contemporary attempts to reconceptualize classical microsociological frameworks set out on a path that invariably leads to problems investigated by thinkers like Latour: as communication technology advances, the importance of mediated interaction grows, prompting attempts to update interactionism for non-face-to-face interactions such as teleconferencing, social networks and virtual reality. These new social situations are then made sense of in terms of the way these technologies have a transformative effect on interaction. This effect be it a modifier of the temporal structure of the interaction, or of the interactional capacity of the agents is argued to always lead back to a central question of the material turn: if technology is a static transformational effect, where is its agency? Or, conversely: if a technological object's effect is uniform across all external factors, how is that not a form of technological determinism? The paper investigates whether attempts to avoid determinism manage to keep Latourian metaphysics at bay. The paper concludes by suggesting that contemporary social theory must work towards a middle way that does not gloss over important contributions of material turn theorists whilst also not ignoring the importance of considering human political responsibility.","[Klowait, Nils Oliver] Moscow Sch Social & Econ Sci, Int Ctr Contemporary Social Theory, 82-2 Vernadskogo Av, Moscow 119571, Russia; [Klowait, Nils Oliver] Russian Presidential Acad Natl Econ & Publ Adm, Ctr Sociol Res, 82-2 Vernadskogo Av, Moscow 119571, Russia",,"Klowait, NO (corresponding author), Moscow Sch Social & Econ Sci, Int Ctr Contemporary Social Theory, 82-2 Vernadskogo Av, Moscow 119571, Russia.;Klowait, NO (corresponding author), Russian Presidential Acad Natl Econ & Publ Adm, Ctr Sociol Res, 82-2 Vernadskogo Av, Moscow 119571, Russia.",nils.klowait@gmail.com,"Klowait, Nils/ABE-4375-2020","Klowait, Nils/0000-0002-7347-099X",,,,,61,2,3,3,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

This article analyzes attempts to detheorize nationalism, arguing that they serve three major functions. First, they free nationalists from universalizing their arguments and from the ensuing rights and obligations. Second, they allow its rivals to present nationalism as morally inferior to other political standpoints. Third, they lead to the singling out and legitimization of one specific form of nationalism that is principle driven. Drawing a line between forms of nationalism-those motivated by primordial feelings and those motivated by rational and universal principles-lays the groundwork for a distinction between ethnic and civic nationalism. Though in theory these are two distinct forms of nationalism, in reality the boundaries are blurred. And yet advocates of civic nationalism keep the distinction alive, wishing to distance themselves from the other form of nationalism and promoting a vision (some would say the illusion) of a nationless nationalism. Assuming thatWestern democracies have transcended their national and ethnic elements encourages politicians to ignore social schisms, avoiding the need to cope with their consequences. The civic language therefore not only is theoretically inaccurate but also motivates avoidance where action is needed.","[Tamir, Yael (Yuli)] Shenkar Coll, IL-5252626 Ramat Gan, Israel; [Tamir, Yael (Yuli)] Univ Oxford, Blavatnik Sch Govt, Oxford OX2 6GG, England",,"Tamir, Y (corresponding author), Shenkar Coll, IL-5252626 Ramat Gan, Israel.;Tamir, Y (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Blavatnik Sch Govt, Oxford OX2 6GG, England.",yuli@shenkar.ac.il,,,,,,,38,17,18,4,13,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1094-2939,1545-1577,,ANNU REV POLIT SCI,Annu.

This article presents results of a study that focused on the empirical robustness (i.e. the power of level descriptions to capture what learners actually do in a language test) of the CEFR vocabulary & fluency scales (A2-B2). Data stem from an Italian & German oral proficiency test (Abel et al. 2012). Results show that the empirical robustness was flawed: Some scale contents were hardly observable or so evenly distributed that they could not distinguish between learners. Contradictory/weak correlations among scale features and heterogeneous cluster solutions suggest that scales did not consistently capture typical learner behaviour. Often, learner language could not be objectively described by any level description. Also, it was only partially possible to link scale contents to research-based measures of fluency and vocabulary. Given the importance of CEFR levels in many high-stakes contexts, the results suggest the need of a large empirical validation project.","[Wisniewski, Katrin] Univ Leipzig, Herder Inst German Foreign Language, Leipzig, Germany",,"Wisniewski, K (corresponding author), Univ Leipzig, Herder Inst German Foreign Language, Leipzig, Germany.",katrin.wisniewski@uni-leipzig.de,,"Wisniewski, Katrin/0000-0003-4124-2543",,,,,69,6,6,4,33,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0142-6001,1477-450X,,APPL LINGUIST,Appl.

This growing scholarship, however, yet is in need of a more robust theorization and rigorous methodological framework for investigating class-based research inquiries. This article thereby proposes Membership Categorization Analysis (MCA) as one possible approach for examining the participants' endogenous makings of social class in situ. With interview excerpts of mothers discussing an English immersion policy proposal in South Korea, I will demonstrate how MCA can produce an analysis that is empirically grounded in the participants' own categorial knowledge and commonsense reasoning about stratified social structure. Such an approach respecifies social class from being a rigid, abstract, and predetermined construct to a socially constructed category and accomplishment that is made relevant in the participants' methods of practical action.","[Lee, Josephine] Ewha Womans Univ, Dept English Educ, Seoul, South Korea",,"Lee, J (corresponding author), Ewha Womans Univ, Dept English Educ, Seoul, South Korea.",leejosephine@ewha.ac.kr,,"Lee, Josephine/0000-0003-0686-9228",,,,,77,3,3,1,31,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0142-6001,1477-450X,,APPL LINGUIST,Appl.

From proclamations about the death of 'Man' to investigations into enhanced forms of being, from the advent of the Anthropocene (human-induced planetary change) to new forms of materialism and distributed cognition, posthumanism raises significant questions for applied linguistics in terms of our understandings of language, humans, objects, and agency. After reviewing the broad field of post-humanist thought, this paper investigates-through an overview of a series of recent research projects-the notion of repertoire, to show how this can be better understood by stepping out of the humanist constructs of the individual and the community and looking instead at the notion of distributed language and spatial repertoires. The paper concludes by discussing the implications of posthumanism for applied linguistics, in particular the ways we understand language in relation to people, objects, and place.","[Pennycook, Alastair] Univ Technol Sydney, Fac Arts & Social Sci, Sydney, NSW, Australia",,"Pennycook, A (corresponding author), Univ Technol Sydney, Fac Arts & Social Sci, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",Alastair.pennycook@uts.edu.au,,"Pennycook, Alastair/0000-0002-4656-6187",,,,,76,99,103,17,60,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0142-6001,1477-450X,,APPL LINGUIST,Appl.

In other words, religion and secularism are a consequence as well as a cause of politics. In showing this, we make three major contributions. First, we conceptualize and measure secular orientations in a new way-not just as the absence of religion, but also as an affirmative secular identity and positive commitment to secular principles. Second, our panel and experimental data allow for the most definitive test to date of whether political orientations exert a causal effect on religious and secular orientations. Third, we isolate the conditions under which politics affects religious-secular perspectives, thus identifying the mechanism that underlies political orientations.","[Campbell, David E.] Univ Notre Dame, Amer Democracy, 2060 Jenkins Nanovic Halls, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA; [Layman, Geoffrey C.] Univ Notre Dame, Polit Sci, 2060 Jenkins Nanovic Halls, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA; [Green, John C.] Univ Akron, Polit Sci, 325 Olin Hall, Akron, OH 44325 USA; [Sumaktoyo, Nathanael G.] Univ Notre Dame, Global Relig Res Initiat, 4020 Jenkins Nanovic Halls,Jenkins Hall, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA",,"Campbell, DE (corresponding author), Univ Notre Dame, Amer Democracy, 2060 Jenkins Nanovic Halls, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA.",dave_campbell@nd.edu; glayman@nd.edu; green@uakron.edu; nsumakto@nd.edu,,"Sumaktoyo, Nathanael/0000-0002-7932-3691",National Science Foundation [SES-0961700],National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"This research was supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. SES-0961700.

I argue that this occurs for two reasons, and provide resolutions for each. First, computational models generally do not employ the language or modes of analysis common to game-theoretic models, the status quo in the literature. I detail the types of insights typically derived from game-theoretic models and discuss analogues in computational modeling. Second, there are not widely established procedures for analysis of deductive computational models. I present a regularized method for deriving comparative statics from computational models that provides insights comparable to those arising from game-theoretic analyses. It also serves as a framework for building theoretically tractable computational models. Together, these contributions should enhance communication between models of social science and open up the tool kit of deductive computational modeling for theory building to a broader audience.","[Siegel, David A.] Duke Univ, Dept Polit Sci, 294H Gross Hall,140 Sci Dr, Durham, NC 27708 USA",,"Siegel, DA (corresponding author), Duke Univ, Dept Polit Sci, 294H Gross Hall,140 Sci Dr, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",david.siegel@duke.edu,,,,,,,24,1,5,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0092-5853,1540-5907,,AM J POLIT SCI,Am.

Based on a social identity approach as well as on collectivistic leadership theories, we distinguish between implicit (i.e., First-Person Plural pronouns) and explicit (i.e., invitations and appreciations) inclusive leader language and test its effects on voice in multi-professional teams. We hypothesized that implicit inclusive leader language promotes voice especially among team members sharing the same professional group membership as the leader (in-group team members) while explicit inclusive leader language promotes voice especially among team members belonging to a different professional group (out-group team members). These hypotheses were tested in a field setting in which 126 health care professionals (i.e., nurses, resident and attending physicians), organized in 26 teams, managed medical emergencies. Behavioral coding and leader language analyses supported our hypotheses: Leaders' WE-references were more strongly related to residents' (in-group) and explicit invitations related more strongly to nurses' (out-group) voice behavior. We discuss how inclusive leader language promotes employee voice and explain why group membership functions as an important moderator in professionally diverse teams.","[Weiss, Mona] NYU, Leonard N Stern Sch Business, Dept Management & Org, 44 West 4th St, New York, NY 10012 USA; [Weiss, Mona; Kolbe, Michaela; Grote, Gudela] ETH, Dept Management Technol & Econ, Zurich, Switzerland; [Kolbe, Michaela; Grande, Bastian] Univ Hosp Zurich, Simulat Ctr, Zurich, Switzerland; [Spahn, Donat R.; Grande, Bastian] Univ Hosp Zurich, Inst Anesthesiol, Zurich, Switzerland",,"Weiss, M (corresponding author), NYU, Leonard N Stern Sch Business, Dept Management & Org, 44 West 4th St, New York, NY 10012 USA.",mweiss@stern.nyu.edu,"Grote, Gudela/ABB-3515-2021; Grande, Bastian/AAH-4508-2021","Grande, Bastian/0000-0003-2935-1317; Grote, Gudela/0000-0002-5581-0452; Kolbe, Michaela/0000-0001-6654-6370; Weiss, Mona/0000-0003-2414-8336",Swiss National Science Foundation [100014_138545/1],Swiss National Science Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)European Commission),This research has been funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation (Grant No. 100014_138545/1).,,105,49,51,9,109,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1048-9843,1873-3409,,LEADERSHIP QUART,Leadersh.

Convergence discussions, because they are a costly signal, provide such assurance. Kogelmann and Stich fail to recognize that constituents influence representatives such that the costs of convergence discourse are unknown. It thus cannot assure. Constituents' influence also undermines convergence's ability to show how decision-making processes that follow its norms result in justified laws. Far from supporting convergence, then, the stability question demands revision of the view. This response develops these objections, extends them from Kogelmann and Stich's analysis to other convergence theorists and political liberals, and explores what political theorists can learn from convergence's difficulties.","[Hertzberg, Benjamin R.] Emory Univ, Polit Sci, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA",,"Hertzberg, BR (corresponding author), Emory Univ, Polit Sci, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA.",bhertzberg@emory.edu,,,,,,,29,1,1,0,5,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0003-0554,1537-5943,,AM POLIT SCI REV,Am.

Using data from an online experiment, this study shows that news coverage regarding behaviors and personal characteristics of a foreign leader influences (a) evaluations of personal characteristics typical of his or her nation's citizens and (b) emotional perceptions of that leader's country (sentiment and respect). This effect is shown to reflect a psychological phenomenon whereby people project their emotions and perceptions regarding a leader's personal characteristics onto his or her country and people.","[Balmas, Meital] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Commun, IL-91905 Jerusalem, Israel",,"Balmas, M (corresponding author), Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Commun, IL-91905 Jerusalem, Israel.",meitalbalmas@gmail.com,,,German-Israeli Foundation for Scientific Research and Development [2366],German-Israeli Foundation for Scientific Research and Development(German-Israeli Foundation for Scientific Research and Development),"The author is grateful to Tamir Sheafer, Ifat Maoz, Jon Krosnick, and Raanan Sulitzeanu-Kenan for help, comments, and advice on earlier versions of this article.

Structuralism encouraged scholars to consider language, like other social constructs, as organized as a self-defining and closed structure, set apart from spatiotemporal 'context' (which included diverse considerations such as history, geography, politics, and society). Translingualism calls for a shift from these structuralist assumptions to consider more mobile, expansive, situated, and holistic practices. In this article, I articulate how a poststructuralist paradigm might help us theorize and practice translingualism according to a spatial orientation that embeds communication in space and time, considering all resources as working together as an assemblage in shaping meaning. I illustrate from my ongoing research with international STEM scholars in a Midwestern American university to theorize how translingualism will redefine the role of constructs such as language, non-verbal artifacts, and context in communicative proficiency.","[Canagarajah, Suresh] Penn State Univ, Dept Appl Linguist, 303 Sparks Bldg, University Pk, PA 16803 USA",,"Canagarajah, S (corresponding author), Penn State Univ, Dept Appl Linguist, 303 Sparks Bldg, University Pk, PA 16803 USA.",asc16@psu.edu,,,,,,,47,142,144,6,61,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0142-6001,1477-450X,,APPL LINGUIST,Appl.

Our results demonstrate that citizens higher in relative deprivation are most likely to select populist messages. Irrespective of selective exposure, citizens' populist attitudes are only positively affected if the populist message is congruent with their prior feelings of relative deprivation.

While this scholarship has been developed primarily in the contexts of world Englishes, English as a lingua franca, and bilingual education in Anglophone nations, its implications to foreign language education in higher education have not been fully explored. The current article addresses this issue by shedding light on the conditions of teaching and learning of indigenous languages spoken in once-colonized regions of the world as an additional language for English speakers. More specifically, it examines how American students who participated in an eight-week YorA(1)ba study abroad program in Nigeria navigated a rather conspicuous gap between a monolingual utopia promoted by the program and the complex translingual realities of everyday language use outside of the classroom. Through the review of the perspectives of students with diverse backgrounds, the article discusses the significance of taking sociohistorical and geopolitical contexts surrounding the target language into account to cultivate informed learners.","[Mori, Junko; Sanuth, Kazeem Kehinde] Univ Wisconsin Madison, Madison, WI 53706 USA",,"Mori, J (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin Madison, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",jmori@wisc.edu,,,,,,,49,11,11,0,17,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0142-6001,1477-450X,,APPL LINGUIST,Appl.

While many people engage in public discourse through participatory media, knowledge gaps limit engagement in the networked public sphere. Participatory web platforms have unique potential to facilitate a more equitable production of knowledge. This paper conceptualizes a pipeline of online participation and models the awareness and behaviors necessary to become a contributor to the networked public sphere. We test the theory with the case of Wikipedia editing, relying on survey data from a diverse, national sample of U.S. adults. Our findings underscore the multidimensionality of digital inequalities and suggest new pathways toward closing knowledge gaps by highlighting the importance of education and Internet skills for online stratification processes.","[Shaw, Aaron] Northwestern Univ, Dept Commun Studies, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Hargittai, Eszter] Univ Zurich, Inst Commun & Media Res, CH-8050 Zurich, Switzerland",,"Shaw, A (corresponding author), Northwestern Univ, Dept Commun Studies, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",aaronshaw@northwestern.edu,,"Hargittai, Eszter/0000-0003-4199-4868",Merck; Robert and Kaye Hiatt Fund at Northwestern University,Merck(Merck & Company); Robert and Kaye Hiatt Fund at Northwestern University,The authors are grateful to Merck (Merck is known as MSD outside the United States and Canada) and the Robert and Kaye Hiatt Fund at Northwestern University for support.

The effects persisted for at least a month, and, as a byproduct, the intervention also reduced antipathy toward refugees, another stigmatized group in Hungary, and decreased vote intentions for Hungary's overtly racist, far-right party by 10%.

I contextualize Translanguaging in the linguistic realities of the 21st century, especially the fluid and dynamic practices that transcend the boundaries between named languages, language varieties, and language and other semiotic systems. I highlight the contributions Translanguaging as a theoretical concept can make to the debates over the Language and Thought and the Modularity of Mind hypotheses. One particular aspect of multilingual language users' social interaction that I want to emphasize is its multimodal and multisensory nature. I elaborate on two related concepts: Translanguaging Space and Translanguaging Instinct, to underscore the necessity to bridge the artificial and ideological divides between the so-called sociocultural and the cognitive approaches to Translanguaging practices. In doing so, I respond to some of the criticisms and confusions about the notion of Translanguaging.","[Wei, Li] UCL, UCL Inst Educ, UCL Ctr Appl Linguist, London, England",,"Wei, L (corresponding author), UCL, UCL Inst Educ, UCL Ctr Appl Linguist, London, England.",li.wei@ucl.ac.uk,"Li, Wei/Z-1091-2019","Li, Wei/0000-0002-2015-7262",Translation and Tranlanguaging project [RES-000-23-1180]; AHRC [AH/L007096/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Translation and Tranlanguaging project; AHRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Arts & Humanities Research Council (AHRC)),"The writing of this article benefited hugely from the numerous exchanges the author had with friends and colleagues, especially with members of the research team of the Translation and Tranlanguaging project (RES-000-23-1180: http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/generic/tlang/index.aspx) and the Cross-London Sociolinguistics Seminar Group (https://www.facebook.com/CLSociolinguisticsGroup/).

We further argue that what is most significant about the contemporary fake news furore is what it portends: the use of personally and emotionally targeted news produced by algo-journalism and what we term empathic media.

In particular, through the concept of prehension', we dissect the gameplay activity of Dota 2, identifying similarities with how the hand practices craft labour. We identify these practices as contact', apprehension', language acquisition' and reflection'. We argue that players develop these practices of the hand to make sense of the game's rules and controls. From this perspective, it is the hand that initiates experiences of craft within computer gameplay, and we offer examples of player creativity and experimentation to evidence its labour.

We focus on the uses and consequences of whining, in and for social interaction. Rather than identifying and attributing experiential causes or correlates of whining, we examine what children do with it, how it is occasioned, and how others, mostly parents, respond to it. Whining performs actions such as objecting to transgressions and thwarted goals and making complaints. Parental reactions include one or more of: stance inversion, which is the adoption of a contrasting tone in next turn; formulations of the offending circumstances; orientations to remedying the problem; and rejection of the whine's basis, including dispositional formulations of the child's whining (e.g., being grumpy) and accounts for not complying with a called-for remedy.

This article reviews expert opinions on the educational potential of The Hunger Games (THG) and the use of Twitter during the viewing of films by young audiences. The study has the twofold goal of analysing whether the tweets include the topics of ideology and values mentioned in the selected articles and whether the conversations help build knowledge of the subjects that, according to the experts, are discussed in the literary trilogy. The method, based on discourse analysis, is twofold as well, comprising, on one hand, the discussion of 61 selected academic papers on THG and, on the other, 6000 tweets posted by youngsters while watching the films in the trilogy shown on TV. The tweets were analysed using the coding and counting' technique in computer-mediated discourse analysis. The results show a great chasm between academic or educational perspectives and what youngsters see in the films. Twitter interactions show that the virtual environments where these interactions take place are mere virtual concourses rather than affinity or learning spaces. This draws attention to the need for a new type of media education which not only includes the popular culture in formal education environments, but also uses the virtual concourses where youngsters gather around media products to transform mere coexistence into convergence of interests based on the meaning of these products.","[Gutierrez-Martin, Alfonso; Torrego-Gonzalez, Alba] Univ Valladolid, Dept Pedag, Segovia, Spain",,"Gutierrez-Martin, A (corresponding author), Univ Valladolid, Dept Pedag, Segovia, Spain.",alfguti@pdg.uva.es; alba.torrego@uva.es,"Gutierrez-Martin, Alfonso/D-5528-2016","Gutierrez-Martin, Alfonso/0000-0002-2288-9459; Torrego, Alba/0000-0002-4083-8727",,,,,78,9,9,2,44,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

Interpersonal panopticism serves as a theoretical account of the fluid nature of watching and being watched in relationships, especially in consideration of how intimate relationships and sexualities are surveilled and controlled in a digital era. To articulate the utility and potentials of this theoretical approach, we offer five cultural propositions that serve as a basis for interpersonal panopticism.

This article contends that we are witnessing a third wave toward the rationalization of audience understanding and distinguishes between audience analytics (systems that capture information) and audience metrics (quantified measures output by those systems). The body of literature on analytics and metrics in the context of news production is then synthesized across the ABCDE of news production: attitudes, behaviors, content, discourse, and ethics. That synthesis leads to an overarching conclusion that while contemporary journalism is not being driven by quantified audiences, both audiences and quantification are playing far more prominent roles in news production than in the past. Scholars and practitioners have also become less pessimistic about analytics and metrics over time, recognizing more nuanced effects and prosocial possibilities. Finally, important gaps in the literature are identified and new research directions proposed to help address them.","[Zamith, Rodrigo] Univ Massachusetts Amherst, Journalism Dept, Amherst, MA 01003 USA",,"Zamith, R (corresponding author), Univ Massachusetts Amherst, Journalism Dept, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.",rzamith@umass.edu,,"Zamith, Rodrigo/0000-0001-8114-1734",,,,,53,67,68,3,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

It describes the teaching of Turkish to Greek-Cypriots, introduced in 2003 by the Republic of Cyprus as part of a de-securitization policy. Although these classes were optional, many students regarded Turks as enemies, and after documenting hostility itself as one motive for learning Turkish, we describe three teaching strategies used to deal with the powerful emotions that Turkish evoked: (i) focusing on the language as a code, shorn of any cultural association; (ii) treating it as a local language; and (iii) presenting it as a contemporary international language in a cosmopolitan ambience that potentially transcended the island-specific conflict. In this way, the Cypriot case calls mainstream language teaching assumptions into question: exclusively grammar-focused pedagogies display acute cultural sensitivity, and images of language in a globalized world look radical and innovative. For intercultural language education more generally, it is the combination of institutionalised language learning as a distinct cultural activity with the ideological plasticity of language itself that seems especially valuable.","[Charalambous, Panayiota; Charalambous, Constadina] European Univ Cyprus, Engomi, Cyprus; [Rampton, Ben] Kings Coll London, London, England",,"Rampton, B (corresponding author), Kings Coll London, London, England.",ben.rampton@kcl.ac.uk,"Charalambous, Constadina/AAC-6647-2019","Charalambous, Constadina/0000-0003-3326-0055; Rampton, Ben/0000-0002-2437-1944",,,,,58,12,12,1,16,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0142-6001,1477-450X,,APPL LINGUIST,Appl.

Habermas on Religious Translation and Cooperative Learning in Post-secular Society,AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,,PUBLIC SPHERE,"This article evaluates Jurgen Habermas's attempt to reopen political liberalism to religion. In trying to take religion seriously, Habermas goes further than John Rawls and other liberal theorists by affirming that religious traditions articulate truths on which democratic societies continue to depend for their civic and moral health. Post-secular societies, in his view, should learn from religion by translating its moral intuitions into universal secular language. Although Habermas in this way appears friendlier to religion than Rawls, unlike Rawls he also calls for the modernization of religious consciousness. This theological transformation not only reveals the foundationalist presuppositions of liberalism, but also points to a highly attenuated conception of learning from religion. Taking religion seriously will require us to be open to its insights not only when they agree with, but especially when they challenge, our secular presuppositions. This dimension of religion is at risk of getting lost in translation in the Habermasian paradigm.","[Areshidze, Giorgi] Claremont Mckenna Coll, Govt, Claremont, CA 91711 USA",,"Areshidze, G (corresponding author), Claremont Mckenna Coll, Govt, Claremont, CA 91711 USA.",giorgi.areshidze@gmail.com,,,,,,,86,7,7,0,8,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0003-0554,1537-5943,,AM POLIT SCI REV,Am.

Although redemptive violence had roots in prerevolutionary notions of penal justice and social cohesion, its philosophical ambitions were revolutionary and modern.

In an attempt to fill this gap, the present longitudinal study aims to analyse the impact of CLIL on different affective components. The participants are 304 secondary education students who were enrolled in CLIL and non-CLIL programmes. Contrary to expectations and the reviewed literature, the downward motivational trend observed in non-CLIL students in previous studies was not found.

I argue that by privileging the variety of the host institution as a means to monitor all incoming Englishes, the institution perpetuates traditional-though academically contested-centre-periphery categorizations of global Englishes.

Regression analyses indicated that cultural identification was predicted by age of language acquisition, language proficiency, foreign accentedness, and contexts of long-term language immersion and current language exposure. Follow-up analyses revealed that the language-culture relations were mediated by the age and manner in which the second language was acquired. These findings are situated within a proposed framework of bilingual cultural identity. By identifying features of bilingualism that are relevant for cultural identity, the current research increases our understanding of the relationship between language and culture.","[Schroeder, Scott R.; Lam, Tuan Q.; Marian, Viorica] Northwestern Univ, Dept Commun Sci & Disorders, Evanston, IL 60208 USA",,"Schroeder, SR (corresponding author), Northwestern Univ, Dept Commun Sci & Disorders, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",schroeder@u.northwestern.edu,,"Marian, Viorica/0000-0002-8335-1433",NICHD [1R01HD059858]; EUNICE KENNEDY SHRIVER NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF CHILD HEALTH & HUMAN DEVELOPMENT [R01HD059858] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER,NICHD(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD)); EUNICE KENNEDY SHRIVER NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF CHILD HEALTH & HUMAN DEVELOPMENT(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD)),"The authors thank Anthony Shook, James Bartolotti, Sarah Chabal, Jennifer Krizman, Max Freeman, and Marcella Lowell for their contributions to the current study.

Source attributions and verbal reports provided information on type of learning (implicit and/or explicit), which were analysed in an exploratory fashion to classify within-participant implicit and explicit learning. Sixty-three participants demonstrated both types of learning, which suggests that extant binary classifications of type of learning may be inadequate. Furthermore, there were no significant performance differences on the GJT based on type of learning despite poor performance overall.

In foregrounding the concept of Spracherleben, the lived experience of language, this article contributes to the ongoing debate on how to rethink the notion of the linguistic repertoire considering that current phenomena such as increased mobility, migration, or participation in transnational networks of communication make it difficult to take, as Gumperz (1964) did in his original concept, relatively stable speech communities as point of departure. The notion of the lived experience of language which I am elaborating here emphasizes the intersubjective dimension of language as a gesture toward the other and casts light on the often-neglected bodily and emotional dimensions of perception and speech. Attaching particular importance to the perspective of the experiencing subject, the concept is based on phenomenological approaches, as developed in the 1940s by the French philosopher Merleau-Ponty.","[Busch, Brigitta] Univ Vienna, Dept Linguist, Vienna, Austria",,"Busch, B (corresponding author), Univ Vienna, Dept Linguist, Vienna, Austria.",brigitta.busch@univie.ac.at,,,,,,,48,89,91,2,21,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0142-6001,1477-450X,,APPL LINGUIST,Appl.

Many theories posit that information flows more easily in ethnically homogeneous areas, facilitating collective action, because social networks among coethnics are denser. Although this characterization is ubiquitous, little empirical work assesses it. Through a novel field experiment in a matched pair of villages in rural Uganda, this article directly examines word-of-mouth information spread and its relationship to ethnic diversity and networks. As expected, information spread more widely in the homogeneous village. However, unexpectedly, the more diverse village's network is significantly denser. Using unusually detailed network data, we offer an explanation for why network density may hamper information dissemination in heterogeneous areas, showing why even slight hesitation to share information with people from other groups can have large aggregate effects.","[Larson, Jennifer M.] NYU, Dept Polit, Polit, 19 W 4th St, New York, NY 10012 USA; [Lewis, Janet I.] US Naval Acad, Dept Polit Sci, Polit Sci, 589 McNair Rd, Annapolis, MD 21402 USA",,"Larson, JM (corresponding author), NYU, Dept Polit, Polit, 19 W 4th St, New York, NY 10012 USA.",jenn.larson@nyu.edu; janetilewis@gmail.com,,"Lewis, Janet/0000-0001-7275-8791; Larson, Jennifer/0000-0001-7681-2935",Harvard's Institute for Quantitative Social Science,Harvard's Institute for Quantitative Social Science,"We thank Robert Bates, Andrew Coe, Nick Eubank, Guy Grossman, Lorien Jasny, Michael Joseph, Zane Kelly, Armando Razo, Pedro Rodriguez, Dustin Tingley, Stefan Wojcik, Josef Woldense, and especially Pia Raffler for helpful comments on pieces of this project.

The focus is on the resolution of intra-sentential anaphora and cataphora in Italian by two groups of native speakers, English-Italian trainee translators and a control group of non-translators. The participants did a picture selection task in which they had to identify the antecedents of third person null and overt subject pronouns in ambiguous anaphoric and cataphoric conditions. Contrary to what was expected based on previous work, proposing that translators undergo a form of first language attrition due to extended exposure to a second language, trainee translators did not exhibit evidence of overt pronoun overgeneralization (i. e. second language influence). In fact, they selected pragmatically inappropriate antecedents to a lesser extent than the control group, leading to the conclusion that in language comprehension, metalinguistic awareness can override other influences affecting translators.","[Milicevic, Maja] Univ Belgrade, Fac Philol, Appl Linguist, Dept Gen Linguist, Belgrade, Serbia; [Kras, Tihana] Univ Rijeka, Fac Humanities & Social Sci, Dept English Language & Literature, Sveucilisna Ave 4, Rijeka 51000, Croatia",,"Milicevic, M (corresponding author), Univ Belgrade, Fac Philol, Appl Linguist, Dept Gen Linguist, Belgrade, Serbia.",m.milicevic@fil.bg.ac.rs,"Kras, Tihana/S-5581-2018; Petrović, Maja Miličević/ABH-7567-2020","Kras, Tihana/0000-0001-5359-9641; Petrović, Maja Miličević/0000-0003-4137-1898",Italian Government Bursary for Foreign and I.

This study proposes an empirical definition of political communication style with the aim of identifying characteristics of the populist political communication style. Between 2015 and 2016, the Twitter timelines of the main political leaders in Italy were analysed for 16 months. Applying an MCA allowed us to identify two key factors that characterise the communication styles of leaders: (1) communication mode, comparing negative and positive; and (2) communicative focus, comparing personalisation and political/campaign. The intersection of these two factors resulted in four different political communication styles: Engaging', Intimate', Champion of the people' and Man of the street'. The latter two were clearly characterised by the presence of populist ideology fragments and traits, but were not strictly related to the leaders' ideological positions. This result supports the hypothesis that populist style is less and less connected to the right/left political cleavage, but rather the result of a varied combination of gradations that mix different individual aspects of the leader's political communication style.","[Bracciale, Roberta] Univ Pisa, Dept Polit Sci, Sociol New Media, Pisa, Italy; [Martella, Antonio] Univ Pisa, Dept Polit Sci, Polit Commun, Pisa, Italy",,"Bracciale, R (corresponding author), Univ Pisa, Dept Polit Sci, Via Serafini 3, I-56126 Pisa, Italy.",roberta.bracciale@unipi.it; antonio.martella@sp.unipi.it,"BRACCIALE, ROBERTA/AAQ-7921-2020","BRACCIALE, ROBERTA/0000-0002-7567-4785; Martella, Antonio/0000-0003-3378-1782",,,,,67,73,74,2,35,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

Internationally, courts, legislators and policy makers are developing new definitions that incorporate a broader understanding of journalism practice, as territories blur and shift across digital spaces. However, a lack of consensus has resulted in jurisdictional clashes, challenges to legislative amendments, appeals to higher courts, and confusion for regulators and practitioners alike. In Australia, recently legislated shield laws have resulted in different definitions across the country's various jurisdictions. In the United States, court cases relating to defamation and shield laws have been successfully appealed based on differing definitions of the role of a journalist. In New Zealand, a High Court judgement overturned a lower court decision, to find that a blogger could be viewed as a journalist. At the same time, courts internationally are developing policies and guidelines relating to live text-based communication from courts, which also requires them to determine who is permitted to text, tweet or blog from within courtroom. This paper examines how these courts, legislators and policy makers are grappling with the challenges of redefining journalist and news media while ultimately focusing on the objective of ensuring a free and democratic flow of information.","[Johnston, Jane] Univ Queensland, Sch Commun & Arts, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Wallace, Anne] Edith Cowan Univ, Sch Business & Law, Churchlands, WA, Australia",,"Johnston, J (corresponding author), Univ Queensland, Sch Commun & Arts, Brisbane, Qld, Australia.",jane.johnston@uq.edu.au; a.wallace@ecu.edu.au,"Johnston, Jane L/H-8090-2016","Johnston, Jane L/0000-0003-1750-3977; Wallace, Anne/0000-0002-3825-9558",,,,,47,16,16,0,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

We evaluated this phenomenon through two conceptual lenses: theories on nonsense in the pre-digital age and the techno-cultural conditions that facilitate its contemporary formations. A grounded analysis of 139 nonsensical memes led to their typology into 5 genres: linguistic silliness, embodied silliness, pastiche, dislocations, and interruptions. In each of these genres, we show how digital nonsense may potentially serve as a social glue that bonds members of phatic, image-oriented, communities. If, in the past, nonsense was depicted in both intellectual terms, as defiant deconstruction of meaning, and in playful/ social terms, its current memetic manifestations lean heavily toward the latter. Rather than being a reflection on ` referential meaning', digital nonsense is analyzed as a generative source of ` affective meaning' that marks the formation of social connections preceding cognitive understanding. We conclude by highlighting the potentially subversive implications of this shift for participatory barriers and community membership.","[Katz, Yuval] Univ Michigan, Dept Commun Studies, 105 S State St, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Shifman, Limor] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Commun & Journalism, Jerusalem, Israel",,"Katz, Y (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Dept Commun Studies, 105 S State St, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",yuvalkz@umich.edu; limor.shifman@mail.huji.ac.il,,"Katz, Yuval/0000-0002-7332-5389",,,,,55,30,30,1,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

The results show that while most preferred responses are produced with gaze toward the questioner, most dispreferred responses are produced with gaze aversion. We further demonstrate that gaze aversion by respondents can occasion self-repair by questioners in the transition space between turns, indicating that the relationship between gaze direction and preference is more than a mere statistical association.

It analyses 1249 news reports mentioning encryption in The Guardian and The New York Times, covering a three-year period from June 2012 to June 2015 (one year before and two years after the Snowden revelations). Whilst there was a marked increase in the volume of news articles mentioning encryption post-Snowden, the context in which encryption is discussed has since shifted from an initial emphasis on surveillance towards security issues. However, the research found that greater news coverage of encryption did not necessarily mean an increase in depth of coverage, with most mentions of encryption vague and non-descript. In terms of source usage, the research finds an emphasis on private corporations in both publications analysed. This is problematic when many of the organisations allowed to speak on encryption were those accused of colluding with the US and UK Governments to aid covert mass surveillance-the likes of Google, Facebook, Apple, Microsoft and so forth-thus providing them with a platform to exonerate themselves from the accusations. This contradictory depiction of communication security serves the status quo and prevents advancement of the  encrypted by default communication practice called for by Snowden. This, by extension, has serious implications for both journalistic freedom and civil liberties since it helps to perpetuate the ability of nation states and corporations to conduct indiscriminate mass surveillance.","[Thorsen, Einar] Bournemouth Univ, Sch Journalism English & Commun, Poole BH12 5BB, Dorset, England",,"Thorsen, E (corresponding author), Bournemouth Univ, Sch Journalism English & Commun, Poole BH12 5BB, Dorset, England.",ethorsen@bournemouth.ac.uk,,,,,,,27,7,7,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

During 6-weeks in Seoul, Julie struggled to gain participation and to define her identity in a setting that was hostile towards homosexuality. These struggles were exacerbated by her Korean class, where she was positioned as an 'older' student and, therefore, consigned to working with a 'sexist' and 'narcissistic' 65-year-old European male ('Peter'). Within this unfavourable socio-historical context, this study focuses on how Julie exerted her agency to modulate her identity and redefine the socialmaterial conditions of her language learning. I argue that through exerting her agency Julie was able to alter the 'rules of interaction' in the 'activity system' that she was part of. As such, Julie's story highlights the significance of acts of 'changing' in defining language learning experiences and emphasizes the role of agency in activity-theoretic approaches to language learning.","[Brown, Lucien] Univ Oregon, East Asian Languages & Literatures, 425 Friendly Hall, Eugene, OR 97403 USA",,"Brown, L (corresponding author), Univ Oregon, East Asian Languages & Literatures, 425 Friendly Hall, Eugene, OR 97403 USA.",lucien@uoregon.edu,,,,,,,31,11,11,1,19,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0142-6001,1477-450X,,APPL LINGUIST,Appl.

In this study, I combine insights from the cultural cognition, affect control theory, and cultural transmission frameworks to examine how one form of internalized culturefundamental cultural sentimentsaffects the content of information shared in communication. I argue that individuals communicate narratives in ways that minimize deflection of internalized cultural sentiments, resulting in cultural-consistency bias. I test this proposition using a serial transmission study in which participants read and retell short stories. Results show that culturally inconsistent, high-deflection information experiences an initial boost in memorability, but consistency biases ultimately win out as information is altered to increase cultural consistency, demonstrating that deflection provides a promising measure of cultural schema-consistency. This measure is predictive of the information that individuals share in communication and changes to this information in the transmission process.","[Hunzaker, M. B.

We develop a theoretical framework that encompasses the major extant models, formalizing the tradeoff between concerns about the location of the new median justice versus concerns about the ideology of the nominee herself We then use advances in measurement and scaling to place presidents, senators, justices, and nominees on the same scale, allowing us to test predictions that hold across all model variants. We find very little support for MTM theory. Senators have been much more accommodating of the president's nominees than MTM theory would suggest-many have been confirmed when the theory predicted they should have been rejected. These errors have been consequential. presidents have selected many nominees who are much more extreme than MTM theory would predict.

The blogosphere is often perceived as a racially neutral space where shared interests across geographical and temporal boundaries limit the significance of racial and ethnic identity. However, the constructed narratives of Black British women in this study highlight their experiences of subtle forms of prejudice and discrimination perpetuated through dominant discourses in the mainstream media. The findings demonstrate how they use blogs as a medium for discursive activism to challenge stereotypical raced and gendered representation in the mainstream media.

Drawing on data from democratic national and state constitutions, we challenge the consensus among constitutional theorists that a central purpose of constitutionalism is the entrenchment (the fortification against future change) of broad principles. The empirical reality is that the majority of democratic constitutions today are subject to frequent revision, and are therefore ill-equipped to facilitate the entrenchment of their contents. To explore the logic of these unentrenched documents, we identify the historical periods in which different geographic regions moved away from highly entrenched constitutions, and we examine the political contexts of these transformations.

By focusing on a sample of rare disease patient organisations as representative of contemporary health activism, this study investigates the role of digital communication in the development of (1) bottom-up sharing and co-production of health knowledge, (2) health public engagement dynamics and (3) health information pathways. Findings show that digital media affordances for patient organisations go beyond the provision of social support for patient communities; they ease one-way, two-way and crowdsourced processes of health knowledge sharing, exchange and co-production, provide personalised routes to health public engagement and bolster the emergence of varied pathways to health information where experiential knowledge and medical authority are equally valued. These forms of organisationally enabled connective action can help the surfacing of personal narratives that strengthen patient communities, the bottom-up production of health knowledge relevant to a wider public and the development of an informational and eventually cultural context that eases patients' political action.","[Vicari, Stefania] Univ Leicester, Dept Media & Commun, Leicester, Leics, England; [Cappai, Franco] Fase 1 Srl, Cagliari, Italy",,"Vicari, S (corresponding author), Univ Leicester, Dept Media & Commun, Leicester, Leics, England.",sv32@le.ac.uk,"Vicari, Stefania/AAG-7400-2022","Vicari, Stefania/0000-0002-4506-2358",Wellcome Trust [101785/Z/13/Z],Wellcome Trust(Wellcome TrustEuropean Commission),This work was supported by the Wellcome Trust under Grant [101785/Z/13/Z].,,52,28,29,3,63,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

The current study seeks to address this gap by investigating the effects of language aptitude on L1 retention in late attriters. Forty L1 Spanish - L2 Swedish bilinguals living in Sweden participated in the study, along with 20 functionally monolingual L1 speakers of Spanish. L1 proficiency was measured by means of a grammaticality judgement test (GJT) and language aptitude data were obtained through the LLAMA Language Aptitude Test (Meara 2005). Additional data on the participants' linguistic background were also collected. Results revealed a robust difference in GJT scores between the bilinguals and the control group. However, degree of language aptitude was not found to exert a significant influence on the bilinguals' GJT performance. Instead, the only significant predictor for GJT performance was linguistic identification, showing that those participants with strong L1 identification were more accurate in judging L1 grammaticality. The lack of aptitude effects on L1 attrition is discussed against the background of age-related attrition susceptibility.","[Bylund, Emanuel] Linnaeus Univ, Dept Swedish, SE-35195 Vaxjo, Sweden; [Bylund, Emanuel; Ramirez-Galan, Pedro] Stockholm Univ, Ctr Res Bilingualism, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden",,"Bylund, E (corresponding author), Linnaeus Univ, Dept Swedish, SE-35195 Vaxjo, Sweden.;Bylund, E (corresponding author), Stockholm Univ, Ctr Res Bilingualism, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden.",manne.bylund@biling.su.se,,,,,,,66,7,7,1,39,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0142-6001,1477-450X,,APPL LINGUIST,Appl.

Gender is often perceived to be a salient identity category among adult L2 learners overseas. Drawing on the language socialization framework (Ochs and Schieffelin 1984), this study focuses on how gender is constructed and indexed through language as the American students learn to use Mandarin sentence-final particles. Sentence-final particles constitute a unique repertoire to achieve affective work in Mandarin. They have further become a resource among China's urban youth to enact a cute female speech style. In this case study, I employ a qualitative approach with an embedded quantitative component to examine the participants' use of the particles over the course of one semester. The findings show how the American students become socialized into using these particles as gendered linguistic practices in the dorm conversations.","[Diao, Wenhao] Univ Arizona, Dept Asian Studies, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA",,"Diao, WH (corresponding author), Univ Arizona, Dept Asian Studies, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA.",wdiao@email.arizona.edu,,,,,,,66,27,27,0,51,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0142-6001,1477-450X,,APPL LINGUIST,Appl.

There has been limited attention, however, to the fundamental issues, both practical and conceptual, involved in conducting these joint scalings, or to the sensitivity of these estimates to modeling assumptions and data choices. I show that the standard strategy of estimating ideal point models using preference data on citizens and elites can suffer from potentially problematic pathologies.

We focus on what we call mobile-supported sharing activities, in which participants use a mobile phone to share text or images with others by voicing text aloud from their mobile or providing others with visual access to the device's display screen. Drawing from naturalistic video recordings, we focus on how mobile-supported sharing activities invite assessments by providing access to an object that is not locally accessible to the participants. Such practices make relevant coparticipants' assessment of these objects and allow for different forms of coparticipation across sequence types. We additionally examine how the organization of assessments during these sharing activities displays sensitivity to preference structure. The analysis illustrates the relevance of embodiment, local objects, and new communicative technologies to the production of action in copresent interaction.

Originally introduced by Jernudd and NeustupnA1/2 in 1987, as a novel continuation of the language planning tradition stemming from the 1960/70s, language management along these lines has developed into the Language Management Theory (LMT). A second definition of language management, diverting from LMT, can be found in the work of Spolsky, who treats language management as a theoretical component of the wider concept of language policy. Furthermore, over the past 15 years a number of scholars, particularly from the international management discipline, appear to have taken an interest in language as a variable in business and corporate management. It is also common to refer to this research field as language management. This conceptual article offers a theoretically based comparison of the three definitions of language management, before discussing five main focus points, which may be used to highlight their analytical differences.","[Sanden, Guro Refsum] Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Int Business Commun, Dalgas Have 15, DK-2000 Frederiksberg, Denmark",,"Sanden, GR (corresponding author), Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Int Business Commun, Dalgas Have 15, DK-2000 Frederiksberg, Denmark.",grs.ibc@cbs.dk,,"Sanden, Guro/0000-0001-5450-6320",,,,,39,13,13,4,8,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0142-6001,1477-450X,,APPL LINGUIST,Appl.

On the one hand, as has often been recognized, Smith saw a high degree of economic inequality as an inevitable result of a flourishing commercial society, and he considered a certain amount of such inequality to be positively useful as a means of encouraging productivity and bolstering political stability. On the other hand, it has seldom been noticed that Smith also expressed deep worries about some of the other effects of extreme economic inequalityworries that are, moreover, interestingly different from those that dominate contemporary discourse. In Smith's view, extreme economic inequality leads people to sympathize more fully and readily with the rich than the poor, and this distortion in our sympathies in turn undermines both morality and happiness.","[Rasmussen, Dennis C.] Tufts Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Medford, MA 02155 USA",,"Rasmussen, DC (corresponding author), Tufts Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Medford, MA 02155 USA.",dennis.rasmussen@tufts.edu,,,,,,,34,24,24,1,19,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0003-0554,1537-5943,,AM POLIT SCI REV,Am.

The current analysis finds that the learning outcomes depend considerably on the extent of assessment of awareness or knowledge acquired.","[Fukuta, Junya] Nagoya Univ, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan",,"Fukuta, J (corresponding author), Nagoya Univ, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan.",fukuta@nagoya-u.jp,"Fukuta, Junya/AAQ-9050-2021","Fukuta, Junya/0000-0001-9291-048X",Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [13J00724],"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science)","This research was supported in part by a Grant-in-Aid for Fellows of the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (13J00724).

As a first-time test of this on mobile devices, a neighborhood texting intervention was employed in New York City public housing. Results of this 3-month field experiment revealed that intervention participants reported better health but worse neighborhood cohesion compared to those in the control condition. Qualitative analysis of texts and interviews suggests that participation improved interpersonal ties but did not improve neighborhood ties. Findings expand glocalization research to encompass mobile contexts and health outcomes, and support a theory of networked individualism, which argues that digital groups should be conceptualized as a compilation of overlapping interpersonal ties.","[Gonzales, Amy L.] Indiana Univ, Media Sch, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA",,"Gonzales, AL (corresponding author), Indiana Univ, Media Sch, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",gonzaamy@indiana.edu,,,Robert Wood Johnson Foundation,Robert Wood Johnson Foundation(Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF)),"This project was funded through a grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

It offers an analysis of the way the platform redefines journalism's quality standards against the background of the tension between traditional modernistic claims to truth and competing postmodern ideas on the social construction of knowledge. Moreover, the article examines how these ideals are translated into journalistic texts. The article argues that both in its rhetoric and in its actual practice, the articles in De Correspondent deviate from the principles of quality journalism under the objectivity regime. They are structured around the mediating subjectivity of the journalists and are thus openly subjective. Yet, they also draw on empirical research and scientific knowledge. Moreover, they are transparent about the reporting process, which through their reflection becomes an integral part of the story itself. Thus, being transparent about their combination of different forms of knowledge, rooted in more traditional rational-positivistic inquiry as well as in personal experience and emotion, they try to reconcile the tension between the modernist and postmodernist claims to truth.","[Harbers, Frank] Univ Groningen, Ctr Media & Journalism Studies, NL-9700 AB Groningen, Netherlands",,"Harbers, F (corresponding author), Univ Groningen, Ctr Media & Journalism Studies, NL-9700 AB Groningen, Netherlands.",F.Harbers@rug.nl,,"Harbers, Frank/0000-0003-1578-7582",,,,,63,26,26,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

Some researchers have focused on the effects of variously worded self-report measures. Others advocate the use of aggregate and/or behavioral data that does not rely on a person's ability to accurately recall exposure. Our study illustrates how an experimental design can be used to improve measures of exposure. In particular, we show how an experimental benchmark can be employed to (1) compare actual (i.e., manipulated) and self-reported values of news exposure; (2) assess how closely the self-reported items approximate the performance of true exposure in an empirical application; and (3) investigate whether a variation in question wording improves the accuracy of self-reported exposure measures.","[Jerit, Jennifer; Barabas, Jason; Pollock, William] SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Polit Sci, Social & Behav Sci Bldg, Stony Brook, NY 11744 USA; [Banducci, Susan; Stevens, Daniel] Univ Exeter, Dept Polit, Exeter, Devon, England; [Schoonvelde, Martijn] Vrije Univ, Amsterdam, Netherlands",,"Jerit, J (corresponding author), SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Polit Sci, Social & Behav Sci Bldg, Stony Brook, NY 11744 USA.",jennifer.jerit@stonybrook.edu,,"Schoonvelde, Martijn/0000-0003-4370-2654",Economic and Social Research Council [ES/K004395/1] Funding Source: researchfish,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,41,13,13,1,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1931-2458,1931-2466,,COMMUN METHODS MEAS,Commun.

Over the past decade, award-winning photojournalist David Burnett has used a 60-year-old Speed Graphic film camera to document US political events, several Olympic Games, and the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, among other projects. His photographs reveal a significantly different aesthetic from contemporary photojournalism and he is celebrated for the perspective his analog photographs offer. This analysis is based on two points of examination: first, a textual analysis of articles and videos discussing the work; and second, a semiotic analysis of the imagery. The examination suggests Burnett's photo aesthetic signifies a longing for an imagined analog, journalistic utopia of yore, where individual journalists had the time and freedom to put care and attention into their work.","[Mendelson, Andrew L.] CUNY, Grad Sch Journalism, New York, NY 10021 USA; [Creech, Brian] Temple Univ, Dept Journalism, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA",,"Mendelson, AL (corresponding author), CUNY, Grad Sch Journalism, New York, NY 10021 USA.",andrew.mendel-son@journalism.cuny.edu; brian.creech@temple.edu,"Creech, Brian/AAR-8116-2021","Creech, Brian/0000-0002-0986-6842",,,,,79,5,6,0,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

As such, they offer journalism and news researchers an opportunity to study how search engines, in this case Google, mediate news events and stories online. However, search results are not straightforward to study. Since search results are made in the act of searching and will have to be retrieved from Google Search in real-time, there is a range of different ontological and methodological issues related to this data source. This paper addresses these issues by discussing how factors in the search algorithm can be used proactively to study variations across searchers and in time. The paper identifies various endogenous and exogenous factors in the search algorithm one has to pay attention to and discusses ways to archive search results accordingly. Through a small case study, ways to work with the influence of endogenous factors (keywords, language settings, geo-location, Web history and clicking behaviour) and mitigate the effects of the exogenous factors (experimentation and randomisation) are suggested. Then, a new approach to studying search results is put forward, which builds on purposeful sampling of real-world participants or constructed research profiles. Finally, perspectives for news and journalism scholars in studying algorithmically generated content in a broader context are offered.","[Ormen, Jacob] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Media Cognit & Commun, DK-1168 Copenhagen, Denmark",,"Ormen, J (corresponding author), Univ Copenhagen, Dept Media Cognit & Commun, DK-1168 Copenhagen, Denmark.",dcs499@hum.ku.dk,,"Ormen, Jacob/0000-0003-4807-8395",,,,,44,16,16,1,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

When images and text are presented together, as in a typical news report, the frame carried by the text influences opinions regardless of the accompanying image, whereas the frame carried by the image drives behavioral intentions irrespective of the linked text.

Between 1974 and 2011, the level of democracy increased in 62 countries following the adoption of a new constitution, but decreased or stayed the same in 70 others. Using data covering all 138 new constitutions in 118 countries during that period, we explain this divergence through empirical tests showing that overall increased participation during the process of making the constitution positively impacts postpromulgation levels of democracy. Then, after disaggregating constitution-making into three stages (drafting, debating, and ratification) we find compelling evidence through robust statistical tests that the degree of citizen participation in the drafting stage has amuch greater impact on the resulting regime. This lends support to some core principles of deliberative theories of democracy. We conclude that constitutional reformers should focus more on generating public buy in at the front end of the constitution-making process, rather than concentrating on ratification and referendums at the back end that are unlikely to correct for an original sin of limited citizen deliberation during drafting.","[Eisenstadt, Todd A.] Amer Univ, Dept Govt, Sch Publ Affairs, Washington, DC 20016 USA; [Levan, A.

Previous research has found that the participant who initiated a conversation preferably also initiates its termination with a possible preclosing. Advice acknowledgments, lying in the epistemic domain of the client, are devices that may work as preclosings. However, in text-based chat clients regularly refrain from advice acknowledgment. While counselors use various practices to elicit advice acknowledgment in the context of potential advice resistance, hoaxing, and/or seemingly long pauses, these questions do not always succeed as closing devices.

Possible explanations for divergent outcomes include learner individual differences, goals and foci of instruction, type and duration of instructional input, and assessment procedures. After identifying key concepts, we survey 75 L2 pronunciation studies, particularly their methods and results. Despite a move towards emphasizing speech intelligibility and comprehensibility, most research surveyed promoted native-like pronunciation as the target. Although most studies entailed classroom instruction, many featured Computer Assisted Pronunciation Teaching (CAPT). Segmentals were studied more often than suprasegmentals. The amount of instruction required to effect change was related to researchers' goals; interventions focusing on a single feature were generally shorter than those addressing more issues. Reading-aloud tasks were the most common form of assessment; very few studies measured spontaneous speech. The attribution of improvement as a result of instruction was compromised in some instances by lack of a control group. We summarize our findings, highlight limitations of current research, and offer suggestions for future directions.","[Thomson, Ron I.] Brock Univ, Dept Appl Linguist, St Catharines, ON L2S 3A1, Canada; [Derwing, Tracey M.] Univ Alberta, Dept Educ Psychol, Edmonton, AB T6G 2E1, Canada; [Derwing, Tracey M.] Simon Fraser Univ, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada",,"Thomson, RI (corresponding author), Brock Univ, Dept Appl Linguist, St Catharines, ON L2S 3A1, Canada.",Ron.thomson@brocku.ca; tderwing@ualberta.ca,,,SSHRCC,SSHRCC,"The authors wish to thank Jenna Cheeseman for assistance with gathering literature for this review.

Yet in the face of this barrage of media, citizens have developed few formative experiences for acquiring these audiovisual and media languages or for increasing their audiovisual and media skills. The main aim of this study is to assess media competence in the Spanish region of Andalusia with the use of an instrument specially designed for the purpose. The measurement criteria and indicators of this tool are shaped by media literacy paradigms and leading international reference models, in particular the model proposed by Hobbs. The instrument consists of indicators which, according to their features, are measured via subjective or objective questions and multiple choice (ordinal or nominal) options. Measurement is standardized by the interpretation of the responses to the items on a scale of 1- 4. The construct is validated by means of factorial analysis to confirm the presence of the five factors (criteria) that form the instrument. The sample consists of 667 adult citizens aged 18-55, resident in Andalusia. The results corroborate the influence of demographic factors on media literacy levels and help identify clusters of citizens that can facilitate the design of targeted literacy projects. The results show that media competence is a construct articulated by dimensions of a varied nature that correlate in many different ways to distinctive social groups within this study.","[Aguaded-Gomez, Ignacio; Tirado-Morueta, Ramon] Univ Huelva, Dept Educ, Fac Educ, Huelva 21071, Spain; [Hernando-Gomez, Angel] Univ Huelva, Dept Psychol & Educ, Huelva 21071, Spain",,"Aguaded-Gomez, I (corresponding author), Univ Huelva, Dept Educ, Fac Educ, Campus El Carmen, Huelva 21071, Spain.",ignacio@aguaded.es,"TIRADO MORUETA, RAMÓN/ABE-3766-2021; Tirado-Morueta, Ramón/C-6778-2013; Longoria, Inés Alvarez Icaza/AAW-3137-2021; AGUADED, Ignacio/R-4281-2016; Hernando, Ángel/F-1180-2014","TIRADO MORUETA, RAMÓN/0000-0002-3965-3063; Tirado-Morueta, Ramón/0000-0002-3965-3063; AGUADED, Ignacio/0000-0002-0229-1118; Hernando, Ángel/0000-0002-6414-5415",Regional Autonomous Government of Andalusia's Excellence in Research Project [SEJ-5823-2010]; Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (Spain) [EDU2010-21395-C03-03],Regional Autonomous Government of Andalusia's Excellence in Research Project; Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (Spain),"The authors wish to thank the Regional Autonomous Government of Andalusia's Excellence in Research Project SEJ-5823-2010, entitled 'The audiovisual competence of Andalusian citizenship'.

To address this gap, a laboratory experiment was conducted in which we tested the relationship between task complexity and the emergence of transformational leadership behavior. In this experiment, 111 participants were divided in groups of three (comprising one leader and two subordinates), and were instructed to solve three decision-making tasks with varying levels of task complexity. Results indicated that task complexity was negatively related to transformational leadership behavior, and that this relationship was partially mediated by the leader's state core self-evaluations. In other words, when leaders encounter tasks that are overwhelmingly complex, they act in less transformational ways because they momentarily lack the psychological resources to do so.

We examine the effects of framing on evaluations when audiences are exposed to a multiplicity of frames, both by the same actor as the result of recurrent communications over time and by multiple actors who vie for attention. Using 36,012 research reports by securities analysts, covering the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industry between 1989 and 2012, we tested the relationships between analysts' framing repertoires and professional investors' evaluations of analysts as measured in the publication of Institutional Investor's short list of the best analysts of the year. We found that investors appreciate analysts with framing repertoires that resonate with their needs, that are internally coherent over time, and that offer a moderate amount of novelty in comparison to others' framings. We also found that framing is particularly important for analysts without existing high status, that is, who have never before been recognized as stars or who cannot benefit from association with a prestigious employer.","[Giorgi, Simona] Boston Coll, Carroll Sch Management, Management & Org, Chestnut Hill, MA 02467 USA; [Weber, Klaus] Northwestern Univ, Kellogg Sch Management, Management & Org, Evanston, IL 60208 USA",,"Giorgi, S (corresponding author), Boston Coll, Carroll Sch Management, Management & Org, 140 Commonwealth Ave, Chestnut Hill, MA 02467 USA.",simona.giorgi@bc.edu; klausweber@northwestern.edu,"Weber, Klaus/P-7387-2015; Giorgi, Simona/I-3383-2014","Giorgi, Simona/0000-0002-2905-5107; Weber, Klaus/0000-0002-4460-4733",,,,,150,52,52,2,90,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0001-8392,1930-3815,,ADMIN SCI QUART,Adm.

However, diagnostic procedures in the broader sense have been inadequately theorized to date, with the result that there is still little agreement on precisely what diagnosis in second and foreign language learning actually entails. In order to address this problem, this article investigated how diagnosis is theorized and carried out in a diverse range of professions with a view to finding commonalities that can be applied to the context of language assessment. Ten semi-structured interviews were conducted with professionals from the fields of car mechanics, IT systems support, medicine, psychology and education. Data were then coded, yielding five macro-categories that fit the entire data set: (i) definitions of diagnosis, (ii) means of diagnosis,(iii) key players, (iv) diagnostic procedures, (v) treatment/follow-up. Based on findings within these categories, a set of five tentative principles of diagnostic language assessment is drawn-up, as well as a list of implications for future research.","[Alderson, J.

Yet numerous textsincluding a recently reconstituted work about the law of warshow that he thought very seriously about the question of the nature and origin of war and of the possibility of making war subject to the rule of law. Rousseau, in contrast to Hobbes, links war's appearance to that of the sovereign states; the state of war is therefore the necessary result of international relations. Moreover, he considers the international law as chimerical. How can he then conceive a non-utopian theory of just war? My hypothesis is that his conception of the law of war is deduced from principles of internal political law and arises from pragmatic necessity. The state that discredits itself in its manner of waging war weakens itself while believing that it is reinforcing itself.","Univ Cergy Pontoise, Ctr Philosophie Jurid & Polit, Cergy Pontoise, France",,"Bachofen, B (corresponding author), Univ Cergy Pontoise, Ctr Philosophie Jurid & Polit, Cergy Pontoise, France.",blaise.bachofen@u-cergy.fr,,,,,,,57,4,4,0,9,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0003-0554,1537-5943,,AM POLIT SCI REV,Am.

It analyses the interactional procedures by which the foreign place of origin of the teacher becomes the topic of conversation following his or her initial categorization by the Japanese students, for example, so you are from England'. In doing so, it draws on Maynard and Zimmerman's (1984) analytic framework of pre-topical sequences used by unacquainted participants to uncover other-identifying information. This is reclassified to accommodate the prior knowledge of the Japanese students of the teachers' foreign origins, as emergent in categorization. Having been granted the pre-allocated right to nominate topic through guidelines on use of the lounge, the students further adopt a wanting-to-know framing of conversation, by which they orient to the teacher's own expertise, as rooted in his or her biographical information preserve (Goffman 1971).

The work draws on critical case studies constructed through fieldwork in the United States, the UK and Brazil, and a discourse analysis of civic crowdfunding projects collected from platforms by the author. It offers three provocations to scholars and practitioners considering the practice, questioning the extent to which civic crowdfunding is participatory, the extent to which it addresses or contributes to social inequality, and the extent to which it augments or weakens the role of public institutions. In doing so, it finds that civic crowdfunding is capable of vastly divergent outcomes, and argues that the extent to which civic crowdfunding produces outcomes that are beneficial, rather than harmful to the public sphere, will be determined by the extent to which the full range of stakeholders in civic life participate in the practice.","Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",,"Davies, R (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, 475 Via Ortega, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",rodrigo.davies@gmail.com,,,,,,,49,50,51,1,134,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

Until recently, however, polls rarely included enough questions in a given domain to apply scaling techniques such as IRT models at the individual level, preventing scholars from taking full advantage of historical survey data. To address this problem, we develop a Bayesian group-level IRT approach that models latent traits at the level of demographic and/or geographic groups rather than individuals. We use a hierarchical model to borrow strength cross-sectionally and dynamic linear models to do so across time. The group-level estimates can be weighted to generate estimates for geographic units. This framework opens up vast new areas of research on historical public opinion, especially at the subnational level. We illustrate this potential by estimating the average policy liberalism of citizens in each U.S. state in each year between 1972 and 2012.","[Caughey, Devin; Warshaw, Christopher] MIT, Dept Polit Sci, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",,"Caughey, D (corresponding author), MIT, Dept Polit Sci, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",caughey@mit.edu; cwarshaw@mit.edu,"Warshaw, Christopher/AAM-4838-2021","Caughey, Devin/0000-0001-6419-6805","MIT School of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences","MIT School of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences","The data collection and preparation for this article was supported by a grant from the MIT School of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences.",,42,34,34,0,11,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1047-1987,1476-4989,,POLIT ANAL,Polit.

We examine three different types of ESS: those in which a 'knowing' response is accepted by the initiator of the sequence; those in which there is an 'unknowing' response; and those where 'knowing' responses are contested. The findings have implications for understanding peer interaction in content-based classrooms in three areas: the affordances of peer interaction for learning in contrast with teacher-led 'known-answer' sequences; how learners manage rights and responsibilities around knowing or not knowing; and how learners discover and work on their own learning objects.","[Jakonen, Teppo] Univ Jyvaskyla, Ctr Appl Language Studies, Jyvaskyla, Finland; [Morton, Tom] Univ London, Dept Appl Linguist & Commun, London, England",,"Jakonen, T (corresponding author), Univ Jyvaskyla, Ctr Appl Language Studies, Jyvaskyla, Finland.",teppo.jakonen@jyu.fi,"Morton, Tom/AAA-1243-2020","Morton, Tom/0000-0002-5102-0445; Jakonen, Teppo/0000-0002-7250-0042",project ConCLIL - Language and content integration: towards a conceptual framework; Academy of Finland,project ConCLIL - Language and content integration: towards a conceptual framework; Academy of Finland(Academy of Finland),"This work was supported by the project ConCLIL - Language and content integration: towards a conceptual framework (2011-2014), led by Prof. Tarja Nikula, and funded by the Academy of Finland.

The research builds upon (i) research on multilingual advertising by investigating its attitudinal correlates, and (ii) studies on advertising to bilinguals through the verification of the presence of processing fluency effects among Italian English bilinguals in Australia. Results drawn from a focus group show that attitudes towards the two languages are shaped both by the consideration of the audience's bilingualism and the socio-psychological features the languages carry. Further data collected through a 2 (language of advertisements: English versus Italian) x 2 (language dominance: English versus Italian) between-subject experiment particularize these findings. A total of 103 circumstantial bilinguals of Italian descent evaluated four print advertisements. Arguably due to their high level of proficiency, subjects do not experience any processing fluency effect when exposed to advertising in their dominant language. On the contrary, English dominants respond more favourably to messages in Italian whereas Italian dominants respond more favourably to messages in English.","Univ Sydney, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia",,"Santello, M (corresponding author), Univ Sydney, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",m.santello@sydney.edu.au,,,,,,,94,11,11,2,27,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0142-6001,1477-450X,,APPL LINGUIST,Appl.

J,"Bodker, H",,,,"Bodker, Henrik",,,JOURNALISM AS CULTURES OF CIRCULATION,DIGITAL JOURNALISM,,,English,Article,,,,,,circulation; iconicity; journalism; layering; participation; temporality,NEWS,"The universe of journalism has always consisted of interspersed texts, practices and meanings. Yet, much journalism research has often isolated either texts and/or contexts and thus assumed relations between professional practices, informed (rational) readers and (conceived) core texts. It is, however, more important than ever to shift attention away from texts to the processes through which they are circulated. This is partly because the many cultural forms of journalism (textual, institutional, technological, material, behavioural and imagined) are undergoing significant changes, one of which is being interrelated in new and increasingly complex ways. To understand some of the related processes, this article proposes a notion of circulation that implies a close attention to the ways in which the various forms of this landscape travel, intertwine and connect and, in particular, to the ways in which these forms construct and maintain what is termed cultures of circulation. In order to approach such processes, this article traces the photographic mediation of a specific event with the overall aim of beginning a theorization of the landscape of journalism as interrelated cultures of circulation.","[Bodker, Henrik] Aarhus Univ, Dept Aesthet & Commun, Aarhus C, Denmark",,"Bodker, H (corresponding author), Aarhus Univ, Dept Aesthet & Commun, Aarhus C, Denmark.",imvhb@dac.au.dk,,,,,,,25,15,15,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

Previous research has highlighted how elite media, journalism education institutions, and other interest groups take part in the emergence and evolution of data journalism. But has it equally gained momentum in smaller, less-scrutinized media markets? This paper looks at the ascent of data journalism in the French-speaking part of Belgium. It argues that journalism, and hence data journalism, can be understood as a socio-discursive practice: it is not only the production of (data-driven) journalistic artefacts that shapes the notion of (data) journalism, but also the discursive efforts of all the actors involved, in and out of the newsrooms. A set of qualitative inquiries allowed us to examine the phenomenon by first establishing a cartography of who and what counts as data journalism. It uncovers an overall reliance on a handful of passionate individuals, only partly backed up institutionally, and a limited amount of consensual references that could foster a shared interpretive community. A closer examination of the definitions reveal a sharp polyphony that is particularly polarized around the duality of the term itself, divided between a focus on data and a focus on journalism, and torn between the co-existing notions of ordinary and thorough data journalism. We also describe what is perceived as obstacles, which mostly pertain to broader traits that shape contemporary news-making; and explain why, if data journalism clearly exists as a matter of concern, it has not transformed in concrete undertakings.","[De Maeyer, Juliette] Univ Montreal, Dept Commun, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Libert, Manon; Domingo, David; Heinderyckx, Francois; Le Cam, Florence] Univ Libre Bruxelles, Dept Informat & Commun Sci, Brussels, Belgium; [Heinderyckx, Francois] Commun Univ China, Beijing, Peoples R China",,"De Maeyer, J (corresponding author), Univ Montreal, Dept Commun, Montreal, PQ, Canada.",juliette.de.maeyer@umontreal.ca; manon.libert@ulb.ac.be; david.domingo@ulb.ac.be; fheinder@ulb.ac.be; flecam@ulb.ac.be,"Heinderyckx, Francois/B-6353-2011","Heinderyckx, Francois/0000-0003-3710-6098",,,,,22,75,78,3,35,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

This article explores this idea of de-boundedness and discusses the question whether there is anything more behind it than a catch-all diagnosis for the processes of change and transformation in the circumstances of communication in society, in general, and for journalism, in particular. To this end, de-boundedness as a proposition initially receives a more concrete definition. Its foundations in theories of differentiation and especially in the theory of social systems by the German sociologist Niklas Luhmann will be discussed, where differentiation, that is, drawing lines of demarcation, is the essential factor. It is shown that systems theory provides different possibilities for characterizing forms of de-differentiation or blurring boundaries. Within systems theory they can be interpreted in terms of the evolutionary emergence of new forms of journalism, the co-evolutionary processes between journalism and its environment and/or as interpenetrations of journalism with other societal systems. It is demonstrated that changes in journalism oscillate between differentiation and de-differentiation, so that it can be described as a (de-) differentiated phenomenon.","[Loosen, Wiebke] Univ Hamburg, Hans Bredow Inst Media Res, Hamburg, Germany",,"Loosen, W (corresponding author), Univ Hamburg, Hans Bredow Inst Media Res, Hamburg, Germany.",w.loosen@hans-bredow-institut.de,,"Loosen, Wiebke/0000-0002-2211-2260",,,,,62,24,24,0,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

If off-the-shelf posting software with a built-in spell-checking function is all that need stand between the audience and a stream of fresh-if unmediated-content, is there a future for the technical, practical or even ethical skills that the copy editor brought to journalism? This study uses a lab experiment to address whether and how traditional editing processes affect audience perceptions of the quality, professionalism, and value of news articles. Articles were presented in a mixed design in which participants saw four articles in the edited condition and four in the unedited condition. Results indicate that standard newsroom editing practices have a significant positive effect on a digital audience's perceptions of news quality and of whether material is worth paying for.","[Vultee, Fred] Wayne State Univ, Dept Commun, Detroit, MI 48202 USA",,"Vultee, F (corresponding author), Wayne State Univ, Dept Commun, Detroit, MI 48202 USA.",vulteef@wayne.edu,,"Vultee, Fred/0000-0003-3233-2977",American Copy Editors Society,American Copy Editors Society,The author is grateful to Editor Bob Franklin and the anonymous reviewers for their encouragement and critical eyes and to the American Copy Editors Society for supporting this project with its first research grant.,,36,10,10,0,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.
