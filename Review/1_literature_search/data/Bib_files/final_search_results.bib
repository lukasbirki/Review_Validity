Abstract = {Existing studies focusing on politicians' adoption of Twitter have found
   that they use it primarily as a broadcasting tool. We argue that
   citizens' impolite and/or uncivil behavior is one possible explanation
   for such decisions. Social media conversations are rife with harassment
   and politicians are a prime target. This alters the incentive structure
   of engaging in dialogue on social media. We use Spanish, Greek, German,
   and U.K. candidates' tweets sent during the run-up to the recent
   European Parliament elections, and rely on automated text analysis and
   machine learning methods to measure their level of civility. Our
   contribution is an actor-oriented theory of political dialogue that
   incorporates Twitter's specific affordances, clarifying how and why
   Twitter's democratic promise may be limited.},

Abstract = {With digital journalism and social media producing huge amounts of
   digital content every day, journalism scholars are faced with new
   challenges to describe and analyze the wealth of information. Borrowing
   sophisticated tools and resources from computer science and
   computational linguistics, journalism scholars have started to gain
   insights into the constant information flow and made big data a regular
   feature of the scientific debate. Both deductive (manual and
   semi-automated) and inductive (fully automated) text analysis methods
   are part of this new toolset. In order to make the automated research
   process more tangible and provide an insight into the options available,
   we provide a roadmap of common (semi-) automated options for text
   analysis. We describe the assumptions and workflows of rule-based
   approaches, dictionaries, supervised machine learning, document
   clustering, and topic models. We show that automated methods have
   different strengths that provide different opportunities, enriching-but
   not replacing-the range of manual content analysis methods.},

Abstract = {Sentiment is central to many studies of communication science, from
   negativity and polarization in political communication to analyzing
   product reviews and social media comments in other sub-fields. This
   study provides an exhaustive comparison of sentiment analysis methods,
   using a validation set of Dutch economic headlines to compare the
   performance of manual annotation, crowd coding, numerous dictionaries
   and machine learning using both traditional and deep learning
   algorithms. The three main conclusions of this article are that: (1) The
   best performance is still attained with trained human or crowd coding;
   (2) None of the used dictionaries come close to acceptable levels of
   validity; and (3) machine learning, especially deep learning,
   substantially outperforms dictionary-based methods but falls short of
   human performance. From these findings, we stress the importance of
   always validating automatic text analysis methods before usage.
   Moreover, we provide a recommended step-by-step approach for (automated)
   text analysis projects to ensure both efficiency and validity.},

Abstract = {The complexity and diversity of today's media landscape provides many
   challenges for scholars studying online news consumption. Yet it is
   unclear how news consumers navigate online. Moving forward, we used a
   custom-built browser plug-in-passively tracking Dutch online news
   consumers 24/7-to examine how context (website) and content (news topic)
   features affect patterns of online news consumption. This resulted in a
   data set containing more than one million Web pages, from 175 websites
   (news websites, search engines, social media), collected over 8 months
   in 2017/18. We used automated content analysis to retrieve news topics,
   and estimated Markov chains to detect consumption patterns. Our findings
   indicate that news consumers often directly visit their favorite
   (typically mainstream) news outlet, and continue browsing within that
   outlet. We also found a strong preference for entertainment news over
   any other topic. Although social media often offer entertainment news,
   they are not necessarily the starting point to such news.},

Title = {Ideological Scaling of Social Media Users: A Dynamic Lexicon Approach},
Journal = {POLITICAL ANALYSIS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {26},
Number = {4},
Pages = {457-473},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Words matter in politics. The rhetoric that political elites employ
   structures civic discourse. The emergence of social media platforms as a
   medium of politics has enabled ordinary citizens to express their
   ideological inclinations by adopting the lexicon of political elites.
   This avails to researchers a rich new source of data in the study of
   political ideology. However, existing ideological text-scaling methods
   fail to produce meaningful inferences when applied to the short,
   informal style of textual content that is characteristic of social media
   platforms such as Twitter. This paper introduces the first viable
   approach to the estimation of individual-level ideological positions
   derived from social media content. This method allows us to position
   social media users-be they political elites, parties, or citizens-along
   a shared ideological dimension. We validate the proposed method by
   demonstrating correlation with existing measures of ideology across
   various political contexts and multiple languages. We further
   demonstrate the ability of ideological estimates to capture derivative
   signal by predicting out-of-sample, individual-level voting intentions.
   We posit that social media data can, when properly modeled, better
   capture derivative signal than discrete scales used in more traditional
   survey instruments.},

Journal = {AMERICAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {82},
Number = {6},
Pages = {1188-1213},

Abstract = {Do advocacy organizations stimulate public conversation about social
   problems by engaging in rational debate, or by appealing to emotions? We
   argue that rational and emotional styles of communication ebb and flow
   within public discussions about social problems due to the alternating
   influence of social contagion and saturation effects. These
   ``cognitive-emotional currents{''} create an opportunity structure
   whereby advocacy organizations stimulate more conversation if they
   produce emotional messages after prolonged rational debate or vice
   versa. We test this hypothesis using automated text-analysis techniques
   that measure the frequency of cognitive and emotional language within
   two advocacy fields on Facebook over 1.5 years, and a web-based
   application that offered these organizations a complimentary audit of
   their social media outreach in return for sharing nonpublic data about
   themselves, their social media audiences, and the broader social context
   in which they interact. Time-series models reveal strong support for our
   hypothesis, controlling for 33 confounding factors measured by our
   Facebook application. We conclude by discussing the implications of our
   findings for future research on public deliberation, how social
   contagions relate to each other, and the emerging field of computational
   social science.},

   Multiverse Approach to Understanding News Engagement on Social Media},
Journal = {DIGITAL JOURNALISM},
Abstract = {Social sciences are facing a crisis of replicability, and concerns about
   the confidence in quantitative findings have resulted in an increasing
   interest in open science practices across many fields. In this article
   we introduce scholars of (digital) journalism studies and communication
   science to multiverse analysis while addressing the possible reasons of
   heterogeneity in the findings of research on engagement with news on
   social media. Using the question of which news article characteristics
   predict news engagement on social media, this illustration of the
   multiverse approach shows how different measurement, data processing,
   and modelling choices lead to divergent conclusions. In particular, we
   show how the selection of widely used automated text analysis tools and
   preprocessing steps influence the conclusions drawn from the analysis.
   We also use this illustration to guide interested scholars through the
   different steps of doing a multiverse analysis. More broadly, we
   demonstrate how multiverse analysis can be an open and transparent
   research approach in a field that is increasingly faced with a wide
   range of analytical choices.},

Abstract = {Political communication has become one of the central arenas of
   innovation in the application of automated analysis approaches to
   ever-growing quantities of digitized texts. However, although
   researchers routinely and conveniently resort to certain forms of human
   coding to validate the results derived from automated procedures, in
   practice the actual ``quality assurance{''} of such a ``gold
   standard{''} often goes unchecked. Contemporary practices of validation
   via manual annotations are far from being acknowledged as best practices
   in the literature, and the reporting and interpretation of validation
   procedures differ greatly. We systematically assess the connection
   between the quality of human judgment in manual annotations and the
   relative performance evaluations of automated procedures against true
   standards by relying on large-scale Monte Carlo simulations. The results
   from the simulations con?rm that there is a substantially greater risk
   of a researcher reaching an incorrect conclusion regarding the
   performance of automated procedures when the quality of manual
   annotations used for validation is not properly ensured. Our
   contribution should therefore be regarded as a call for the systematic
   application of high-quality manual validation materials in any political
   communication study, drawing on automated text analysis procedures.},

Title = {Political Polarization on the Digital Sphere: A Cross-platform,
   Over-time Analysis of Interactional, Positional, and Affective
   Polarization on Social Media},

Abstract = {Political polarization on the digital sphere poses a real challenge to
   many democracies around the world. Although the issue has received some
   scholarly attention, there is a need to improve the conceptual precision
   in the increasingly blurry debate. The use of computational
   communication science approaches allows us to track political
   conversations in a fine-grained manner within their natural settings -
   the realm of interactive social media. The present study combines
   different algorithmic approaches to studying social media data in order
   to capture both the interactional structure and content of dynamic
   political talk online. We conducted an analysis of political
   polarization across social media platforms (analyzing Facebook, Twitter,
   and WhatsApp) over 16 months, with close to a quarter million online
   contributions regarding a political controversy in Israel. Our
   comprehensive measurement of interactive political talk enables us to
   address three key aspects of political polarization: (1) interactional
   polarization - homophilic versus heterophilic user interactions; (2)
   positional polarization - the positions expressed, and (3) affective
   polarization - the emotions and attitudes expressed. Our findings
   indicate that political polarization on social media cannot be
   conceptualized as a unified phenomenon, as there are significant
   cross-platform differences. While interactions on Twitter largely
   conform to established expectations (homophilic interaction patterns,
   aggravating positional polarization, pronounced inter-group hostility),
   on WhatsApp, de-polarization occurred over time. Surprisingly, Facebook
   was found to be the least homophilic platform in terms of interactions,
   positions, and emotions expressed. Our analysis points to key conceptual
   distinctions and raises important questions about the drivers and
   dynamics of political polarization online.},

Abstract = {Political scientists often wish to classify documents based on their
   content to measure variables, such as the ideology of political speeches
   or whether documents describe a Militarized Interstate Dispute. Simple
   classifiers often serve well in these tasks. However, if words occurring
   early in a document alter the meaning of words occurring later in the
   document, using a more complicated model that can incorporate these
   time-dependent relationships can increase classification accuracy. Long
   short-term memory (LSTM) models are a type of neural network model
   designed to work with data that contains time dependencies. We
   investigate the conditions under which these models are useful for
   political science text classification tasks with applications to Chinese
   social media posts as well as US newspaper articles. We also provide
   guidance for the use of LSTM models.},

Abstract = {How accurate are survey-based measures of social media use, in
   particular about political topics? We answer this question by linking
   original survey data collected during the U.S. 2016 election campaign
   with respondents' observed social media activity. We use supervised
   machine learning to classify whether these Twitter and Facebook account
   data are content related to politics. We then benchmark our survey
   measures on frequency of posting about politics and the number of
   political figures followed. We find that, on average, our self-reported
   survey measures tend to correlate with observed social media activity.
   At the same time, we also find a worrying amount of individual-level
   discrepancy and problems related to extreme outliers. Our
   recommendations are twofold. The first is for survey questions about
   social media use to provide respondents with options covering a wider
   range of activity, especially in the long tail. The second is for survey
   questions to include specific content and anchors defining what it means
   for a post to be about politics.},

Abstract = {The goal of this research is to make progress towards using supervised
   machine leaming for automated content analysis dealing with complex
   interpretations of text. For Step 1, two humans coded a sub-sample of
   online forum posts for relational uncertainty. For Step 2, we evaluated
   reliability, in which we trained three different classifiers to learn
   from those subjective human interpretations. Reliability was established
   when two different metrics of inter-coder reliability could not
   distinguish whether a human or a machine coded the text on a separate
   hold-out set. Finally, in Step 3 we assessed validity. To accomplish
   this, we administered a survey in which participants described their own
   relational uncertainty/certainty via text and completed a questionnaire.
   After classifying the text, the machine's classifications of the
   participants' text positively correlated with the subjects' own
   self-reported relational uncertainty and relational satisfaction. We
   discuss our results in line with areas of computational communication
   science, content analysis, and interpersonal communication.},

Abstract = {Saudi Arabia has imprisoned and tortured activists, religious leaders,
   and journalists for voicing dissent online. This reflects a growing
   worldwide trend in the use of physical repression to censor online
   speech. In this paper, we systematically examine the consequences of
   imprisoning well-known Saudis for online dissent by analyzing over 300
   million tweets as well as detailed Google search data from 2010 to 2017
   using automated text analysis and crowd-sourced human evaluation of
   content. We find that repression deterred imprisoned Saudis from
   continuing to dissent online. However, it did not suppress dissent
   overall. Twitter followers of the imprisoned Saudis engaged in more
   online dissent, including criticizing the ruling family and calling for
   regime change. Repression drew public attention to arrested Saudis and
   their causes, and other prominent figures in Saudi Arabia were not
   deterred by the repression of their peers and continued to dissent

Abstract = {Automated text analysis methods have made possible the classification of
   large corpora of text by measures such as topic and tone. Here, we
   provide a guide to help researchers navigate the consequential decisions
   they need to make before any measure can be produced from the text. We
   consider, both theoretically and empirically, the effects of such
   choices using as a running example efforts to measure the tone of New
   York Times coverage of the economy. We show that two reasonable
   approaches to corpus selection yield radically different corpora and we
   advocate for the use of keyword searches rather than predefined subject
   categories provided by news archives. We demonstrate the benefits of
   coding using article segments instead of sentences as units of analysis.
   We show that, given a fixed number of codings, it is better to increase
   the number of unique documents coded rather than the number of coders
   for each document. Finally, we find that supervised machine learning
   algorithms outperform dictionaries on a number of criteria. Overall, we
   intend this guide to serve as a reminder to analysts that thoughtfulness
   and human validation are key to text-as-data methods, particularly in an
   age when it is all too easy to computationally classify texts without
   attending to the methodological choices therein.},

Abstract = {This study addresses the issue of sampling biases in social media
   data-driven communication research. The authors demonstrate how
   supervised machine learning could reduce Twitter sampling bias induced
   from ``proxy-population mismatch{''}. Particularly, this study used the
   Random Forest (RF) classifier to disentangle tweet samples
   representative of general publics' activities from non-general-or
   institutional-activities. By applying RF classifier models to Twitter
   data sets relevant to four news events and a randomly pooled dataset,
   the study finds systematic differences between general user samples and
   institutional user samples in their messaging patterns. This article
   calls for disentangling Twitter user samples when ordinary user
   behaviors are the focus of research. It also builds on the development
   of machine learning modeling in the context of communication research.},

Abstract = {What is the role of social media in political agenda setting? Digital
   platforms have reduced the gatekeeping power of traditional media and,
   potentially, they have increased the capacity of various kinds of actors
   to shape the agenda. We study this question in the Swiss context by
   examining the connections between three agendas: the traditional media
   agenda, the social media agenda of parties, and the social media agenda
   of politicians. Specifically, we validate and apply supervised machine
   learning classifiers to categorize 2.78 million articles published in 84
   newspapers, 6,500 tweets posted on official party accounts, and 210,000
   tweets posted by politicians on their own accounts from January 2018
   until December 2019. We first use the classifier to measure the salience
   of the four most relevant issues of the period: the environment, Europe,
   gender equality, and immigration. Then, using a vector autoregression
   (VAR) approach, we analyze the relationship between the three agendas.
   Results show that not only do the traditional media agenda, the social
   media agenda of parties, and the social media agenda of politicians
   influence one another but, overall, no agenda leads the others more than
   it is led by them. There is one important exception: for the environment
   issue, the social media agenda of parties is more predictive of the
   traditional media agenda than vice-versa. These findings underscore how
   closely different agendas are tied together, but also show that advocacy
   campaigns may play an important role in both constraining and enabling
   parties to push their specific agendas.},

Abstract = {The use of social media as a source of news is entering a new phase as
   computer algorithms are developed and deployed to detect, rank, and
   verify news. The efficacy and ethics of such technology is the subject
   of this article, which examines the SocialSensor application, a tool
   developed by a multidisciplinary European Union research project. The
   results suggest that computer software can be used successfully to
   identify trending news stories, allow journalists to search within a
   social media corpus, and help verify social media contributors and
   content. However, such software also raises questions about
   accountability as social media is algorithmically filtered for use by
   journalists and others. Our analysis of the inputs SocialSensor relies
   on shows biases towards those who are vocal and have an audience, many
   of whom are men in the media. We also reveal some of the technology's
   temporal and topic preferences. The conclusion discusses whether such
   biases are necessary for systems like SocialSensor to be effective. The
   article also suggests that academic research has failed to recognise
   fully the changes to journalists' sourcing practices brought about by
   social media, particularly Twitter, and provides some countervailing
   evidence and an explanation for this failure.},

Title = {Computer-Assisted Keyword and Document Set Discovery from Unstructured
   Text},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {61},
Number = {4},
Pages = {971-988},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The (unheralded) first step in many applications of automated text
   analysis involves selecting keywords to choose documents from a large
   text corpus for further study. Although all substantive results depend
   on this choice, researchers usually pick keywords in ad hoc ways that
   are far from optimal and usually biased. Most seem to think that keyword
   selection is easy, since they do Google searches every day, but we
   demonstrate that humans perform exceedingly poorly at this basic task.
   We offer a better approach, one that also can help with following
   conversations where participants rapidly innovate language to evade
   authorities, seek political advantage, or express creativity; generic
   web searching; eDiscovery; look-alike modeling; industry and
   intelligence analysis; and sentiment and topic analysis. We develop a
   computer-assisted (as opposed to fully automated or human-only)
   statistical approach that suggests keywords from available text without
   needing structured data as inputs. This framing poses the statistical
   problem in a new way, which leads to a widely applicable algorithm. Our
   specific approach is based on training classifiers, extracting
   information from (rather than correcting) their mistakes, and
   summarizing results with easy-to-understand Boolean search strings. We
   illustrate how the technique works with analyses of English texts about
   the Boston Marathon bombings, Chinese social media posts designed to
   evade censorship, and others.},

   toward capturing the accuracy of media coverage on public policy, we
   apply both hierarchical dictionary counts and supervised learning to
   measure mass media coverage of change in US defense spending. Both
   approaches appear to do well at capturing a media ``policy signal{''} in
   the area, which provides an important test of convergent validity. While
   the results highlight the value of both dictionary and machine learning
   methods used independently, they also illustrate ways in which the two
   can be used in combination.},

   campaign 2013, this article investigates whether election candidates
   address the topics most important to the mass audience and to which
   extent their communication is shaped by the characteristics of Facebook
   and Twitter. Based on open-ended responses from a representative survey
   conducted during the election campaign, we train a human-interpretable
   Bayesian language model to identify political topics. Applying the model
   to social media messages of candidates and their direct audiences, we
   find that both prioritize different topics than the mass audience. The
   analysis also shows that politicians use Facebook and Twitter for
   different purposes. We relate the various findings to the mediation of

Title = {Enhancing Theory-Informed Dictionary Approaches with ``Glass-box{''}
   Machine Learning: The Case of Integrative Complexity in Social Media
   Comments},
Journal = {COMMUNICATION METHODS AND MEASURES},
Abstract = {Dictionary-based approaches to computational text analysis have been
   shown to perform relatively poorly, particularly when the dictionaries
   rely on simple bags of words, are not specified for the domain under
   study, and add word scores without weighting. While machine learning
   approaches usually perform better, they offer little insight into (a)
   which of the assumptions underlying dictionary approaches (bag-of-words,
   domain transferability, or additivity) impedes performance most, and (b)
   which language features drive the algorithmic classification most
   strongly. To fill both gaps, we offer a systematic assumption-based
   error analysis, using the integrative complexity of social media
   comments as our case in point. We show that attacking the additivity
   assumption offers the strongest potential for improving dictionary
   performance. We also propose to combine off-the-shelf dictionaries with
   supervised ``glass box{''} machine learning algorithms (as opposed to
   the usual ``black box{''} machine learning approaches) to classify texts
   and learn about the most important features for classification. This
   dictionary-plus-supervised-learning approach performs similarly well as
   classic full-text machine learning or deep learning approaches, but
   yields interpretable results in addition, which can inform theory
   development on top of enabling a valid classification.},

Abstract = {This study inductively develops a new conceptual framework for analyzing
   strategic campaign communications across different social media
   platforms through an analysis of candidate social media strategies
   during the 2016 U.S. presidential election cycle. We conducted a series
   of open-ended, in-depth qualitative interviews with campaign
   professionals active during the 2016 presidential cycle. Our analysis
   revealed that scholars need to account for the ways that campaigns
   perceive their candidates in addition to the audiences, affordances, and
   genres of different social media platforms, as well as the timing of the
   electoral cycle, in order to effectively study strategic social media
   communication. Our findings reveal that campaigns proceed from
   perceptions of their candidates' public personae and comfort with
   engagement on social media. Campaigns perceive that social media
   platforms vary according to their audiences, including their
   demographics and other characteristics; with respect to their
   affordances, actual and perceived functionalities; the genres of
   communication perceived to be appropriate to them; and the timing of the
   electoral cycle, which shapes messaging strategies and the utility of
   particular platforms. These factors shape how campaigns use social media
   in the service of their electoral goals. We conclude by developing these
   findings into an analytic framework for future research, arguing that
   researchers should refrain from automatically generalizing the results
   of single-platform studies to social media as a whole, and detailing the
   implications of our findings for future political communication
   research.},

Title = {PRESENTING NEWS ON SOCIAL MEDIA Media logic in the communication style
   of newspapers on Facebook},
Journal = {DIGITAL JOURNALISM},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {7},
Number = {1},
Pages = {45-62},
Abstract = {With the rising popularity of social media as news sources, a new common
   format element for presenting news has emerged: in addition to the
   classic headline, lead and picture, news organizations add a status
   message when they share their news articles on social media such as
   Twitter and Facebook. Based on media logic theory, we argue that the
   communication style of these messages is likely to be more interpersonal
   and subjective. To investigate this we used computational text analysis
   to compare status messages to headlines and leads, covering nine
   newspapers from the Netherlands and Flanders over a period of 2.5 years.
   We conclude that newspapers use status messages to add a subjective
   expression to news on social media, and call for research into how this
   takes shape and affects the audience.},

Title = {Content Analyses of User Comments in Journalism: A Systematic Literature
   Review Spanning Communication Studies and Computer Science},
Journal = {DIGITAL JOURNALISM},
Abstract = {Different disciplines have studied the content of online user comments
   in various contexts, using manual qualitative/quantitative or
   (semi-)automated approaches. The broad spectrum and disciplinary divides
   make it difficult to grasp an overview of those aspects which have
   already been examined, e.g. to identify findings related to one's own
   research, recommendable methodological approaches, and under-researched
   topics. We introduce a systematic literature review concerning content
   analyses of user comments in a journalistic context. Our review covers
   192 papers identified through a systematic search focussing on
   communication studies and computer science. We find that research
   predominantly concentrates on the comment sections of Anglo-American
   newspaper brands and on aspects like hate speech, general incivility, or
   users' opinions on specific issues, while disregarding media from other
   parts of the world, comments in social media, propaganda, and
   constructive comments. From our results we derive a research agenda that
   addresses research gaps and also highlights potentials for automating
   analyses as well as for cooperation across disciplines.},

Abstract = {While scholarly attention has been devoted to social media's potential
   mobilizing function, they may also contribute to demobilization
   discourses: social communication actively promoting nonvoting. This
   paper examines discourses around mobilization vs. demobilization in the
   context of the municipal elections in Jerusalem. As the sweeping
   majority of East Jerusalem Palestinians have continuously been
   boycotting Jerusalem's municipal elections, this is a potent case
   through which to examine how demobilization functions in action, through
   social media conversations. Using a mixed-methods analysis of Twitter
   contents as structured by different languages, our findings show how
   mobilization and demobilization discourses can co-occur during the same
   election event. Users of different languages - reflecting different
   social and political identities - interpret the elections in contrasting
   ways, with tangible implications for (in)equality in political
   participation. The study thus contributes theoretically to several
   domains of political communication, including election studies, local
   politics, and language fragmentation in online political discourse.},

Abstract = {Social media offer an unprecedented opportunity for companies to
   interact more closely with customers and market their products and
   services. But social media also present reputational risks as negative
   word-of-mouth can spread more quickly and widely through these platforms
   than ever before. This study investigates how companies respond to
   customer complaints on Twitter. We propose an innovative mixed methods
   approach (i) to identify the key features that mark the styles used by a
   sample of companies in their replies to customers and (ii) to determine
   the most effective strategies for responding to complaints. Our results
   reveal that an affective style, expressed through devices such as stance
   markers, emphatics, and amplifiers, elicits the most positive response
   from complainants, regardless of the formality of the message. The study
   advances our understanding of the features and effects of corporate
   social media discourse. It also provides business communication
   practitioners with linguistically grounded insights that can inform the
   development of appropriate strategies for dealing with negative
   word-of-mouth online.},

Abstract = {Larger protests are more likely to lead to policy changes than small

   substantiated using cellphone location data from more than 10 million
   individuals during the 2017 United States Women's March protests. These
   cellphone estimates correlate strongly with those provided in news media
   as well as three size estimates generated using geolocated tweets, one
   text-based and two based on images. Inferences about protest attendance
   from these estimates match others' findings about the Women's March.},

   and attitudes. First, we develop a model to estimate the ideology of
   politicians and their supporters using social media data on individual

   place politicians and more than 6 million citizens who are active in
   social media on the same metric. We validate the ideological estimates
   that result from the scaling process by showing they correlate highly
   with existing measures of ideology from Congress, and with
   individual-level self-reported political views. Finally, we use these
   measures to study the relationship between ideology and age, social
   relationships and ideology, and the relationship between friend ideology

Abstract = {This exploratory study examines how participants incidentally consumed
   news on social media through an eye tracking analysis of their visual
   interaction with posts on Facebook. By interaction, we refer to the
   attention participants gave to news (measured through the time devoted
   to looking at the content); how they read these news items (measured
   through ocular movements on the screen); and the way they engaged with
   this content (measured through forms of participation such as liking,
   commenting, or sharing news). The data were triangulated through
   interviews with Facebook users and an analysis of the metrics of posts
   from Costa Rican news organizations on Facebook from 2017 to 2020. We
   draw on scholarship in communication studies and multimodal discourse
   analysis. We argue for a more nuanced approach to what study
   participants did when they incidentally encountered news on social media
   that focuses on mechanisms, that is, the specific procedures and
   operations that shape user interaction with news on Facebook (such as
   visual fixations on parts of news posts; the visual entry points through
   which they begin to interact with the news; the sequences that
   characterize how they navigate content; and the time they spend
   assessing various multimodal elements).},

Abstract = {Why do some politicians employ populist rhetoric more than others within
   the same elections, and why do the same politicians employ more of it in
   some elections? Building on a simple formal theoretical model of
   two-candidate elections informed by the ideational approach to populist
   communication, we argue that the initially less popular political actors
   are more likely to use populist rhetoric in a gamble to have at least
   some chance of winning. To test the empirical implications of our
   argument, we construct the most comprehensive corpus of U.S.
   presidential campaign speeches (1952-2016) and estimate the prevalence
   of populist rhetoric across these speeches with a novel automated text
   analysis method utilizing active learning and word embedding. Overall,
   we show the robustly greater use of populism among the presidential
   candidates with the lower polling numbers regardless of their
   partisanship or incumbency status.},

Abstract = {Internet censorship mechanisms in China are highly dynamic and yet to be
   fully accounted for by existing theories. This study interrogates
   postpublication censorship on Chinese social media by examining the
   differences between 2,280 pairs of censored WeChat articles and matched
   remaining articles. With the effects of account attributes and article
   topics excluded, we find that article specificity raises the odds of
   being censored. Also, an examination on a collection of international
   trade articles indicates that such articles with textual units
   disclosing conflicts, even pro-regime messages, are also removed by the
   censors. This mixed-method study introduces focal point as a theoretical
   angle to understand China's contextually contingent content regulation
   system and offers evidence based on large-scale, nonproprietary, and
   original social media data to investigate the evolving censorship
   mechanisms in China.},

Abstract = {In order to reach its audiences, journalism regularly turns to social
   media to promote its articles. This study sets out to ascertain
   competing communicative logics of Facebook posts as opposed to article
   teasers on news outlets' websites. We look at Scandinavian news outlets
   as a most-similar three-country case with at least a third of all news
   consumers regularly using Facebook for news. The study builds on an
   extensive data collection of all Scandinavian news outlets' Facebook
   posts including their respective websites' article teasers over the
   course of 11 months. We investigate the use of news text grammar (e.g.,
   punctuation or the use of pronouns) and social media features (e.g.,
   hashtags or the use of emojis) alongside structural influences from
   individual countries, outlet reach, and ownership. Findings show
   Facebook posts to include less punctuation while employing more calls to
   action through the use of question and exclamation marks. We conclude
   with a reinvigorated call for hierarchical considerations when
   investigating news outlets' social media endeavours through editors'
   experiences, available resources to a news outlet, and institutional
   willingness to align with audiences.},

Abstract = {Many hoped that social networking sites would allow for the open
   exchange of information and a revival of the public sphere.
   Unfortunately, conversations on social media are often toxic and not
   conducive to healthy political discussions. Twitter, the most widely
   used social network for political discussions, doubled the limit of
   characters in a tweet in November 2017, which provided an opportunity to
   study the effect of technological affordances on political discussions
   using a discontinuous time series design. Using supervised and
   unsupervised natural language processing methods, we analyzed 358,242
   tweet replies to U.S. politicians from January 2017 to March 2018. We
   show that doubling the permissible length of a tweet led to less
   uncivil, more polite, and more constructive discussions online. However,
   the declining trend in the empathy and respectfulness of these tweets
   raises concerns about the implications of the changing norms for the
   quality of political deliberation.},

   information itself is straightforward and factual. In other words, an
   authoritarian government's efforts to disseminate information comes with

   following the 2016 Trending Topics controversy},
Journal = {DIGITAL JOURNALISM},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {6},
Number = {1},
Pages = {4-20},
Abstract = {May 2016, two stories on Facebook's Trending Topics news feature
   appeared on the site Gizmodo, the first exposing the human curators
   working surreptitiously to select news and the second containing
   accusations that certain curators censored conservative voices. These
   revelations led to public outcry, mostly from conservatives upset at
   possible bias and journalists critical of Facebook for its largely
   secretive and haphazard approach to news. This study examines the
   response to the controversy as metajournalistic discourse-talk about
   news that seeks to define appropriate practices and legitimate news
   forms. It identifies a fundamental divergence in the public articulation
   of Facebook's role in the larger news ecosystem. Facebook reacted to the
   controversy by formulating an approach to news as a form of content
   that, like other content on the site, should be personalized, organized
   according to popularity in the form of user engagement, and free of
   editorial control from the social media site. By contrast, journalists
   positioned news as purposively selected and shared while placing
   Facebook as an active participant within the news ecosystem and
   therefore beholden to an enhanced institutional commitment to public
   responsibility.},

Abstract = {Recent scholarship highlights the importance of public discourse for the
   mobilization and impact of social movements, but it neglects how
   cultural products may shift discourse and thereby influence mobilization
   and political outcomes. This study investigates how activism against
   hydraulic fracturing (fracking) utilized cultural artifacts to influence
   public perceptions and effect change. A systematic analysis of Internet
   search data, social media postings, and newspaper articles allows us to
   identify how the documentary Gasland reshaped public discourse. We find
   that Gasland contributed not only to greater online searching about
   fracking, but also to increased social media chatter and heightened mass
   media coverage. Local screenings of Gasland contributed to anti-fracking
   mobilizations, which, in turn, affected the passage of local fracking
   moratoria in the Marcellus Shale states. These results have implications
   not only for understanding movement outcomes, but also for theory and
   research on media, the environment, and energy.},

   generate and promote counterpublic narratives about racial profiling and
   police misconduct. Through a combination of large-scale network analysis
   and qualitative discourse analysis, we detail counterpublic structure
   and leadership, discursive strategies deployed by crowdsourced elites,
   and the reception of counterpublic activism in mainstream media. We
   conclude with implications for understanding the evolving nature of
   counterpublics, with particular consideration to the roles of new and
   old media in ( re) shaping public debates around marginalization,
   profiling, and policing.},

Month = {FEB 7},
Abstract = {This article develops the idea of an ``emotional turn{''} in journalism
   studies, which has led to an increasingly nuanced investigation of the
   role of emotion in the production, texts and audience engagement with
   journalism. These developments have occurred in tandem with, and
   accelerated by, the emergence of digital and social media. Research on
   news production has shown that journalistic work has always taken
   emotion into consideration, shaping approaches to storytelling and
   presentation. However, the view of journalists as detached observers has
   rendered the emotional labor associated with news production invisible.
   Research on emotion in journalistic texts has highlighted the fact that
   even conventional ``hard news genres{''} are shaped by an engagement
   with emotion. As studies on news audiences and emotions have shown,
   audiences are more likely to be emotionally engaged, recall information
   and take action when news stories are relatable. The affordances of
   digital platforms and social media have had a profound impact on the
   space for emotion. The expanded opportunities for participation have
   contributed to questioning traditional distinctions between news
   audiences and producers and have ushered in new and more forms of
   emotional expression that have spilled over into practices of news
   production.},

Abstract = {This study examined how message features and social endorsements affect
   the longevity of audience news sharing by analyzing behavioral data of
   social retransmission of New York Times health news articles, and
   associated article content and context data. The results showed that
   information utility-related message features increased the duration for
   which articles prompted email-based sharing, whereas emotional
   positivity and controversiality increased the longevity of social
   media-based sharing. Expressed emotional evocativeness and the absence
   of death-related words lengthened the duration for which articles
   prompted both email- and social media-based sharing. News
   retransmission, via either email or social media, was more likely to
   persist when the articles stayed on the ``most-emailed{''} list for a
   longer time, showing social endorsement-driven cumulative advantage
   effects. The results further revealed synergistic interaction effects
   between social endorsements and message features. While social
   endorsements produced strong cumulative-advantage effects on the
   longevity of news sharing, articles with certain message features that
   are diagnostic of their inherent share-worthiness generated even
   stronger effects than those articles that appeared on the
   ``most-emailed{''} list for the same amount of time but lacked such
   features. These features were expressed emotional evocativeness
   (email-based sharing), the absence of death-related words, and
   exemplification (social media-based sharing).},

Abstract = {Using Twitter as a case study, this article hypothesizes that social
   media content that is produced on mobile versus web platforms may be
   qualitatively different. As we increasingly tweet from our smartphones,
   we may be encouraged to report on our immediate thoughts, feelings,
   physical self, and surroundings. This article seeks to understand
   whether these presentations of self tend to be more egocentric,
   negative/positive, gendered, or communal depending on whether they were
   tweeted from mobile devices or web platforms. Using 6 weeks of Twitter
   data collected in 2013, we found evidence that users tweet differently
   from mobile devices and that mobile tweeting is informing new behaviors,
   attitudes, and linguistic styles online.},

Abstract = {In digitized media environments, users can access news from all over the
   world. The internationalization of news consumption is intensified by
   social media like Twitter, as users share news from different countries.
   In our study, we combine the two strands of research about media
   repertoires as well as transnational news consumption. Switzerland is a
   compelling case with regard to transnational news consumption as media
   outlets in the three official languages, German, French, and Italian can
   reach audiences in the larger neighbouring countries of Germany, France,
   and Italy. To investigate transnational news consumption, we tracked URL
   shares of Swiss online news media websites for two months on Twitter. We
   then combined this data with the users' followee structures in the
   Twitter network (n = 355,197 tweets, n = 64,170 unique users) and
   inductively detected domestic and foreign audience communities with
   social network analysis. Thus, we were able to identify and compare the
   Twitter news media repertoires of domestic and foreign audience
   communities. Regarding transnational usage patterns, we show that
   especially quality media brands continuously reach audience communities
   in neighbouring countries.},

   motivations, and psychological engagement. Using a mixed-methods design,
   a content analysis of a representative sample of articles published in
   six Chilean outlets was combined with in-depth interviews with digital
   journalists. After controlling for issue, newsworthiness, informational
   utility, valence, and other confounds, results show that-across
   platforms-a morality frame increases news sharing, whereas a conflict
   frame decreases it. Emphasizing economic consequences also decreases
   sharing, but only on Facebook. Surprisingly, the human interest angle
   has no noticeable effects. These results show that news frames can have
   behavioral consequences, and confirm the existence of a gap between
   preferred frames of journalists and users.},

   than 1-sided responses in enhancing altruistic motives for CSR, reducing
   perceived negativity in the public's comments, and eliciting favorable
   attitudes, especially when comments were negative. The effects of
   message sidedness disappeared when the public's comments were positive.
   Results also showed that perceived altruism and negativity mediate the

   arise in the processing, management, translation, and analysis of
   textual data with a particular focus on how procedures differ across
   languages. These procedures are combined in two applied examples of
   automated text analysis using the recently introduced Structural Topic
   Model. We also show how the model can be used to analyze data that have
   been translated into a single language via machine translation tools.
   All the methods we describe here are implemented in open-source software

   work to improve security, but often exacerbate violence. To understand
   why, this article offers a theory about criminal governance in five
   types of criminal regimes-Insurgent, Bandit, Symbiotic, Predatory, and
   Split. These differ according to whether criminal groups confront or
   collude with state actors, abuse or cooperate with the community, and
   hold a monopoly or contest territory with rival OCGs. Police
   interventions in these criminal regimes pose different challenges and
   are associated with markedly different local security outcomes. We
   provide evidence of this theory by using a multimethod research design
   combining quasi-experimental statistical analyses, automated text
   analysis, extensive qualitative research, and a large-N survey in the
   context of Rio de Janeiro's ``Pacifying Police Units{''} (UPPs), which
   sought to reclaim control of the favelas from criminal organizations.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {71},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Broadcast media consumption is becoming more social. Many online video
   ``livestreams{''} come with embedded livestreaming chatboxes, uniting
   the on-screen and social components. We investigate how streaming chat
   shapes perceptions of political events. We conducted a field experiment
   during the September 2019 Democratic Primary Debate where subjects were
   assigned to view the debate with or without streaming chat. We use text
   analyses to characterize the frequency, toxicity, and tone of comments
   in the chat. Our experimental findings indicate that Democratic subjects
   assigned to the Facebook (social) chat condition reported lower affect
   toward Democrats and a worse viewing experience, aligned with the toxic
   and overwhelming nature of the chat. The polarity of candidate-directed
   comments also influenced candidate evaluations and perceived performance
   in the polls. This suggests that consumers of mass media will be both
   more immediately affected by social feedback and likely to make
   inferences about the experiences of their fellow consumers.},

Title = {THE REINVENTED JOURNALIST The discursive construction of professional
   identity on Twitter},
Journal = {DIGITAL JOURNALISM},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {5},
Number = {1},
Pages = {61-81},
Abstract = {Today, there is much academic discussion about how journalism and
   journalists are affected by rapid change and convergence in the work
   context. Considering the fundamental transformations of the media
   ecology brought about by digitization and the advent of social media, it
   has been assumed that journalists are more or less compelled to reinvent
   their professional role and identity. We know a good deal about how
   social media is adopted by journalists, mostly through survey and
   interview studies investigating self-perceptions of identity in terms of
   norms and values. There are also some case studies, predominantly in the
   form of (quantitative) content analyses, exploring the (innovative) uses
   of Twitter. However, we still have little knowledge about how the
   professional identity of journalists is discursively constructed-how, in
   specific detail, traditional norms and ideals are discursively
   reinforced or challenged-in the Twitter flow. With a discourse
   theoretical and methodological approach, this article aims to contribute
   to our understanding of the discursive construction of professional
   identity on Twitter by qualitatively analyzing tweets from the most
   widely followed journalist in Sweden. The analysis of the most active
   j-tweeter can yield important clues as to what journalism may be in the
   process of becoming. The article identifies discourses that (1)
   reinforce the watchdog identity, (2) challenge the watchdog identity,
   (3) reinforce the disseminator/explicator identity, and (4) reinforce
   transparency but challenge professional identity. It concludes that the
   reinvented journalistic identity includes discursive processes that both
   shape and are shaped by Twitter in a dialectical relationship.},

Abstract = {Peace communication in media flows fosters civil discourse, emphasizes
   shared culture, values, collective well-being, and works for reduction

   relations, conflict and public diplomacy, with a focus on the
   understudied case of media flows between India and Pakistan, two
   nuclear-armed nations embroiled in perpetual enmity since the 1947
   Partition. Revolutions in ICTs led to a shift in the dominant media flow
   from top-down and statist to bottom-up, with horizontal media flows
   fostered by individuals and groups now on social media platforms that
   opened up space for civil discourse. Dozens of different online citizen
   groups promoting peace on Facebook, YouTube and other platforms lead to
   the conclusion that peace communication in cross-border media flows
   indeed may have the potential to result in peace dividends in the form
   of fostering civil communication in shared values, culture, and

Volume = {64},
Number = {1},
Pages = {52-66},

Abstract = {How do women gain authority in the public sphere, especially in contexts
   where patriarchal norms are prevalent? I argue that the leaders of
   patriarchal social movements face pragmatic incentives to expand women's
   authority roles when seeking new movement members. Women authorities
   help patriarchal movements by making persuasive, identity-based
   arguments in favor of patriarchy that men cannot, and by reaching new
   audiences that men cannot. I support this argument by examining the rise
   of online female preachers in the Islamist Salafi movement, using
   interviews, Twitter analysis, and automated text analysis of 21,000
   texts by 172 men and 43 women on the Salafi-oriented website saaid.net.
   To show the theory's generality, I also apply it to the contemporary
   white nationalist movement in the United States. The findings illustrate
   how movements that aggressively enforce traditional gender roles for
   participants can nevertheless increase female authority for pragmatic
   political reasons.},

   on Twitter after Germanwings accident},
Journal = {DIGITAL JOURNALISM},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {7},
Number = {6},
Pages = {762-782},
Abstract = {Social media has been increasingly used to gather and share news stories
   from mainstream news sites. This article aims to extend the analysis to
   the public interactions between citizens and media on Twitter after the
   airplane accident of Germanwings' flight 9525, in which citizens'
   eyewitnessing role was minimized. Thematic and interpretative analysis
   have been carried out of 70,000 messages posted on Twitter with the
   hashtag \#germanwings during the three days after the crash. Results
   point towards a hegemonic position of accounts connected to news media
   (mainstream, but also local and specialized outlets) in what regards
   public interactions in Twitter. However, findings also suggest that this
   central position coexists with an important role of the ``common{''}
   citizen in shaping both the agenda of issues that are going to be
   covered but also the particular narratives and discourses associated to
   these issues. Furthermore, results also reflect how Twitter users were
   active in auditing the work of news media, criticising some of the
   approaches of their coverage that they considered to be negligent,
   unprofessional or unethical, performing as watchdogs of professional
   journalists and news media.},

Abstract = {This article brings together perspectives from digital media studies and
   journalism scholarship to propose a working definition of digital
   journalism that can guide scholarship and applied research in this
   field. We define digital journalism as ``those practices of
   newsgathering, reporting, textual production and ancillary communication
   that reflect, respond to, and shape the social, cultural and economic
   logics of the constantly changing digital media environment.{''} We
   elaborate and illustrate this definition through a discussion of the
   co-evolving relationship of journalism with the Internet and social
   media platforms since the 2000s and outline in detail how social news
   outlets such as BuzzFeed are paradigmatic examples of these dynamics and
   relationships. The article concludes by emphasizing the urgent need for
   both the study and practice of digital journalism in the public
   interest, especially in the context of an increasingly platformed and
   closed media system. We focus particularly on the methodological
   challenges and threat to public oversight that recent moves to platform
   enclosure and lockdown represent and provide some suggestions as to how
   these might be addressed.},

Abstract = {Given the scale of digital communication, researchers face a painful
   trade-off between powerful, scalable computational strategies, and the
   theoretical sensitivity offered by small-scale manual analyses.
   Especially in the study of natural discourse on digital media, the
   interactive, ever-evolving stream of conversations across multiple
   platforms regularly defies efforts to obtain well-defined samples of
   manageable size, while their linguistic variability imposes major
   limitations upon the accuracy of automated tools. In this paper, we draw
   upon recent advances in computational text analysis to develop a hybrid
   approach to the deductive analysis of large-scale digital discourse,
   which combines the algorithmic extraction of coherent, recurrent
   patterns with a manual coding of identified patterns. The approach
   scales up to treat millions of texts at minimal added human effort,
   while affording researchers close control over the process of
   theory-guided classification. We demonstrate the power of Hybrid Content
   Analysis by studying polarization in a quarter of a million
   contributions from cross-platform interactive social media discourse

   on the codebook of the Comparative Agendas Project. The classification
   of the imbalanced classes of topics was handled by a hybrid binary
   snowball workflow. This relies on limited human resources as well as
   supervised learning; it simplifies the multiclass problem to one of
   binary choice; and it is based on a snowball approach as we augment the
   training set with machine-classified observations after each successful
   round and also between corpora. Our results show that our approach
   provided better precision results (of over 80\% for most topic codes)
   than what is customary for human coders and most computer-assisted
   coding projects. Nevertheless, this high precision came at the expense
   of a relatively low, below 60\%, share of labeled articles.},

Abstract = {Recent work on the history of political thought, exploiting digital
   resources, is challenging the idea that empirically and hermeneutically
   minded political scientists must work independently in silos. Work by
   students of the Cambridge School and work by textual data miners are
   showing the way toward a new hermeneutical circle-one in which
   empirically and hermeneutically minded political scientists can use
   digital resources to analyze diverse texts and make groundbreaking
   discoveries on relationships between textual uses of language and
   political change. I analyze this new trend toward different sorts of
   political scientists using digital resources to study ideas, to outline
   underlying paradigms relating language and politics in these respective
   fields, and to consider how they could be brought into productive
   conversation. I then consider how such conversation would enrich
   subdisciplinary understandings of the role of language in politics.
   Ultimately, I use this analysis to generate a broader model for how
   empirically and hermeneutically inclined political scientists can
   benefit from collaboration in the age of digital humanities.},

Abstract = {Though prior studies have analyzed the textual characteristics of online
   comments about politics, less is known about how selection into
   commenting behavior and exposure to other people's comments changes the
   tone and content of political discourse. This article makes three
   contributions. First, we show that frequent commenters on Facebook are
   more likely to be interested in politics, to have more polarized
   opinions, and to use toxic language in comments in an elicitation task.
   Second, we find that people who comment on articles in the real world
   use more toxic language on average than the public as a whole; levels of
   toxicity in comments scraped from media outlet Facebook pages greatly
   exceed what is observed in comments we elicit on the same articles from
   a nationally representative sample. Finally, we demonstrate
   experimentally that exposure to toxic language in comments increases the
   toxicity of subsequent comments.},

Title = {EXPLORING MACHINE LEARNING TO STUDY THE LONG-TERM TRANSFORMATION OF NEWS
   Digital newspaper archives, journalism history, and algorithmic
   transparency},
Journal = {DIGITAL JOURNALISM},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {6},
Number = {9, SI},
Pages = {1150-1164},
Abstract = {The labour-intensive nature of manual content analysis and the
   problematic accessibility of source material make quantitative analyses
   of news content still scarce in journalism history. However, the
   digitization of newspaper archives now allows for innovative digital
   methods for systematic longitudinal research beyond the scope of
   incidental case studies. We argue that supervised machine learning
   offers promising approaches to analyse abundant source material, ground
   analyses in big data, and map the structural transformation of
   journalistic discourse longitudinally. By automatically analysing form
   and style conventions, that reflect underlying professional norms and
   practices, the structure of news coverage can be studied more closely.
   However, automatically classifying latent and period-specific coding
   categories is highly complex. The structure of digital newspaper
   archives (e.g. segmentation, OCR) complicates this even more, while
   machine learning algorithms are often a black box. This paper shows how
   making classification processes transparent enables journalism scholars
   to employ these computational methods in a reliable and valid way. We
   illustrate this by focusing on the issues we encountered with
   automatically classifying news genres, an illuminating but particularly
   complex coding category. Ultimately, such an approach could foster a
   revision of journalism history, particularly the often hypothesized but
   understudied shift from opinion-based to fact-centred reporting.},

Title = {Partisan Polarization Is the Primary Psychological Motivation behind
   Political Fake News Sharing on Twitter},
Journal = {AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {115},
Number = {3},
Pages = {999-1015},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The rise of ``fake news{''} is a major concern in contemporary Western
   democracies. Yet, research on the psychological motivations behind the
   spread of political fake news on social media is surprisingly limited.
   Are citizens who share fake news ignorant and lazy? Are they fueled by
   sinister motives, seeking to disrupt the social status quo? Or do they
   seek to attack partisan opponents in an increasingly polarized political
   environment? This article is the first to test these competing
   hypotheses based on a careful mapping of psychological profiles of over
   2,300 American Twitter users linked to behavioral sharing data and
   sentiment analyses of more than 500,000 news story headlines. The
   findings contradict the ignorance perspective but provide some support
   for the disruption perspective and strong support for the partisan
   polarization perspective. Thus, individuals who report hating their
   political opponents are the most likely to share political fake news and
   selectively share content that is useful for derogating these opponents.
   Overall, our findings show that fake news sharing is fueled by the same
   psychological motivations that drive other forms of partisan behavior,
   including sharing partisan news from traditional and credible news
   sources.},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Every time a major violent act takes place in the United States, a
   public debate erupts as to whether it should be considered terrorism.
   Political scientists have offered a variety of conceptual frameworks,
   but have neglected to explore how ordinary citizens understand
   terrorism, despite the central role the public plays in our
   understanding of the relationship between terrorism and government
   action in the wake of violence. We synthesize components of both
   scholarly definitions and public debates to formulate predictions for
   how various attributes of incidents affect the likelihood they are
   perceived as terrorism. Combining a conjoint experiment with machine
   learning techniques and automated content analysis of media coverage, we
   show the importance not only of the type and severity of violence, but
   also the attributed motivation for the incident and social
   categorization of the actor. The findings demonstrate how the language
   used to describe violent incidents, for which the media has considerable
   latitude, affects the likelihood the public classifies incidents as
   terrorism.},

Abstract = {The integration of social science with computer science and engineering
   fields has produced a new area of study: computational social science.
   This field applies computational methods to novel sources of digital
   data such as social media, administrative records, and historical
   archives to develop theories of human behavior. We review the evolution
   of this field within sociology via bibliometric analysis and in-depth
   analysis of the following subfields where this new work is appearing
   most rapidly: (a) social network analysis and group formation; (b)
   collective behavior and political sociology; (c) the sociology of
   knowledge; (d) cultural sociology, social psychology, and emotions; (e)
   the production of culture; ( f) economic sociology and organizations;
   and (g) demography and population studies. Our review reveals that
   sociologists are not only at the center of cutting-edge research that
   addresses longstanding questions about human behavior but also
   developing new lines of inquiry about digital spaces as well. We
   conclude by discussing challenging new obstacles in the field, calling
   for increased attention to sociological theory, and identifying new
   areas where computational social science might be further integrated
   into mainstream sociology.},

   Organizatioihai Factors on Distiosure Clarity},
Journal = {DIGITAL JOURNALISM},
Abstract = {Building on the field theory, this study examined how disclosure of
   native advertising at popular U.S. news websites may relate to their
   organizations' positions in the journalistic field. The study found
   divergent disclosure practices across websites, between language and
   visual disclosures, and between native ad links on the homepage and
   native ad posts on story pages within a website. Overall, older
   organizations with more Pulitzer awards and younger organizations with
   relatively more Pulitzer awards and social media followers seemed to
   execute clearer disclosure. Moreover, the organizations with more
   Pulitzer awards seemed to impose a clearer disclosure language on native
   ad links at gateway locations than those with fewer awards but lessened
   disclosure of native ad posts on the landing pages. The older news
   websites with more social media followers adopted an obscurer disclosure
   language of native ad links but distinguished native ad posts more once
   audiences landed on the content page. This study recommends media effect
   scholars take a holistic approach to assess ad recognition and suggest
   publishers build on cultural capital as an ultimate defense against
   heteronomous forces.},

Abstract = {Do parties change their platform in anticipation of electoral losses? Or
   do parties respond to experienced losses at the previous election? These
   questions relate to two mechanisms to align public opinion with party
   platforms: (1) rational anticipation, and (2) electoral performance.
   While extant work empirically tested, and found support for, the latter
   mechanism, the effect of rational anticipation has not been put to an
   empirical test yet. We contribute to the literature on party platform
   change by theorizing and assessing how party performance motivates
   parties to change their platform in-between elections. We built a new
   and unique dataset of >20,000 press releases issued by 15 Dutch national
   political parties that were in parliament between 1997 and 2014.
   Utilizing automated text analysis (topic modeling) to measure parties'
   platform change, we show that electoral defeat motivates party platform
   change in-between elections. In line with existing findings, we
   demonstrate that parties are backward-looking.},

Journal = {POLITICAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {38},
Number = {6},
Pages = {647-671},
Month = {NOV 2},
Abstract = {The increasing spread of false stories ({''}fake news{''}) represents
   one of the great challenges societies face in the 21st century. A
   little-understood aspect of this phenomenon and of the processing of
   online news in general is how sources influence whether people believe
   and share what they read. In contrast to the predigital era, the
   Internet makes it easy for anyone to imitate well-known and credible
   sources in name and appearance. In a preregistered survey experiment, we
   first investigate the effect of this contrast (real vs. fake source) and
   find that subjects, as expected, have a higher tendency to believe and a
   somewhat higher propensity to share news by real sources. We then expose
   subjects to a number of reports manipulated in content (congruent vs.
   incongruent with individuals' attitudes), which reveals our most crucial
   finding. As predicted, people are more likely to believe a news report
   by a source that has previously given them congruent information.
   However, this only holds if the source is fake. We further use machine
   learning to uncover treatment heterogeneity. Effects vary most strongly
   for different levels of trust in the mainstream media and having voted
   for the populist right.},

Title = {Invisible Friend or Foe?How Journalists Use and Perceive
   Algorithmic-Driven Tools in Their Research Process},
Journal = {DIGITAL JOURNALISM},
Abstract = {The use of algorithmic tools by journalists for information-gathering
   has received particular attention in recent years. While it might
   facilitate the research process, there are also concerns about their
   impact on journalism. Based on reconstruction interviews with 27
   journalists, we first answer the primary question to what extent
   journalists actually use algorithmic-driven tools for research purposes.
   Then, we analyze which folk theories journalists create during their use
   of algorithm-driven tools. Results show that algorithmic tools
   specifically designed for the journalistic research process are rarely
   or not at all used. Yet, more crucially, search engines and social
   media, that are driven by algorithms, play a major role when it comes to
   the search, selection, and verification of sources and information.
   However, journalists are not aware of this hidden research assistant
   facilitating their research process. When explicitly asked, they profess
   specific notions regarding the use of algorithmic-driven tools in the
   form of folk theories, which are predominantly negative regarding the
   influence of AI on journalism. At the same time, there is a still a
   strong feeling of a professional authority among journalists who feel
   they are able to work autonomously of any kind of influence, including
   algorithms.},

Title = {Loopholes in the Echo Chambers: How the Echo Chamber Metaphor
   Oversimplifies the Effects of Information Gateways on Opinion Expression},
Journal = {DIGITAL JOURNALISM},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Number = {5},
Pages = {660-686},
Month = {MAY 28},
Abstract = {Social media (SM) are often regarded drivers of personalized echo
   chambers in which only ideas resonante that individuals already hold,
   leading to more extreme opinions and intensified opinion expression.
   However, recent theorizing and evidence has cast doubts on the universal
   applicability of the echo chamber metaphor, pointing out that
   communication effects on opinion expression are much more complex than
   the metaphor suggests. Using the refugee crisis in Germany as a
   background, the current study challenges four implicit premises of the
   echo chamber metaphor empirically. The findings show a more complex
   picture than the metaphor implies: (1) Ignoring other information
   sources beyond SM may lead to severe misinterpretations; seeming
   evidence for echo chambers disappears after controlling for news media
   use. (2) SM reliance does not generally stimulate opinion expression.
   (3) Attitude extremity moderates the effect of SM reliance, suggesting
   that people with more extreme views are susceptible to echo chamber
   effects. (4) Attitude position on the issue-at-hand moderates the effect
   of SM reliance, which suggests that echo chambers do not completely
   shield their users from the public discourse. We propose the Echo
   Chamber Continuum (ECCo) Model to stimulate developing the echo chamber
   metaphor into a theory suitable for studying opinion formation.},

Title = {Sentiment is Not Stance: Target-Aware Opinion Classification for
   Political Text Analysis},
Journal = {POLITICAL ANALYSIS},
Abstract = {Sentiment analysis techniques have a long history in natural language
   processing and have become a standard tool in the analysis of political
   texts, promising a conceptually straightforward automated method of
   extracting meaning from textual data by scoring documents on a scale
   from positive to negative. However, while these kinds of sentiment
   scores can capture the overall tone of a document, the underlying
   concept of interest for political analysis is often actually the
   document's stance with respect to a given target-how positively or
   negatively it frames a specific idea, individual, or group-as this
   reflects the author's underlying political attitudes. In this paper, we
   question the validity of approximating author stance through sentiment
   scoring in the analysis of political texts, and advocate for greater
   attention to be paid to the conceptual distinction between a document's
   sentiment and its stance. Using examples from open-ended survey
   responses and from political discussions on social media, we demonstrate
   that in many political text analysis applications, sentiment and stance
   do not necessarily align, and therefore sentiment analysis methods fail
   to reliably capture ground-truth document stance, amplifying noise in
   the data and leading to faulty conclusions.},

Abstract = {This article explores the changing roles of Social Media Editors (SMEs)
   in the field of journalism, focusing on their unique position as
   mediators between online news consumers, marketing departments, and
   newsrooms. Based on in-depth interviews, our findings suggest that, far
   beyond their origins as comment field moderators, SMEs now play a
   crucial role in integrating complex behavioral data from social network
   sites and circulating this data in the newsroom to align news production
   with perceived audience tastes. Our findings also suggest that while
   SMEs identify with traditional norms of professional journalism, they
   also work closely with staff in marketing departments and draw on
   marketing language and imagery when describing their work. Ultimately,
   we find that our SME participants experience their increasingly central
   role in the newsroom in contradictory and ambivalent ways, at times
   defending traditional professional values, while at other times voicing
   support for audience sovereignty and giving readers what they want. In
   this way, if Pierre Bourdieu's field theory suggests that journalism is
   structured by an ongoing struggle between exogeneous (commercial and
   marketing) logics and endogenous professional values, the changing roles
   of SMEs indicate the arrival of a new stage in this struggle - a stage
   marked by the deep and virtually uncontested advance of marketing
   terminology and goals into the journalistic field. In this restructured
   professional field, individual SMEs are thus left with the difficult
   task of reconciling, at the level of habitus, internalized tensions
   between ascendant marketing imperatives and residual but still-cherished
   journalistic dispositions and values.},

Abstract = {The problem of trolls exemplifies the challenges of building democratic
   communities in the digital environment of social media. Distinguishing
   trolls from activists can be difficult; democratic theorists have yet to
   adequately address how to prevent the former while remaining open to the
   latter. In this article, I outline a theory of democratic politics that
   takes space as a central element in shaping democratic interactions.
   Using the work of John Dewey, I draw out two key characteristics of
   democratic space: boundedness and flexibility. Using these criteria, I
   then evaluate Kinja, Gawker Media's commenting platform, both before and
   after trolls attacked the site in 2014. I find that in altering its
   boundaries to successfully protect against trolls, Kinja introduced a
   new problem: a lack of flexibility that continues to affect the
   possibility for democratic discourse on the platform. I conclude by
   suggesting how this theory of democratic space might shape future

   is particularly well-suited to this task, but existing matching methods
   are ill-equipped to handle high-dimensional text data. Our proposed
   solution is to estimate a low-dimensional summary of the text and
   condition on this summary via matching. We propose a method of text
   matching, topical inverse regression matching, that allows the analyst
   to match both on the topical content of confounding documents and the
   probability that each of these documents is treated. We validate our
   approach and illustrate the importance of conditioning on text to
   address confounding with two applications: the effect of perceptions of
   author gender on citation counts in the international relations
   literature and the effects of censorship on Chinese social media users.},

Abstract = {Social media giants stand accused of facilitating illegitimate
   interference with democratic political processes around the world. Part
   of this problem are malicious bots: automated fake accounts passing as
   humans. However, we lack a systematic understanding of which politicians
   benefit most from them. We tackle this question by leveraging a Twitter
   purge of malicious bots in July 2018 and a new dataset on Twitter
   activity by all members of national parliaments (MPs) in the EU in 2018.
   Since users had no influence on how and when Twitter purged millions of
   bots, it serves as an exogenous intervention to investigate whether some
   parties or politicians lost more followers. We find drops in follower
   counts concentrated among radical right politicians, in particular those
   with strong anti-EU discourse. This is the first set of empirical,
   causally identified evidence supporting the idea that the radical right
   benefits more from malicious bots than other party families.},

Abstract = {Social media like Twitter have become critical tools for public
   discourse and journalistic practice as they are assumed to enable equal
   conversations and engagement between different societal actors. However,
   recent studies have found that Twitter reproduces existing networks and
   hierarchies, indicated through homophily where dominant journalistic
   users with high symbolic capital tend to amplify and engage more with
   colleagues of similar symbolic status, which legitimizes their authority
   and dominance in the public sphere. Still, an in-depth understanding of
   how this manifests and might be rectified is lacking. To fill this gap,
   we explore the tweeting behaviour of 356 journalists in Austria, as
   social capital and personal networks are especially relevant to be
   recognized by peers. Our findings show strong homophilous tweeting
   behaviour for those with high professional reputation and for men. New
   entrants aim more towards gaining visibility in these tight-knit groups.},

Abstract = {Legacy media coverage of the Civil Rights Movement often highlighted
   charismatic male leaders, such as Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., while
   scores of Black women worked quietly in the background. Today's leaders
   of the modern Black Lives Matter movement have turned this paradigm on
   its face. This case study explores the revamped communication styles of
   four Black feminist organizers who led the early Black Lives Matter
   Movement of 2014: Brittany Ferrell, Alicia Garza, Brittany Packnett, and
   Marissa Johnson. Additionally, the study includes Ieshia Evans: a
   high-profile, independent, anti-police brutality activist. In a series
   of semi-structured interviews, the women shared that their keen textual
   and visual dismantling of Black respectability politics led to a
   mediated hyper-visibility that their forebearers never experienced. The
   women share the advantages and disadvantages of this approach, and weigh
   in on the sustainability of their communication methods for future Black
   social movements.},

Journal = {DIGITAL JOURNALISM},

Pages = {251-272},
Abstract = {The internet and social media have led to a change in the structure of
   the public sphere in comparison to traditional mass media. On the
   internet, private actors have the possibility to participate in public
   discourse and bypass news media to directly interact with each other as
   well as with public actors such as political representatives. The
   questions of the type of interaction, the degree of influence, and
   possible topic-specific differences, however, remain unclear. We
   conducted a content analysis of the user types, forms of interaction,
   and practices of retweeting and linking in 17,629 tweets on five topics
   and found topic-specific differences in the interaction between news
   media, public actors, and private actors. Overall, news media still hold
   an important role in information flow and are linked to and retweeted
   most often by all user types. However, in crisis situations, the
   messages of private actors also find uptake.},

Title = {Networked Flak in CNN and Fox News Memes on Instagram},
Journal = {DIGITAL JOURNALISM},
Abstract = {In this study, we used a multimodal method to examine a visual dataset
   posted on Instagram that references \#CNN and \#FoxNews. Using visual
   analysis, we inductively categorized the memes into nine major types and
   identified the most referenced hashtags associated with these memes. Our
   method provided more insight into the different meanings of memes.
   Building on the theoretical concept of networked flak, the findings
   indicate that Instagram memes which mention CNN and Fox News are often
   politically polarizing and largely critical of these two news channels,
   especially CNN (25.4\%) and to a lesser extent Fox News (15.6\%). We
   argue that routinely trolling news channels creates a polarized
   political environment and is meant to put pressure on journalists which,
   if successful, could potentially influence them.},

   narratives. Yet the dynamics of time have received insufficient
   scholarly attention. In this study, I focus on how temporal
   plasticity-the dynamic employment of time-affects the construction of
   meaning in news media and social media. I draw empirical evidence from a
   cross-media computational text analysis of TV news and Twitter discourse
   in the 2016 American election. The study uncovers the dynamic
   utilization of time and its impact on the democratic meaning of the 2016
   election (or the lack thereof) before, during, and after the election in
   ``old{''} and ``new{''} media. I find that a chronological temporal
   discourse on Twitter facilitates democratic meaning after the election,
   while a fragmented temporal discourse on the news media undermines the
   democratic meaning of the election. The results are discussed in light
   of the democratic role of ``old{''} and ``new{''} media.},

Abstract = {In this paper I discuss the interdisciplinarity of computational

   Scholars are increasingly using text-as-data methods for social science
   inquiry, driving a need for more training and professionalization of
   computational political communication as a sub-field. Text-as-data
   methods are largely borrowed from other disciplines such as linguistics
   and computer science, but sustained, institutionalized collaboration
   between scholars in different departments is still somewhat rare. Using
   the concept of cohesion as an example, I describe how multiple
   disciplines interpret and operationalize the same term in different
   ways. Finally, I provide a list of challenges and lessons learned,
   including the logistics of running a lab, communicating and publishing
   across disciplines, implications of authorship sequence, and maintaining
   your own research profile while collaborating. I conclude by discussing
   the role of meaningful mentorship and future directions for

   comment control) x 4 (topic type: policy vs. international vs. health
   vs. sports) between-subjects design using a convenience sample recruited
   from Amazon Mechanical Turk (N = 230). Results revealed that negative
   comments decreased news credibility and issue importance through the
   mediating pathway of decreased bandwagon support. The pattern of results
   was particularly strong among comments perceived as vivid and authentic,

Title = {The Boy, Who Wanted Broccoli: Alternative News and Acts of Citizenship
   within New Mediascapes},
Journal = {DIGITAL JOURNALISM},
Abstract = {This article explores how acts of citizenship are negotiated across
   populist, political, and networked mediascapes. This is done through a
   discursive analysis of rights-claims originating in a YouTube video
   depicting a young boy, who is denied broccoli at a refugee detainment
   and repatriation centre in Denmark. Besides the video the data consists
   of digital views and comments, texts sourced from citizen media
   publications, social media sites, digitally born and mainstream media.
   We make a distinction between alternative/citizen media, digitally born
   and mainstream media to examine how different types of media play a role
   in discursively constructing populist logics. Our key findings show that
   alternative/citizen media forward political acts and rights-claims for
   the people by the people, whereas mainstream media generally invite
   elite sources to speak for the people. Finally, digitally born media
   encompass elements of both, thus questioning journalistic boundaries.
   The networked media thereby produce the discursive construction of ``the
   rights of the people{''} as an empty signifier.},

Abstract = {This article offers a first subnational analysis of the relationship
   between states' dynamic control of Internet access and their use of
   violent repression. I argue that where governments provide Internet
   access, surveillance of digital information exchange can provide
   intelligence that enables the use of more targeted forms of repression,
   in particular in areas not fully controlled by the regime. Increasing
   restrictions on Internet accessibility can impede opposition
   organization, but they limit access to information on precise targets,
   resulting in an increase in untargeted repression. I present new data on
   killings in the Syrian conflict that distinguish between targeted and
   untargeted events, using supervised text classification. I find that
   higher levels of Internet accessibility are associated with increases in
   targeted repression, whereas areas with limited access experience more
   indiscriminate campaigns of violence. The results offer important
   implications on how governments incorporate the selective access to
   communication technology into their strategies of coercion.},

Volume = {13},

Abstract = {Wordscores is a popular computational text analysis method with numerous
   applications in communication research. Wordscores claims to scale
   documents on specified dimensions without requiring researchers to read
   or even understand the language of the input text. We investigate
   whether Wordscores delivers this claim by scaling the Euromanifestos of
   117 political parties across 23 countries on 4 salient dimensions of
   political conflict. We assess validity by comparing the Wordscores
   estimates to expert surveys and other judgmental measures, and by
   examining the Wordscores's estimates ability to predict party membership
   in the European Parliament groups. We find that the Wordscores estimates
   correlate poorly with expert and judgmental measures of party positions,
   while the latter outperform Wordscores in the predictive validity test.
   We conclude that Wordscores does not live up to its original claim of a
   ``quick and easy{''} language blind method, and urge researchers to
   demonstrate the validity of the method in their domain of interest
   before any empirical analysis.},

   responsiveness are detected and categorized using latent Dirichlet
   allocation, we utilize the terms that comprise the topics, together with
   a gradient descent solver, to assess the classifier's predictive
   accuracy. Using 10,597 documents from the official websites of radical
   right and ethnic political parties in Slovakia (2004-2014), the analysis
   predicts which political issues will elicit partisan reactions, and
   which will be ignored, with an accuracy of 83\% (F-measure) and
   outperforms both Random Forest and Naive Bayes classifiers. Subject

Title = {Logics of Exclusion: How Ukrainian Audiences Renegotiate Propagandistic
   Narratives in Times of Conflict},
Journal = {POLITICAL COMMUNICATION},
Abstract = {Contemporary media environments are rife with contested information.
   Unable to rely on contradictory or deliberately distorted media
   accounts, socially interactive audiences turn to trustworthy others to
   make sense of the political world outside. This study uses the context
   of the Russian-Ukrainian conflict, marked by discordant media agendas
   and ideological narratives, to explore how citizens produce shared
   understandings of conflicting political issues. It draws upon a series
   of focus groups with media audiences in Eastern Ukraine to explore the
   socially embedded, interactive reconstruction and renegotiation of
   shared meaning. Based on a discourse and conversation analysis of the
   content, group dynamics, and non-verbal cues in the discussions, the
   study distinguishes three interaction modes (inquiry, narrative, and
   avoidance) that define the conditions for audiences' opinion formation.
   The findings show that cooperation in inquiry mode facilitates
   deliberation, the adoption of rigid consensual boundaries in narrative
   mode increases polarization, whereas cynical detachment in avoidance
   mode preserves confusion. The article concludes by discussing the
   implications for socially mediated meaning-making and democratic
   potential of political talk.},

Abstract = {The analysis of political texts from parliamentary speeches, party
   manifestos, social media, or press releases forms the basis of major and

   regularly transcribed, and their on-demand transcription by humans is
   prohibitively expensive for research purposes. This class includes
   political speech in certain legislatures, during political party
   conferences as well as television interviews and talk shows. We showcase
   how scholars can use automatic speech recognition systems to analyze
   such speech with quantitative text analysis models of the bag-of-words
   variety. To probe results for robustness to transcription error, we
   present an original word error rate simulation (WERSIM) procedure
   implemented in

Abstract = {Scholarship on media events has rarely considered how interpersonal

   several structural-interactional features of the show encourage viewers

   companions of the contestants. We analyze this shift through the lens of
   mediated ``public intimacy{''}-the staging of exclusive interactions in
   front of a third party. The emergent sense of collective complicity
   affects everyday interactions between viewers and public discourse on
   social media. We conclude that beyond the public staging of self, it is
   the staging and concretization of social relations in media events that
   serves to reaffirm the collective's solidarity.},

Abstract = {This article studies the consequences of digital surveillance in
   dictatorships. I first develop an informational theory of repression and
   co-optation. I argue that digital surveillance resolves dictators'
   information problem of not knowing individual citizens' true anti-regime
   sentiments. By identifying radical opponents, digital surveillance
   enables dictators to substitute targeted repression for nonexclusive
   co-optation to forestall coordinated uprisings. My theory implies that
   as digital surveillance technologies advance, we should observe a rise
   in targeted repression and a decline in universal redistribution. Using
   a difference-in-differences design that exploits temporal variation in
   digital surveillance systems among Chinese counties, I find that
   surveillance increases local governments' public security expenditure
   and arrests of political activists but decreases public goods provision.
   My theory and evidence suggest that improvements in governments'
   information make citizens worse off in dictatorships.},

   breeding ground for the uncontrolled spread of disinformation. Although
   previous research has investigated the effects of misinformation and
   corrective efforts, we know too little about the role of visuals in
   disinformation and fact checking. Against this backdrop, we conducted an
   online experiment with a diverse sample of U.S. citizens (N = 1,404) to
   investigate the credibility of textual versus multimodal
   (text-plus-visual) disinformation, and the effects of textual and
   multimodal fact checkers in refuting disinformation on school shootings
   and refugees. Our findings indicate that, irrespective of the source,
   multimodal disinformation is considered slightly more credible than
   textual disinformation. Fact checkers can help to overcome the potential
   harmful consequences of disinformation. We also found that fact checkers
   can overcome partisan and attitudinal filters - which points to the
   relevance of fact checking as a journalistic discipline.},

Abstract = {Communication abundance in the digital sphere has raised concern over
   audience fragmentation and the declining capacity of general news media
   to shape common experiences and promote shared discourses required by a
   well-functioning local democracy. Based on the concept of mediated
   public connection this paper offers an analytical framework to
   investigate how people orient themselves to a local public world through
   media in high-choice, digitally advanced information environments. Two
   analytical dimensions of people's media use - practice and perception -
   are tested on survey data from Norway (N = 1692) using a network
   analysis approach combined with media experience data. The study finds
   substantial convergence in use of different online and offline media
   with the largest audience overlap occurring between online local and
   regional newspapers and Facebook. These digital players represent the
   backbone of the local media environment under study. Overall, citizens'
   experiences with different media as democratic resources for their local
   public life are not very strong and weaker for online media than for
   their offline editions.},

Abstract = {Spatially or temporally dense polling remains both difficult and
   expensive using existing survey methods. In response, there have been
   increasing efforts to approximate various survey measures using social
   media, but most of these approaches remain methodologically flawed. To
   remedy these flaws, this article combines 1,200 state-level polls during
   the 2012 presidential campaign with over 100 million state-located
   political tweets; models the polls as a function of the Twitter text
   using a new linear regularization feature-selection method; and shows
   via out-of-sample testing that when properly modeled, the Twitter-based
   measures track and to some degree predict opinion polls, and can be
   extended to unpolled states and potentially substate regions and subday
   timescales. An examination of the most predictive textual features
   reveals the topics and events associated with opinion shifts, sheds
   light on more general theories of partisan difference in attention and
   information processing, and may be of use for real-time campaign
   strategy.},

Title = {Platforms for Incivility: Examining Perceptions Across Different Media
   Formats},
Journal = {POLITICAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {35},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {97-116},
Abstract = {This article investigates how the mix of attributes present across
   different media shapes perceptions of incivility. I argue that certain
   modalities, particularly the channel and structure of a media platform,
   facilitate the perception of media as more uncivil even if the content
   is kept the same. To test this argument, I conduct two survey
   experiments in which participants are randomly assigned to treatments in
   which the substantive content and text remains the same but is packaged
   to mimic different media types. Generally, audio and video increase
   awareness of incivility cues as well as participants' evaluations of
   negative, emotional, and entertaining tone. There are also differences
   in the extent to which individuals notice incivility on Twitter than on
   other text-based media platforms. The social media platform is also
   particularly entertaining in comparison to the other platforms studied.
   This article demonstrates that media attributes interact to shape our
   understanding and identification of uncivil language. Furthermore, it
   suggests that more attention should be focused on identifying the
   different sets of characteristics that make incivility more or less
   likely or salient in political media.},

Journal = {DIGITAL JOURNALISM},

Volume = {7},

Abstract = {Search engines are among the most popular online services used in a
   range of contexts, including to find information on political issues. As
   such, they increasingly act as powerful mediators between news
   organizations and their audiences. The claim that search results are
   politically biased, while hardly new, has also recently received fresh
   support from President Donald Trump, who has blamed Google for unfairly
   prioritizing news outlets critical of his policies. In the context of
   elections, search engines may serve to inform citizens and have been
   argued to sway the choices of undecided voters. I examine two related
   issues: How political parties and candidates are represented in Google
   Search results and how strongly results in both Google Search and Google
   News are personalized in the run up to the 2017 German general
   elections. My results suggest that some parties and candidates are able
   to exert greater influence over how they are represented in search
   results than others, through a combination of local branch websites and
   social media presences. I furthermore find only a small share of results
   which differ from the mainstream, while controlling for time, language,
   and location, calling into question the validity of the filter bubble
   concept.},

Abstract = {Diversity is a crucial precondition for a democratic public discourse.
   In today's high-choice media environments, exposure to diverse news is
   largely determined by individuals' personal selection. Yet these
   decisions are increasingly shaped by online platforms, whose curation
   mechanisms may serve to expand or contract the diversity of encountered
   content. In a major extension of existing research, we show that
   positive short-term effects of platforms mask detrimental long-term
   effects. Drawing on a four-month tracking dataset and a comprehensive
   content analysis covering the online news consumption of over 10,000
   German citizens, we demonstrate that even though short-term usage of
   platforms uniformly increases exposure diversity, long-term reliance can
   lead to decreases. In addition, platforms vary in their influences: News
   aggregators are beneficial to exposure diversity, while Twitter and
   search engines have a limiting effect; Facebook offers no significant
   influence.},

Abstract = {This essay explores the language of social protest in two geographic and
   diasporic locations in the Caribbean (Puerto Rico and the Dominican
   Republic) with long and ongoing histories of colonialism and
   imperialism. We analyze social media and digital mobilizing to examine
   how, in the midst of social protest, linguistic and semiotic tools
   indexed historicity, contemporaneity, and futurity through relational
   strategies that are not just textual and discursive, but also
   historical, social, and political. Throughout this essay, we share
   examples of intertextual and interdiscursive strategies that marked
   particular moments of protest as articulations of historical precedents,
   imperial and colonial presents, and alternative futures. These examples
   reveal how collective identities (i.e. el pueblo) are mobilized in
   social protest to generate counternarratives that address structures and
   systems rather than locate social critiques in particular individuals
   and political parties. In shedding light on the intra-Caribbean
   solidarities that emerge over time, this analysis also points to a need
   to examine the erasures (Gal and Irvine 2019) performed through claims
   to unity and collective organizing.},

Abstract = {Estimation of ideological positions among voters, legislators, and other
   actors is central to many subfields of political science. Recent
   applications include large data sets of various types including roll
   calls, surveys, and textual and social media data. To overcome the
   resulting computational challenges, we propose fast estimation methods
   for ideal points with massive data. We derive the
   expectation-maximization (EM) algorithms to estimate the standard ideal
   point model with binary, ordinal, and continuous outcome variables. We
   then extend this methodology to dynamic and hierarchical ideal point
   models by developing variational EM algorithms for approximate
   inference. We demonstrate the computational efficiency and scalability
   of our methodology through a variety of real and simulated data. In
   cases where a standard Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm would require
   several days to compute ideal points, the proposed algorithm can produce
   essentially identical estimates within minutes. Open-source software is
   available for implementing the proposed methods.},

Title = {FINISHING THE ``UNFINISHED{''} STORY Online newspaper discussion threads
   as journalistic texts},
Journal = {DIGITAL JOURNALISM},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {5},
Number = {2},
Pages = {213-232},
Abstract = {Discussion threads published beneath articles on news websites have only
   lately become the subject of serious scholarship. While early research
   preoccupied itself with the hostile nature of comments posted on such
   forums, and the issue of moderation, recent studies have focused on two
   interlocking questions: the extent to which professional news
   organizations, and the journalists they employ, are ``buying into{''}
   the value of encouraging audience-members to comment on their articles
   and how successfully (or not) news-makers are using threads to forge
   virtual `` communities{''}. While the purpose of constructing such
   communities has largely been viewed through a utilitarian prism-as a
   means of drawing in traffic, building brand loyalty and generating
   income-consideration has also been given to threads as vehicles for
   empowering citizens, by allowing them to debate and/or contest the
   authority of professionally written news texts and/or establishment
   narratives. This article aims to go further, by building on an emerging
   strand of research which conceives of discussion posts less as adjuncts,
   or mere responses, to journalists' articles than extensions of them. It
   argues that the most valuable ``evidence-based{''} posts add background
   detail, colour and context that can greatly enhance- and help make
   complete-otherwise ``unfinished{''} stories.},

Abstract = {Historical classifications of journalistic traditions are the backbone
   of comparative explanations for political news coverage. This study
   assesses the validity of the dominant media systems framework and
   proposes and tests a novel framework, which states that a history of
   authoritarianism affects today's coverage. To facilitate a clean
   cross-national comparison, we focus on the same person and measurement
   in 12 Western democracies, that is, the use of the pejorative terms
   ``sexist,{''} ``racist,{''} ``dictator,{''} and equivalents to describe
   Donald Trump. Our manually validated automated content analysis
   (2016-2018; N = 27,830) shows that content varies along with countries'
   media and authoritarian history: pejoration is more common in countries
   with a polarized pluralist media system and former authoritarian
   countries than elsewhere. Newspapers' ideology does not matter,
   irrespective of countries' level of political parallelism or experiences
   with authoritarianism. Combined, we provide new methodological and
   theoretical handles to further comparative communication research in
   Western democracies.},

Journal = {DIGITAL JOURNALISM},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Number = {6},
Pages = {694-714},
Month = {JUL 3},
Abstract = {Push notifications provide news outlets with direct access to audiences
   amid concerns around information overload, disinformation, and
   heightened competition for reader attention. Such news distribution is
   relevant because it (a) bypasses social media and news aggregators,
   reaching readers directly; (b) alters the agency and control of temporal
   news personalisation; and (c) reinforces mobile as the locus of contact
   between news organisations and audiences. However, push notifications
   are a relatively under-researched topic. We explore news organisations'
   use of alerts, considering whether they attempt to integrate with
   existing mobile-user behaviour patterns or seek to be a disruptive
   element, garnering attention when audiences are not typically using
   devices. Through quantitative content analysis, this study examines the
   temporality of push notifications (n = 7092) from nine Northwestern
   European countries, comprising 34 news outlets. These data allow for
   comparisons at two levels: publisher type and national context. The
   study shows how the temporal patterns of push notifications'
   dissemination align with existing news consumption behaviours; concepts
   of content-snacking and audiences' rhythms and rituals are a useful lens
   through which these immediate, concise texts can be considered. Our
   findings show that news organisations use the mobile channel for
   attracting and maintaining users' attention, with varying
   interpretations of temporal customisability.},

Abstract = {While interest in esports is widespread across demographic categories,
   the gendered norms surrounding video game play have been replicated,
   resulting in a male-dominated space. Scholars argue that broadening
   representations of gamers is necessary to normalizing women's presence
   in esports. As nongaming organizations enter the space, they have a
   unique opportunity to disrupt established norms through their
   representations of esports competitors. This study analyzes the
   representation of U.S. Army Esports (USAE) team members via official
   social media channels. USAE was created as a public relations tool to
   engage with a younger audience, redefine the public image of the Army,
   and recruit soldiers. Using a critical public relations framework and
   critical discourse analysis, we examine the discourse around gender and
   esports constructed through USAE's representation of team members and
   the role of public relations practice in reinforcing or disrupting
   existing norms.},

Abstract = {The huge collections of news content which have become available through

   challenging journalism scholars to analyse unprecedented amounts of

   tool to face this challenge. LDA is a cutting edge technique for content
   analysis, designed to automatically organize large archives of documents
   based on latent topics, measured as patterns of word (co-) occurrence.
   We explain how this technique works, how different choices by the
   researcher affect the results and how the results can be meaningfully
   interpreted. To demonstrate its usefulness for journalism research, we
   conducted a case study of the New York Times coverage of nuclear
   technology from 1945 to the present, partially replicating a study by
   Gamson and Modigliani. This shows that LDA is a useful tool for
   analysing trends and patterns in news content in large digital news
   archives relatively quickly.},

Title = {Breaking Through the Ambivalence: Journalistic Responses to Information
   Security Technologies},
Journal = {DIGITAL JOURNALISM},
Abstract = {Over the last several years, numerous journalists and news organizations
   have reported incidents in which their communications have been hacked,
   intercepted, or retrieved. In 2014, Google security experts found that
   21 of the world's 25 most popular media outlets were targets of
   state-sponsored hacking attempts, and many journalists have watched
   helplessly as hackers took control of their social media accounts,
   targeting confidential information in their internal servers. When
   journalists' digital accounts are vulnerable to hacks or surveillance,
   news organizations, journalists, and their sources are at risk, and
   journalists' ability to carry out their news making function is reduced.
   Yet, some journalists do not believe that hacking and surveillance are
   significant threats, and they are not adopting information security
   measures to protect their data, themselves, or their sources. This
   research study includes 19 interviews with journalists, developers, and
   digital security trainers to shed light on journalists' perceptions of
   information security technologies, including motivations to adopt and
   barriers to adoption. The findings show that motivations to adopt
   information security technologies hinge on the idea of protection:
   protection of self, story, and the journalist's role-more so than the
   protection of the source, contrary to contemporary discourse about why
   journalists need to adopt such technologies.},

Abstract = {The goal of this paper is to evaluate two methods for the topic modeling
   of multilingual document collections: (1) machine translation (MT), and
   (2) the coding of semantic concepts using a multilingual dictionary (MD)
   prior to topic modeling. We empirically assess the consequences of these
   approaches based on both a quantitative comparison of models and a
   qualitative validation of each method's potentials and weaknesses. Our
   case study uses two text collections (of tweets and news articles) in
   three languages (English, Hebrew, Arabic), covering the ongoing local
   conflicts between Israeli authorities, settlers, and Palestinian
   Bedouins in the West Bank. We find that both methods produce a large
   share of equivalent topics, especially in the context of fairly
   homogenous news discourse, yet show limited but systematic differences
   when applied to highly heterogenous social media discourse. While the MD
   model delivers a more nuanced picture of conflict-related topics, it
   misses several more peripheral topics, especially those unrelated to the
   dictionary's focus, which are picked up by the MT model. Our study is a
   first step toward instrument validation, indicating that both methods
   yield valid, comparable results, while method-specific differences
   remain.},

Title = {Twitter in the News: An Analysis of Embedded Tweets in Political News
   Coverage},
Journal = {DIGITAL JOURNALISM},
Abstract = {This study examines the growing journalistic practice of embedding full
   tweets in online political news coverage. Against the background of a
   hybrid media system, we pursue three research goals. First, we evaluate
   the scope of the Twitter-in-the-news phenomenon relative to news
   coverage as a whole. Second, we examine the functions of embedded
   tweets. Third, we identify characteristics that increase the likelihood
   that tweets will be selected for publication in a news article. We
   combine computational methods with a manual content analysis and analyze
   political news coverage of one month outside election periods in four
   German online news outlets. Our results show that embedding tweets in
   the news is not a niche phenomenon but has been established as a routine
   journalistic practice to a moderate extent. In the majority of news
   articles, the function of tweets is to illustrate an argument or
   information provided in the text. Geographical proximity and - with some
   dependencies - the number of popularity cues increased the likelihood of
   a tweet to be picked up for reporting. The paper shows how
   transformation processes currently observed in journalism manifest
   themselves in reporting.},

   New news genres},
Journal = {DIGITAL JOURNALISM},

Volume = {5},

Pages = {986-1005},
Abstract = {Based on research carried out over two years amongst groups of students
   from the United Kingdom, France, United States and Russia, this article
   explores how churnalism is not only having an impact on what people read
   but also on how they read it, with far-reaching consequences for what
   has traditionally been perceived as the news genre. Drawing on genre as
   a social action, we explore the ways in which churnalism is changing
   news consumption. New news genres are appearing in response to new
   social interactions that users repeatedly act out predominantly online.
   As users, we produce and consume texts which we refer to as ``news{''}
   in multiple situations which can be sorted into patterns. Our
   comparative analysis offers surprising insights into how these patterns
   form new news genres, characteristic of social media (many-to-many)
   instead of mass media (one-to-many). Genres should be studied not only
   through textual analysis but also through the prism of social reality
   and recurrent social actions, particularly now that users, rather than
   journalists, are taking a dominant role in identifying what constitutes
   news genres. Our perception of what defines news is determined by the
   changing ways in which we consume news.},

Journal = {POLITICAL ANALYSIS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {28},
Number = {1},
Pages = {87-111},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Word vectorization is an emerging text-as-data method that shows great
   promise for automating the analysis of semantics-here, the cultural
   meanings of words-in large volumes of text. Yet successes with this
   method have largely been confined to massive corpora where the meanings
   of words are presumed to be fixed. In political science applications,
   however, many corpora are comparatively small and many interesting
   questions hinge on the recognition that meaning changes over time.
   Together, these two facts raise vexing methodological challenges. Can
   word vectors trace the changing cultural meanings of words in typical
   small corpora use cases? I test four time-sensitive implementations of
   word vectors (word2vec) against a gold standard developed from a modest
   data set of 161 years of newspaper coverage. I find that one
   implementation method clearly outperforms the others in matching human
   assessments of how public dialogues around equality in America have
   changed over time. In addition, I suggest best practices for using
   word2vec to study small corpora for time series questions, including
   bootstrap resampling of documents and pretraining of vectors. I close by
   showing that word2vec allows granular analysis of the changing meaning
   of words, an advance over other common text-as-data methods for semantic
   research questions.},

Title = {Right-Wing, Populist, Controlled by Foreign Powers? Topic
   Diversification and Partisanship in the Content Structures of
   German-Language Alternative Media},
Journal = {DIGITAL JOURNALISM},
Abstract = {This study investigates the overall topic compositions and traces of
   right-wing populist partisanship in the content structures of
   German-language digital alternative news outlets. We argue that a
   topically heterogeneous landscape of right-wing populist alternative
   news outlets could maximize the reach of right-wing populist messages.
   Using LDA topic modeling, we explore the topical structures of nine
   different outlets (n = 66,965 articles) and empirically identify
   meaningful groups of outlets. Our analyses suggest the existence of two
   topically heterogeneous clusters of alternative news media: (1) core
   right-wing populist outlets, with around 45-50\% of articles coming from
   topics that are related to right-wing or populist politics; and (2)
   topically diverse outlets. The latter group's topic selection also
   reveals right-wing populist partisanship, but less prominently so, while
   putting more emphasis on general interest news topics, such as sports,
   economy, or international relations. This group also includes Russian
   state-owned RT deutsch and Falun Gong-affiliated Epoch Times whose
   institutional roots, however, are only partially reflected in their
   topic selection. Additionally, longitudinal analyses reveal an increase
   of populism-related topics in both groups around the election date of
   the 2017 German federal election.},

Title = {VISUALIZATION, TECHNOLOGIES, OR THE PUBLIC? Exploring the articulation
   of data-driven journalism in the Twittersphere},
Journal = {DIGITAL JOURNALISM},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {6},
Number = {6},
Pages = {737-758},
Abstract = {Data(-driven) journalism has triggered debates about whether this
   innovative storytelling and investigative approach, using data
   analytical and computational methods, better serves the public. Applying
   the concept of articulation, wherein an array of terms are juxtaposed
   and expressed together, this paper examines how the term ``data-driven
   journalism{''} is represented on social media. Focusing on the
   Twittersphere as the research context, the paper employed the Twitter
   search application programming interface (API) to harvest all available
   public tweets (N = 6951) containing hashtags or keywords related to
   data-driven journalism within a four-week period in late 2016. A
   text-mining analysis of the contents of these tweets found that they
   focused extensively on journalistic practices, data visualization, and
   data analytical techniques. Further analysis on the hashtag
   co-occurrence network revealed that a number of hashtags bridged and
   organized the discussion of data-driven journalism in the Twittersphere.
   Some hashtags on technologies and commercial applications, such as
   ``\#dataviz,{''} ``\#bigdata,{''} and ``\#datajournalism,{''} were
   located at important positions in the network. In contrast,
   public-related terms, such as ``\#opendata{''} or
   ``\#opengovernment,{''} were mentioned in a limited way and positioned
   peripherally. Implications for journalism and society are discussed.},

Title = {An Emotional Rally: Exploring Commenters' Responses to Online News
   Coverage of the COVID-19 Crisis in Austria},
Journal = {DIGITAL JOURNALISM},
Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic presents an unparalleled global crisis impacting
   both public and private life. In the situation of uncertainty, emotions
   run high and might compromise the public acceptance of and compliance
   with countermeasures tackling the crisis. Mass media play an integral
   part in communicating crisis measures and provide an institutionalised
   channel to diffuse relevant information to a broad audience. This is
   especially true for digital outlets of legacy media given the greater
   immediacy of coverage. In addition, digital news offers the unique
   opportunity for readers to engage with the news contents, allowing an
   analysis of the dynamics of emotional reactions to crisis news coverage.
   We explore the case of Austria as an early COVID-19 hotspot. We analyse
   digital news coverage of two high-circulation newspapers and the
   emotionality it prompted in user comments, based on a unique dataset
   comprising 38,253 articles and around 1.6 Million comments from 1
   January 2020 to 30 June 2020. Results show increased emotionality during
   lockdown and towards the government. With reference to the rally
   around-the-flag literature, we interpret this as emotional rallying
   behind the responsible political crisis managers.},

Journal = {POLITICAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {38},
Number = {4},
Pages = {388-406},
Month = {JUL 4},
Abstract = {Women politicians have long faced a gendered media environment, where
   their novelty, potential (in)competence, family, and appearance have
   been over-emphasized in comparison to men. Much of this literature has
   focused on politicians running for office and women who hold legislative
   office. Little research investigates gendered news media presentations
   of women as heads of government. While the literature predicts that
   women heads of government should experience gendered differences in news
   coverage, there is also good reason to expect that news about government
   operations should not vary based on the gender of the government leader.
   Using their first year of online news coverage (N = 11,675), we build a
   series of dictionaries and use automated content analysis to assess how
   frequently heads of government's uniqueness, gender, family, appearance,
   sexual orientation, character, and competence are presented. We also
   assess the tone of news about each head of government. Results show that
   gendered coverage exists for women heads of government in potentially
   surprising ways. Fewer new stories are written about them, on average,
   than men. Women's coverage features more feminine and masculine gendered
   identifies, as well as more coverage about their clothing. We find
   little evidence for increased personalization, and women's character and
   competence are presented more positively than men's. Though blunt, this
   analysis shows that news about heads of government remains gendered.},

Title = {POLITICAL NEWS IN ONLINE AND PRINT NEWSPAPERS Are online editions better
   by electoral democratic standards?},
Journal = {DIGITAL JOURNALISM},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {4},
Number = {6},
Pages = {723-742},
Abstract = {The electoral model of democracy holds the ideal of citizens who are
   well informed about politics, and regards it as a task of news media to
   provide citizens with political information. Against this ideal, the
   quality of political news in online news outlets is highly contested.
   While pessimists point out the dangers of increased competition online,
   optimists emphasize the potential benefits of unlimited space and
   interactivity. To see which view holds true, this paper compares
   political news in popular and elite print newspapers and their
   respective online editions during the 2013 National Election Campaign in
   Austria. Findings show that online editions score better than paper
   editions regarding the amount of political news, (party) diversity, and
   emotionalization, but differences between newspaper types were notable.
   Whereas elite newspapers cover politics online more extensively than in
   print, the reverse is true for popular newspapers. Leader focus is also
   strong in popular papers online. We conclude that the gap in quality
   between political news in elite and in popular newspapers is larger
   online. This might contribute to a wider gap between a well-informed
   elite audience and a lesser-informed popular news audience, when
   audiences switch from print to online news.},

Title = {The ``Arbiters of What Our Voters See{''}: Facebook and Google's
   Struggle with Policy, Process, and Enforcement around Political
   Advertising},
Journal = {POLITICAL COMMUNICATION},

Abstract = {The question of how Facebook and Google make and justify decisions
   regarding permissible political advertising on their platforms is
   increasingly important. In this paper, we focus on the U.S. case and
   present findings from interviews with 17 former social media firm
   employees (n = 7) and political practitioners (n = 11). We also analyze
   emails (n = 45) exchanged between Facebook government and elections
   staffers and two campaigns, a U.S. gubernatorial (2017) and presidential
   campaign (2016), regarding the platform's policies in the context of
   paid speech. In addressing questions about Facebook's and Google's
   processes and policies regarding paid political content, the rationales
   for them, and the ability of campaigns to contest decisions, this study
   shows how while Facebook and Google resist being arbiters of political
   discourse, they actively vet paid content on their platforms. These
   platforms differ with respect to how and what decisions they make in the
   context of paid speech and within each company there are active and
   ongoing debates among staffers about speech. These debates at times take
   place in consultation with political practitioners and often occur in
   the context of external events. Across these firms, policies regarding
   speech evolve through these internal debates, appeals by practitioners,
   and outside pressure. At the same time, both Facebook and Google make
   decisions in often opaque ways, according to policies that are not
   transparent, and without clear justifications to campaigns or the public
   as to how they are applied or enforced. This limits options for
   political practitioners to contest regulation decisions. Finally, we
   conclude by arguing for the need for expanded capacities for political
   practitioners and the public to exercise voice around the content
   decisions that these firms make, and for firms to create more robust
   institutional mechanisms for incorporating it.},

Title = {Multi-Label Prediction for Political Text-as-Data},
Journal = {POLITICAL ANALYSIS},
Abstract = {Political scientists increasingly use supervised machine learning to
   code multiple relevant labels from a single set of texts. The current
   ``best practice{''} of individually applying supervised machine learning
   to each label ignores information on inter-label association(s), and is
   likely to under-perform as a result. We introduce multi-label prediction
   as a solution to this problem. After reviewing the multi-label
   prediction framework, we apply it to code multiple features of (i)
   access to information requests made to the Mexican government and (ii)
   country-year human rights reports. We find that multi-label prediction
   outperforms standard supervised learning approaches, even in instances
   where the correlations among one's multiple labels are low.},

Abstract = {Delegation of powers represents a grant of authority by politicians to
   one or more agents whose powers are determined by the conditions in

   on labor-intensive content analysis that ultimately restricts our

   change in recent years. We present a machine learning approach to the
   empirical estimation of authority and constraint in European Union (EU)
   legislation, and demonstrate its ability to accurately generate the same
   discretionary measures used in an original study directly using all EU
   directives and regulations enacted between 1958-2017. We assess validity
   by training our classifier on a random sample of only 10\% of hand-coded
   provisions and replicating an important substantive finding. While our
   principal interest lies in delegation, our method is extensible to any
   context in which human coding has been profitably produced.},

Abstract = {With the availability of large volumes of electronic communications data
   and the increasing sophistication of computational techniques, the
   development of automated approaches for different kinds of framing
   analysis is an important goal of researchers. There is as yet no
   standard method for the ``unsupervised{''} inductive identification of
   frames based upon the content of articles. Three groups of core
   approaches underlie a wide range of work in this area, and we compare
   three techniques based on these approaches against each other and
   against manual human analysts. The three techniques are a k-means
   clustering algorithm together with a sophisticated natural language
   processing (NLP)-based feature selection process; evolutionary factor
   analysis (EFA), a factor analysis approach; and the structural topic
   model (STM). We use two datasets - one very focused and one extremely
   broad - as examples of the kind of frame analysis problems readers may
   wish to attempt. Even in a highly targeted dataset, we find some
   distance between the frames generated by computational analysis and
   those manually produced by our human analysts. The details of each
   method have a substantial impact on frame quality and interpretation. We
   find that the STM approach is the most effective for our narrow-scope
   dataset, but that it returns definite topics, and not frames, when
   working on our very broad dataset. We also show that we can get results
   emphasizing different parts of the framing problem by combining parts of
   different methods as a multi-stage process, rather than viewing
   available methods as simple plug-and-play models.},

Abstract = {We propose a five-step computational framing analysis framework that

   combines unsupervised and supervised machine learning and leverages a
   state-of-the-art multilingual deep learning model, which can
   significantly enhance frame prediction performance while requiring a
   considerably small sample of manual annotations. Most importantly,
   anyone can perform the proposed computational framing analysis using a
   free, open-sourced system, created by a team of communication scholars,
   computer scientists, web designers and web developers. Making advanced
   computational analysis available to researchers without a programming

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {In text, images, merged surveys, voter files, and elsewhere, data sets
   are often missing important covariates, either because they are latent
   features of observations (such as sentiment in text) or because they are
   not collected (such as race in voter files). One promising approach for
   coping with this missing data is to find the true values of the missing
   covariates for a subset of the observations and then train a machine
   learning algorithm to predict the values of those covariates for the
   rest. However, plugging in these predictions without regard for
   prediction error renders regression analyses biased, inconsistent, and
   overconfident. We characterize the severity of the problem posed by
   prediction error, describe a procedure to avoid these inconsistencies
   under comparatively general assumptions, and demonstrate the performance
   of our estimators through simulations and a study of hostile political
   dialogue on the Internet. We provide software implementing our approach.},

   method targets the analysis toward a well-defined ``retrospective

   a controlled fashion, on how to use a large identifying covariate set.

Abstract = {Supervised machine learning methods are increasingly employed in
   political science. Such models require costly manual labeling of
   documents. In this paper, we introduce active learning, a framework in
   which data to be labeled by human coders are not chosen at random but
   rather targeted in such a way that the required amount of data to train
   a machine learning model can be minimized. We study the benefits of
   active learning using text data examples. We perform simulation studies
   that illustrate conditions where active learning can reduce the cost of
   labeling text data. We perform these simulations on three corpora that
   vary in size, document length, and domain. We find that in cases where
   the document class of interest is not balanced, researchers can label a
   fraction of the documents one would need using random sampling (or
   ``passive{''} learning) to achieve equally performing classifiers. We
   further investigate how varying levels of intercoder reliability affect
   the active learning procedures and find that even with low reliability,
   active learning performs more efficiently than does random sampling.},

Abstract = {Machine learning is a field at the intersection of statistics and
   computer science that uses algorithms to extract information and
   knowledge from data. Its applications increasingly find their way into
   economics, political science, and sociology. We offer a brief
   introduction to this vast toolbox and illustrate its current uses in the
   social sciences, including distilling measures from new data sources,
   such as text and images; characterizing population heterogeneity;
   improving causal inference; and offering predictions to aid policy
   decisions and theory development. We argue that, in addition to serving
   similar purposes in sociology, machine learning tools can speak to
   long-standing questions on the limitations of the linear modeling
   framework, the criteria for evaluating empirical findings, transparency
   around the context of discovery, and the epistemological core of the
   discipline.},

Volume = {30},

Abstract = {We introduce a constrained priority mechanism that combines
   outcome-based matching from machine learning with preference-based
   allocation schemes common in market design. Using real-world data, we
   illustrate how our mechanism could be applied to the assignment of
   refugee families to host country locations, and kindergarteners to
   schools. Our mechanism allows a planner to first specify a threshold g
   for the minimum acceptable average outcome score that should be achieved
   by the assignment. In the refugee matching context, this score
   corresponds to the probability of employment, whereas in the student
   assignment context, it corresponds to standardized test scores. The
   mechanism is a priority mechanism that considers both outcomes and
   preferences by assigning agents (refugee families and students) based on
   their preferences, but subject to meeting the planner's specified
   threshold. The mechanism is both strategy-proof and constrained
   efficient in that it always generates a matching that is not Pareto
   dominated by any other matching that respects the planner's threshold.},

Title = {Toward an Aggregate, Implicit, and Dynamic Model of Norm Formation:
   Capturing Large-Scale Media Representations of Dynamic Descriptive Norms

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Media content can shape people's descriptive norm perceptions by
   presenting either population-level prevalence information or
   descriptions of individuals' behaviors. Supervised machine learning and
   crowdsourcing can be combined to answer new, theoretical questions about
   the ways in which normative perceptions form and evolve through
   repeated, incidental exposure to normative mentions emanating from the
   media environment. Applying these methods, this study describes tobacco
   and e-cigarette norm prevalence and trends over 37 months through an
   examination of a census of 135,764 long-form media texts, 12,262 popular
   YouTube videos, and 75,322,911 tweets. Long-form texts mentioned tobacco
   population norms (4-5\%) proportionately less often than e-cigarette
   population norms (20\%). Individual use norms were common across
   sources, particularly YouTube (tobacco long-form: 34\%; Twitter: 33\%;
   YouTube: 88\%; e-cigarette long form: 17\%; Twitter: 16\%; YouTube:
   96\%). The capacity to capture aggregated prevalence and temporal
   dynamics of normative media content permits asking population-level
   media effects questions that would otherwise be infeasible to address.},

Volume = {30},

Abstract = {One of the main challenges in comparative studies on populism concerns
   its temporal and spatial measurements within and between a large number
   of parties and countries. Textual analysis has proved useful for these
   purposes, and automated methods can further improve research in this
   direction. Here, we propose a method to derive a score of parties'
   levels of populism using supervised machine learning to perform textual
   analysis on national manifestos. We illustrate the advantages of our
   approach, which allows for measuring populism for a vast number of
   parties and countries without resource-intensive human-coding processes
   and provides accurate, updated information for temporal and spatial
   comparisons of populism. Furthermore, our method allows for obtaining a
   continuous score of populism, which ensures more fine-grained analyses
   of the party landscape while reducing the risk of arbitrary
   classifications. To illustrate the potential contribution of this score,
   we use it as a proxy for parties' levels of populism, analyzing average
   trends in six European countries from the early 2000s for nearly two
   decades.},

Journal = {POLITICAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {38},
Number = {1-2, SI},
Pages = {75-97},
Month = {MAR 15},
Abstract = {Politicians have strong incentives to use their communication to
   positively impress and persuade voters. Yet one important question that
   persists within the fields of political science, communication, and
   psychology is whether appearance or substance matters more during
   political campaigns. To a large extent, this appearance vs. substance
   question remains open and, crucially, the notion that appearance can in
   fact effectively sway voter perceptions is consequential for the health
   of democracy. This study leverages advances from the fields of machine
   learning and computer vision to expand our knowledge on how nonverbal
   elements of political communication influence voters immediate
   impressions of political actors. We rely on video from the 4th
   Republican Party presidential debate held on November 10, 2016, as well
   as continuous response approval data from a live focus group (n = 311;
   36,528 reactions), to determine how the emotional displays of political
   candidates influence voter impression formation. Our results suggest
   that anger displays can positively influence viewers' real-time
   evaluations. Happiness displays, on the other hand, are much less
   effective in eliciting a response from the viewing public, while fear
   displays were rarely projected by the candidates of the debate under
   study.},

Abstract = {I develop a procedure for estimating local-area public opinion called
   stacked regression and poststratification (SRP), a generalization of
   classical multilevel regression and poststratification (MRP). This
   procedure employs a diverse ensemble of predictive models-including
   multilevel regression, LASSO, k-nearest neighbors, random forest, and
   gradient boosting-to improve the cross-validated fit of the first-stage
   predictions. In a Monte Carlo simulation, SRP significantly outperforms
   MRP when there are deep interactions in the data generating process,
   without requiring the researcher to specify a complex parametric model
   in advance. In an empirical application, I show that SRP produces
   superior local public opinion estimates on a broad range of issue areas,
   particularly when trained on large datasets.},

Abstract = {Electoral forensics involves examining election results for anomalies to
   efficiently identify patterns indicative of electoral irregularities.
   However, there is disagreement about which, if any, forensics tool is
   most effective at identifying fraud, and there is no method for
   integrating multiple tools. Moreover, forensic efforts have failed to
   systematically take advantage of country-specific details that might aid
   in diagnosing fraud. We deploy a Bayesian additive regression trees
   (BART) model-a machine-learning technique-on a large cross-national data
   set to explore the dense network of potential relationships between
   various forensic indicators of anomalies and electoral fraud risk
   factors, on the one hand, and the likelihood of fraud, on the other.
   This approach allows us to arbitrate between the relative importance of
   different forensic and contextual features for identifying electoral
   fraud and results in a diagnostic tool that can be relatively easily
   implemented in cross-national research.},

Abstract = {When comparing media coverage or analysing which content people are
   exposed to, researchers need to abstract from individual articles. At
   the same time, aggregating them into broad topics or issues often is too
   coarse and loses nuance. Both theoretically and methodologically, the
   analysis of an appropriate intermediate level of aggregation is
   underdeveloped. This article advances research in various areas of
   journalism studies by developing a theoretical argument for introducing
   the ``news event{''} as a level of analysis. Based on this, we discuss
   several computational approaches to empirically detect such news events
   in large corpora of news coverage in an unsupervised manner. We provide
   two approaches: One based on traditional tf center dot idf based cosine
   similarities, and one that relies on word embeddings, in particular the
   softcosine measure. Both methods, combined with a network clustering
   algorithm, perform very well in detecting news events. We apply this
   method in a case study of 45k news articles from different outlets, in
   which we show that different news outlets have distinct profiles in the
   events they cover.},

Journal = {POLITICAL ANALYSIS},
Abstract = {The link between objective facts and politically relevant beliefs is an
   essential mechanism for democratic accountability. Yet the bulk of
   empirical work on this topic measures objective facts at whatever
   geographic units are readily available. We investigate the implications
   of these largely arbitrary choices for predicting individual-level
   opinions. We show that varying the geographic resolution-namely
   aggregating economic data to different geographic units-influences the
   strength of the relationship between economic evaluations and local
   economic conditions. Finding that unemployment claims are the best
   predictor of economic evaluations, especially when aggregated at the
   commuting zone or media market level, we underscore the importance of
   the modifiable areal unit problem. Our methods provide an example of how
   applied scholars might investigate the importance of geography in their

Abstract = {This article provides a new methodology to predict armed conflict by
   using newspaper text. Through machine learning, vast quantities of
   newspaper text are reduced to interpretable topics. These topics are
   then used in panel regressions to predict the onset of conflict. We
   propose the use of the within-country variation of these topics to
   predict the timing of conflict. This allows us to avoid the tendency of
   predicting conflict only in countries where it occurred before. We show
   that the within-country variation of topics is a good predictor of
   conflict and becomes particularly useful when risk in previously
   peaceful countries arises. Two aspects seem to be responsible for these
   features. Topics provide depth because they consist of changing, long
   lists of terms that make them able to capture the changing context of
   conflict. At the same time, topics provide width because they are
   summaries of the full text, including stabilizing factors.},

Title = {Estimating Heterogeneous Treatment Effects and the Effects of

Journal = {POLITICAL ANALYSIS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {25},
Number = {4},
Pages = {413-434},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Randomized experiments are increasingly used to study political
   phenomena because they can credibly estimate the average effect of a
   treatment on a population of interest. But political scientists are
   often interested in how effects vary across subpopulations-heterogeneous
   treatment effects-and how differences in the content of the treatment
   affects responses-the response to heterogeneous treatments. Several new
   methods have been introduced to estimate heterogeneous effects, but it
   is difficult to know if a method will perform well for a particular data
   set. Rather than using only one method, we show how an ensemble of
   methods-weighted averages of estimates from individual models
   increasingly used in machine learning-accurately measure heterogeneous
   effects. Building on a large literature on ensemble methods, we show how
   the weighting of methods can contribute to accurate estimation of
   heterogeneous treatment effects and demonstrate how pooling models lead
   to superior performance to individual methods across diverse problems.
   We apply the ensemble method to two experiments, illuminating how the
   ensemble method for heterogeneous treatment effects facilitates
   exploratory analysis of treatment effects.},

Journal = {ANNUAL REVIEW OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {25},
Pages = {419-441},
Abstract = {Social scientists commonly use computational models to estimate proxies
   of unobserved concepts, then incorporate these proxies into subsequent
   tests of their theories. The consequences of this practice, which occurs
   in over two-thirds of recent computational work in political science,
   are underappreciated. Imperfect proxies can reflect noise and
   contamination from other concepts, producing biased point estimates and
   standard errors. We demonstrate how analysts can use causal diagrams to
   articulate theoretical concepts and their relationships to estimated
   proxies, then apply straightforward rules to assess which conclusions
   are rigorously supportable. We formalize and extend common heuristics
   for ``signing the bias{''}-a technique for reasoning about unobserved
   confounding-to scenarios with imperfect proxies. Using these tools, we
   demonstrate how, in often-encountered research settings, proxy-based
   analyses allow for valid tests for the existence and direction of
   theorized effects. We conclude with best-practice recommendations for
   the rapidly growing literature using learned proxies to test causal
   theories.},

Abstract = {Principled methods for analyzing missing values, based chiefly on
   multiple imputation, have become increasingly popular yet can struggle
   to handle the kinds of large and complex data that are also becoming
   common. We propose an accurate, fast, and scalable approach to multiple
   imputation, which we call MIDAS (Multiple Imputation with Denoising
   Autoencoders). MIDAS employs a class of unsupervised neural networks
   known as denoising autoencoders, which are designed to reduce
   dimensionality by corrupting and attempting to reconstruct a subset of
   data. We repurpose denoising autoencoders for multiple imputation by
   treating missing values as an additional portion of corrupted data and
   drawing imputations from a model trained to minimize the reconstruction
   error on the originally observed portion. Systematic tests on simulated
   as well as real social science data, together with an applied example
   involving a large-scale electoral survey, illustrate MIDAS's accuracy
   and efficiency across a range of settings. We provide open-source
   software for implementing MIDAS.},

   we measure the importance of a number of theoretically motivated textual
   features to headline performance. Using a corpus of hundreds of
   thousands of headline A/B tests run by hundreds of news publishers, we
   develop and evaluate a machine-learned model to predict headline testing
   outcomes. We find that the model exhibits modest performance above
   baseline and further estimate an empirical upper bound for such
   content-based prediction in this domain, indicating an important role
   for non-content-based factors in test outcomes. Together, these results
   suggest that any particular headline writing approach has only a
   marginal impact, and that understanding reader behavior and headline
   context are key to predicting news attention decisions.},

Abstract = {Many have envisioned the use of AI methods to find hidden patterns of
   public interest in large volumes of data, greatly reducing the cost of
   investigative journalism. But so far only a few investigative stories
   have utilized AI methods, in relatively narrow ways. This paper surveys
   what has been accomplished in investigative reporting using AI
   techniques, why it has been difficult to apply more advanced methods,
   and what sorts of investigative journalism problems might be solved by
   AI in the near term. Journalism problems are often unique to a
   particular story, which means that training data is not readily
   available and the cost of complex models cannot be amortized over
   multiple projects. Much of the data relevant to a story is not publicly
   accessible but in the hands of governments and private entities, often
   requiring collection, negotiation, or purchase. Journalistic inference
   requires very high accuracy, or extensive manual checking, to avoid the
   risk of libel. The factors that make some set of facts ``newsworthy{''}
   are deeply sociopolitical and therefore difficult to encode
   computationally. The biggest near-term potential for AI in investigative
   journalism lies in data preparation tasks, such as data extraction from
   diverse documents and probabilistic cross-database record linkage.},

   Constructional Priming in Mandarin and American English Interaction},
Journal = {APPLIED LINGUISTICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {43},
Number = {1},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {In Dialogic syntax (cf. Du Bois 2014; Tantucci et al. 2018),
   naturalistic interaction is inherently grounded in resonance, viz. the
   catalytic activation of affinities across turns (Du Bois and Giora
   2014). Resonance occurs dynamically when interlocutors creatively
   coconstruct utterances that are formally and phonetically similar to the
   utterance of a prior speaker. In this study, we argue that such
   similarity can inform the machine learning prediction of linguistic and
   crosscultural diversity. We compared two sets of 1,000 exchanges
   involving (dis)agreement from the two balanced Callhome corpora of
   naturalistic interaction in Mandarin Chinese and American English. We
   found a correlation of overt use of pragmatic markers with resonance,
   indicating that priming does not occur as an exclusively implicit
   mechanism (as it is commonly held in the experimental literature e.g.
   Bock 1986; Bock et al. 2007), but naturalistically underpins dialogic
   engagement and cooperation among interactants. We fitted a mixed effects
   linear regression and a hierarchical clustering model to show that
   resonance occurs formally and functionally in different ways from one
   language to another. The applied results of this study can lead to a
   novel turn in AI research of conversational interfaces (McTear et al.
   2016; Klopfenstein et al. 2017), as they reveal the fundamental role
   played cross-linguistically by resonance as a form of engagement of
   human-to-human interaction and the importance to address this mechanism
   in machine-to-human communication.},

Abstract = {Existing approaches to measuring political disagreement from text data

   viable approach for estimating legislator-specific scores from the
   entire speech corpus of a legislature, while also producing extensive
   information about the evolution of speech polarization and politically
   loaded language. In the Irish Dail, we show that the dominant dimension
   of speech variation is government-opposition, with ministers more
   extreme on this dimension than backbenchers, and a second dimension
   distinguishing between the establishment and anti-establishment
   opposition parties. In the U.S. Senate, we estimate a dimension that has
   moderate within-party correlations with scales based on roll-call votes
   and campaign donation patterns; however, we observe greater overlap
   across parties in speech positions than roll-call positions and partisan
   polarization in speeches varies more clearly in response to major
   political events.},

Abstract = {Research has shown that emotions matter in politics, but we know less
   about when and why politicians use emotive rhetoric in the legislative
   arena. This article argues that emotive rhetoric is one of the tools
   politicians can use strategically to appeal to voters. Consequently, we
   expect that legislators are more likely to use emotive rhetoric in
   debates that have a large general audience. Our analysis covers two
   million parliamentary speeches held in the UK House of Commons and the
   Irish Parliament. We use a dictionary-based method to measure emotive
   rhetoric, combining the Affective Norms for English Words dictionary
   with word-embedding techniques to create a domain-specific dictionary.
   We show that emotive rhetoric is more pronounced in high-profile
   legislative debates, such as Prime Minister's Questions. These findings
   contribute to the study of legislative speech and political
   representation by suggesting that emotive rhetoric is used by
   legislators to appeal directly to voters.},

Year = {2022},
Volume = {43},

Abstract = {Recent studies found linguistic positivity bias in academic writing,
   that is, researchers tend to present their works with more positive
   words than negative ones. The present study aims to examine the issue
   from a diachronic perspective, and it is probably the first one that
   employed a mixed method of both a small lexicon analysis and sentiment
   analysis in this line of research. Specifically, a series of experiments
   were performed based on a corpus of 775,460 abstracts published between
   1969 and 2019 in 123 scientific journals covering 12 research
   disciplines in life sciences. The results demonstrated a linguistic
   positivity bias in academic writing. More importantly, a significant
   upward trend of linguistic positivity bias was observed over the past 5
   decades. Major communicative functions of positive and negative
   sentences are also analysed. Reasons for this linguistic positivity bias
   are explored from the perspectives of publication pressure/bias,
   employment of linguistic devices to promote research, and language use
   for political correctness purposes. Lastly, implications for authors and
   learners of academic writing and for researchers of sentiment analysis
   are also discussed.},

Volume = {37},
Number = {5},

Month = {SEP 2},
Abstract = {Previous studies conclude that governments fulfill a large share of
   their campaign pledges. However, only a minority of voters believe that
   politicians try to keep their promises, and many voters struggle to
   recall the fulfillment or breaking of salient campaign pledges
   accurately. I argue that this disparity between the public perception
   and empirical evidence is influenced by the information voters receive
   throughout the electoral cycle. I expect that the media extensively
   inform readers about political promises. In addition, I posit that news
   outlets focus more on broken than on fulfilled promises and that the
   focus on broken promises has increased over time. I find strong support
   for these expectations based on a new text corpus of over 430,000
   statements on political commitments published between 1979 and 2017 in
   22 newspapers during 33 electoral cycles in Australia, Canada, Ireland,
   and the United Kingdom. Newspapers inform voters regularly about
   announced, broken, and fulfilled promises. Yet, across the four
   countries, newspapers report at least twice as much on broken than on
   fulfilled promises. Moreover, this negativity bias in reports on
   political promises has increased substantively. The results have
   implications for studying campaign promises, negative information in
   mass media, and the linkages between voters and parties.},

Journal = {DIGITAL JOURNALISM},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},

Month = {JUN 14},
Abstract = {Given the centrality of news media to democracy, it is concerning that
   public trust in media has declined in many countries. A potential
   mechanism that may reverse this trend is independent fact-checking to
   adjudicate competing claims in news stories. We undertake a survey
   experiment on a sample of 1608 Australians to test the effects of
   fact-checking on media trust using a real-life case study known as the
   ``sports rorts{''} affair. We construct duplicate news articles from two
   national media outlets (i.e. ABC.net.au , news.com.au ) containing a
   senior government minister's real-life false claim that public funds
   were not used for political advantage immediately before an election.
   Half of the participants are exposed to a third-party fact check, which
   confirms the Minister's claim is verifiably false, the other half are
   not. All respondents are asked to evaluate the story's and news outlets'
   trustworthiness. Contrary to our expectations we find a backfire effect
   whereby independent fact-checking decreases readers' trust in the
   original news story and outlet. This negative relationship is not
   conditional on partisanship or the media source. Our study provides a
   cautionary tale for those expecting third-party fact-checks to increase
   media trust and we outline several avenues by which fact-checkers might
   overcome this.},

Abstract = {Voters evaluate politicians not just by what they say, but also how they
   say it, via facial displays of emotions and vocal pitch. Candidate
   characteristics can shape how leaders use-and how voters react to
   -nonverbal cues. Drawing on role congruity expectations, we study how
   the use of and reactions to facial, vocal, and textual communication in
   political debates varies by candidate gender. Relying on full-length
   videos of four German federal election debates (2005-2017) and a minor
   party debate, we use video, audio, and text data to measure candidate
   facial displays of emotion, vocal pitch, and speech sentiment.
   Consistent with our expectations, Angela Merkel expresses less anger
   than her male opponents, but she is just as emotive in other respects.
   Combining these measures of emotional expression with continuous
   responses recorded by live audiences, we find that voters punish Merkel
   for anger displays and reward her happiness and general emotional

Title = {Cross-Domain Topic Classification for Political Texts},
Journal = {POLITICAL ANALYSIS},
Abstract = {We introduce and assess the use of supervised learning in cross-domain
   topic classification. In this approach, an algorithm learns to classify
   topics in a labeled source corpus and then extrapolates topics in an
   unlabeled target corpus from another domain. The ability to use existing
   training data makes this method significantly more efficient than
   within-domain supervised learning. It also has three advantages over
   unsupervised topic models: the method can be more specifically targeted
   to a research question and the resulting topics are easier to validate
   and interpret. We demonstrate the method using the case of labeled party
   platforms (source corpus) and unlabeled parliamentary speeches (target
   corpus). In addition to the standard within-domain error metrics, we
   further validate the cross-domain performance by labeling a subset of
   target-corpus documents. We find that the classifier accurately assigns
   topics in the parliamentary speeches, although accuracy varies
   substantially by topic. We also propose tools diagnosing cross-domain
   classification. To illustrate the usefulness of the method, we present
   two case studies on how electoral rules and the gender of
   parliamentarians influence the choice of speech topics.},

Title = {The Automatic Analysis of Emotion in Political Speech Based on

Year = {2022},
Volume = {39},

Abstract = {Automatic sentiment analysis is used extensively in political science.
   The digitization of legislative transcripts has increased the potential
   application of established tools for the automated analyses of emotion
   in text. Unlike in writing, however, expressing emotion in speech
   involves intonation, facial expressions, and body lan- guage. Drawing on
   a new dataset of annotated texts and videos from the Canadian House of
   Commons, this paper does three things. First, we examine whether
   transcripts capture the emotional content of speeches. We find that
   transcripts capture sentiment, but not emotional arousal. Second, we
   compare strategies for the automated analysis of sentiment in text. We
   find that leading approaches performed reasonably well, but sentiment
   dictionaries generated using word embeddings surpassed these other
   approaches. Finally, we test the robustness of the approach based on
   word embeddings. Although the methodology is reasonably robust to
   alternative specifications, we find that dictionaries created using word
   embeddings are sensitive to the choice of seed words and to training
   corpus size. We conclude by discussing the implications for analyses of
   political speech.},

Journal = {COMMUNICATION METHODS AND MEASURES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {15},
Number = {2},
Pages = {81-102},
Month = {APR 3},
Abstract = {Many social scientists recognize that quantitative text analysis is a
   useful research methodology, but its application is still concentrated
   in documents written in European languages, especially English, and few
   sub-fields of political science, such as comparative politics and
   legislative studies. This seems to be due to the absence of flexible and
   cost-efficient methods that can be used to analyze documents in
   different domains and languages. Aiming to solve this problem, this
   paper proposes a semisupervised document scaling technique, called
   Latent Semantic Scaling (LSS), which can locate documents on various
   pre-defined dimensions. LSS achieves this by combining user-provided
   seed words and latent semantic analysis (word embedding). The article
   demonstrates its flexibility and efficiency in large-scale sentiment
   analysis of New York Times articles on the economy and Asahi Shimbun
   articles on politics. These examples show that LSS can produce results
   comparable to that of the Lexicoder Sentiment Dictionary (LSD) in both
   English and Japanese with only small sets of sentiment seed words. A new
   heuristic method that assists LSS users to choose a near-optimal number
   of singular values to obtain word vectors that best capture differences
   between documents on target dimensions is also presented.},

Title = {Biased Representation of Politicians in Google and Wikipedia Search? The
   Joint Effect of Party Identity, Gender Identity and Elections},
Journal = {POLITICAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {38},
Number = {4},
Pages = {447-478},
Month = {JUL 4},
Abstract = {Web search engines have become an important and trusted source when
   people seek political information. Even though previous research
   suggests that information about politicians in traditional and new media
   can provide content that makes stereotypes based on gender and party,
   little is known about the presence of such bias in search engines, which
   function as information gatekeepers in the digital age. Using
   quantitative text analysis and human coding techniques on a novel data
   set of members of the German parliament, this study examines whether
   search engine suggestions, i.e. search predictions, for politicians
   differ with respect to personal and role-oriented information based on
   the gender and party of the politician. It also explores whether the
   search engine representation of politicians changes around elections.
   The study further compares gender and party differences in search engine
   results with corresponding Wikipedia articles of the same politicians,
   as users are most often redirected to Wikipedia from Google. The results
   suggest that politicians' representation in search engines and Wikipedia
   are structured by a joint effect of their gender and party identity.
   While Google suggestions provide less personal information about female
   politicians belonging to a right-wing party compared to their male
   counterparts, this relationship is not observable for left-wing parties.
   Moreover, there are changes in gender biases around the election. In
   Wikipedia articles, politicians belonging to right-wing parties are
   represented with more personal information compared to politicians
   belonging to left ones, an effect which is even stronger for females.},

Abstract = {Word embeddings, the coefficients from neural network models predicting
   the use of words in context, have now become inescapable in applications
   involving natural language processing. Despite a few studies in
   political science, the potential of this methodology for the analysis of
   political texts has yet to be fully uncovered. This paper introduces
   models of word embeddings augmented with political metadata and trained
   on large-scale parliamentary corpora from Britain, Canada, and the
   United States. We fit these models with indicator variables of the party
   affiliation of members of parliament, which we refer to as party
   embeddings. We illustrate how these embeddings can be used to produce
   scaling estimates of ideological placement and other quantities of
   interest for political research. To validate the methodology, we assess
   our results against indicators from the Comparative Manifestos Project,
   surveys of experts, and measures based on roll-call votes. Our findings
   suggest that party embeddings are successful at capturing latent
   concepts such as ideology, and the approach provides researchers with an
   integrated framework for studying political language.},

Volume = {37},

Abstract = {Government perpetrated attacks against independent media, ranging from
   journalists? imprisonment to verbal attacks against outlets, carry an
   adverse effect for freedoms in democracies. Verbal attacks specifically
   provide leaders with a low-cost, easy to execute tool to delegitimize
   critical media. In this paper we present a theoretical contribution on
   when leaders in unconsolidated democracies verbally attack the media.
   Furthermore, we propose a way to quantitatively measure such attacks.
   Focusing on unconsolidated democracies, we argue that verbal attacks
   against independent media will increase when leaders face
   non-institutional ouster attempts like major protests and coups due to
   two reasons: 1) the surprise nature of these events, and 2) their
   disconnect to fully democratic means of staying in power. Our analysis
   examines verbal attacks on independent media by former Venezuelan
   president Hugo Ch?vez. We code 385 airings of Ch?vez?s weekly program
   Al? Presidente, from May 1999 to January 2012, counting verbal attacks
   against independent media. Using a Box-Tiao intervention model, we find
   Ch?vez?s verbal attacks against independent media significantly
   increased during non-institutional ouster efforts, such as major
   protests and the 2002 coup attempt. These findings show the degree to
   which elected leaders will go to discredit uncomfortable media outlets
   in unconsolidated democracies during uncertain political events.},

Abstract = {An important gap in the field of second language vocabulary research
   concerns the ability of Asian learners of English as a Foreign Language
   (EFL) to comprehend inflectional and derivational word family members.
   Japanese EFL learners (N=279) were divided into three lexical
   proficiency groups, and their ability to comprehend inflectional and
   derivational English forms was measured with an English to Japanese
   translation test. A significant difference among the participants'
   ability to comprehend 12 base forms, associated inflected forms, and
   associated derived forms was found across the three proficiency groups,
   and even among participants who demonstrated mastery of the first 4,000
   or 5,000 base forms of English. The flemma, a word's base form and
   associated inflectional forms, was found to be an appropriate word
   counting unit for most participants. Results are important because
   corpus research findings demonstrate that in cases where the word family
   provides 98 per cent coverage of texts, the flemma only provides 85 per
   cent coverage of the same texts. Thus, considering the detrimental
   impact to reading comprehension from only small decreases in the
   percentage of known tokens within a text, the results question the
   inferences made in word family-based research.},

Abstract = {This article reviews recent survey-based research on citizens' trust in

   long-term decline in trust and potential causes for this decline, with
   an emphasis on the effects of partisanship, polarization, performance,
   process, and media priming. While dispositions can anchor trust levels,
   the dominant research findings show that the sources of variation and
   change in trust are political, if multifaceted, in nature. We discuss
   new versions of standard measures, call for a renewed look at the
   distinction between trust in authorities and trust in the regime, review
   ongoing work on how and why trust matters, and recommend broadening the
   foci of mistrust to include antiestablishment sentiments and attacks on
   electoral integrity. How trust intervenes between perceptions of
   political processes and compliance with authoritative commands is a
   critical domain for additional research. We conclude with a caveat
   against confidence that the decline in trust can be quickly or easily

Abstract = {This paper describes disciplinary variation in university students'
   writing, as it is reflected in the use of recurrent four-word sequences.
   In contrast to previous studies, disciplinary categories are not assumed
   at the outset of the analysis, but rather emerge from an initial
   analysis of variation across all writers in the corpus. Variation is
   presented in the form of a visual map representing degrees of similarity
   and difference between individual writers. Emergent disciplinary
   groupings are then used as the basis for a qualitative analysis of
   distinctive lexical bundles. Analysis reveals four main disciplinary
   groupings. A primary distinction appears between hard
   (science/technology) and soft (humanities/social sciences) subjects,
   with two further groupings (life sciences and commerce) being
   intermediate between these two. Evidence is also found of cross-group
   disciplines, which draw on a variety of influences, and of particular
   disciplines which are internally heterogeneous. A qualitative analysis
   of bundles which are distinctive of ` hard' and ` soft' disciplines is
   presented in order to characterize the discourse functions which mark
   these categories.},

   in descriptions, depending on two key factors: seller experience and
   item condition (a high number of `new' listings for a particular seller
   is likely to be a sign of a more experienced seller). This paper
   describes the methods and approaches used to construct the eBay corpus
   and provides a detailed analysis of a sub-corpus of data as a means of
   identifying some of the key transactional and interactional features

Abstract = {This article presents a new method and open source R package that uses
   syntactic information to automatically extract source-subject-predicate
   clauses. This improves on frequency-based text analysis methods by
   dividing text into predicates with an identified subject and optional
   source, extracting the statements and actions of (political) actors as
   mentioned in the text. The content of these predicates can be analyzed
   using existing frequency-based methods, allowing for the analysis of
   actions, issue positions and framing by different actors within a single
   text. We show that a small set of syntactic patterns can extract clauses
   and identify quotes with good accuracy, significantly outperforming a
   baseline system based on word order. Taking the 2008-2009 Gaza war as an
   example, we further show how corpus comparison and semantic network
   analysis applied to the results of the clause analysis can show
   differences in citation and framing patterns between U.S. and
   English-language Chinese coverage of this war.},

Abstract = {This article investigates the public debate over proposed U.S.
   legislation designed to give prosecutors and copyright holders new tools
   to pursue suspected online copyright violations. We compiled, mapped,
   and analyzed a set of 9,757 stories published over 16 months relevant to
   the Combating Online Infringement and Counterfeits Act (COICA), Stop
   Online Piracy Act (SOPA), and PROTECT IP Act (PIPA). This study applies
   a mixed-methods approach that combines text and link analysis with human
   coding and informal interviews to map the evolution of the controversy
   over time and to analyze the mobilization, roles, and interactions of
   various actors. We find a vibrant, diverse, and decentralized networked
   public sphere that exhibited broad participation, leveraged topical
   expertise, and successfully reframed a debate and focused public
   sentiment to shape national public policy. A network of small-scale
   commercial tech media, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), and
   individuals fulfilled the fourth estate function; traditional media then
   amplified the work of these actors. The campaign involved substantial
   experimentation and rapid development of mobilization strategies. We
   observe an increased public awareness of an agenda originating in the
   networked public sphere, which emerged successfully despite substantial
   expenditures attempting to produce a mass media narrative that favored
   the legislation. Moreover, we witness what we call an attention
   backbone, in which more trafficked sites amplify less-visible individual
   voices on specific subjects. The data suggest that, at least in this
   case, the networked public sphere enabled a dynamic public discourse
   that involved both individual and organizational participants and
   offered substantive discussion of complex issues contributing to
   affirmative political action.},

Abstract = {The current study presents a New General Service List (new-GSL), which
   is a result of robust comparison of four language corpora (LOB, BNC,
   BE06, and EnTenTen12) of the total size of over 12 billion running
   words. The four corpora were selected to represent a variety of corpus
   sizes and approaches to representativeness and sampling. In particular,
   the study investigates the lexical overlap among the corpora in the top
   3,000 words based on the average reduced frequency (ARF), which is a
   measure that takes into consideration both frequency and dispersion of
   lexical items. The results show that there exists a stable vocabulary
   core of 2,122 items (70.7\%) among the four corpora. Moreover, these
   vocabulary items occur with comparable ranks in the individual
   wordlists. In producing the new-GSL, the core vocabulary items were
   combined with new items frequently occurring in the corpora representing
   current language use (BE06 and EnTenTen12). The final product of the
   study, the new-GSL, consists of 2,494 lemmas and covers between 80.1 and

Abstract = {Under what conditions can political elites influence elections to favor
   their preferred policy outcomes by strategically crafting the language
   printed on the ballot? Drawing on psychological and political theories
   of voter cognition, we design a survey experiment to assess the degree
   to which ballot text can influence voter behavior in direct democracy
   elections and identify factors that may moderate such effects. We show
   that the language used to describe a ballot measure does indeed have the
   potential to affect election outcomes, including measures dealing with
   contentious social issues affecting individual rights. We also find,
   however, that exposing individuals to basic campaign information-in our
   case, endorsements from prominent interest groups-greatly attenuates the
   framing effects of ballot text. Our results suggest that the extent to
   which ballot text matters depends on the vibrancy of the campaign
   environment and other information available to voters.},

Abstract = {This study shows how different phonetic productions of the same word
   pair perform different actions in conversation. The German words for
   ``yes{''} and ``but{''} share the same vowel at the word boundary: ja
   aber. Data from naturally occurring talk show that German speakers
   exploit this property of their language to differentiate between ja aber
   and jaber. The phonetic distinction co-occurs with a distinction in how
   actions are formatted. In ja aber turns, ja performs a separate action,
   often as a second pair part, providing an elicited confirming response.
   The action initiated by aber is typically disaffiliative and done for
   the first time. In contrast, jaber-fronted turns are rarely second pair
   parts and perform one single disaffiliative action, which is a redoing
   of a previously accomplished or attempted action. The frequent
   occurrence of jaber in the corpus suggests that the item is being used
   as a wordlike entity similar to a discourse marker. The findings reveal
   that for participants the local requirement to manage action boundaries
   is more relevant than linguistic word boundaries that may exist outside
   the interactional context. Data are in German with English translation.},

Abstract = {For second-language learners, the use of formulaic language can benefit
   processing. Previous studies have explored the development of a
   `processing advantage' for lexical bundles and investigated whether
   learning materials can be optimized via repetition or enhancement in
   order to facilitate it. However, studies have tended to consider these
   factors in isolation, and little is understood about how repetition and
   enhancement interact as learning occurs. This is the focus of the
   current study. Japanese learners of English read a series of short
   stories repeating enhanced or un-enhanced, low-frequency lexical
   bundles. After each reading, participants performed a phrasal judgement
   task (PJT) including these lexical bundles, as well as control lexical
   bundles not presented in the story. Responses were faster to items
   repeated in the stories, and there was an initial benefit from input
   enhancement. A post-test indicated that students retained some knowledge
   of the lexical bundles from both the stories, as well as from items that
   only appeared in the PJTs. This study shows that including
   high-frequency lexical bundles in such texts is beneficial to learners.},

   broadcasts and public conversations', `scripted speeches and unscripted
   speeches', `general prose and nondiscussion broadcasts', `press and
   fiction', `casual conversations', and `academic prose'. Metadiscourse
   markers of both dimensions are frequently used in registers of the first
   two clusters which are highly interactive and informational, while they
   rarely occur in registers of the next two clusters which have low
   interactive or informational focuses. Metadiscourse markers of
   participants' interaction are pervasive in the highly interactive
   register (casual conversations), and those of discourse presentation in
   the highly informational register (academic prose).},

Abstract = {Interest groups representing the marginalized regularly neglect advocacy
   on behalf of their most vulnerable constituents-those with
   intersectional disadvantage. Yet, they claim that such advocacy is
   central to their missions. I argue that interest groups representing
   women, people of color, Native nations, and the poor strategically
   conduct intersectional advocacy through coalitional lobbying. I test
   this claim using a new dataset of cosignature patterns within public
   comments on proposed federal agency rules submitted by a set of such
   groups between 2004 and 2014. I find that these groups are significantly
   more likely to pursue intersectional advocacy in coalitions but that
   coalition work, alone, does not relate to influential intersectional
   advocacy. Rather, it is particular coalition characteristics, including
   organizational diversity and financial capacity, that predict such
   influence. I conclude that collaborative lobbying is an effective tactic
   for mediating representational bias in interest group advocacy and
   promoting more pluralistic administrative policy making.},

Title = {A Dynamic Measure of Bureaucratic Reputation: New Data for New Theory},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Abstract = {Bureaucratic reputation is one of the most important concepts used to
   understand the behavior of administrative agencies and their
   interactions with multiple audiences. Despite a rich theoretical
   literature discussing reputation, we do not have a comparable measure
   across agencies, between countries, and over time. I present a new
   strategy to measure bureaucratic reputation from legislative speeches
   with word-embedding techniques. I introduce an original dataset on the
   reputation of 465 bureaucratic bodies over a period of 40 years, and
   across two countries-the U.S. and the U.K. I perform several validation
   tests and present an application of this method to investigate whether
   partisanship and agency politicization matter for reputation. I find
   that agencies enjoy a better reputation among the members of the party
   in government, with partisan differences less pronounced for independent
   bodies. Finally, I discuss how this measurement strategy can contribute
   to classical and new questions about political-administrative
   interactions.},

Title = {Who Rallies Around the Flag? Nationalist Parties, National Security, and
   the 2019 Indian Election},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Abstract = {National security crises often generate a `rally-around-the-flag'
   effect, especially under nationalist administrations, but the salience
   of a security crisis varies within a country. Does exposure to a crisis
   intensify rallying by fomenting nationalism, inciting hawkishness, and
   distracting from quotidian economic concerns? Or does exposure deepen
   dissatisfaction with the incumbent, thereby reducing a rallying effect?
   We argue the latter using evidence from a difficult test in India. A
   major pre-election terrorist attack boosted the nationwide popularity of
   the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the nationalist ruling party. Yet we
   find that proximity to the victims' funeral processions, which served as
   patriotic rallies, substantially reduced BJP support where the party was
   incumbent. The size and breadth of our observed effects indicate that
   the social commemoration of the attack, rather than direct personal
   connections to its victims, fuelled anti-incumbent sentiment. Mobilizing
   collective anger after a crisis may dampen rather than augment a
   rally-around-the-flag effect.},

Journal = {APPLIED LINGUISTICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {43},

Abstract = {For second-language learners, the use of formulaic language can benefit
   processing. Previous studies have explored the development of a
   `processing advantage' for lexical bundles and investigated whether
   learning materials can be optimized via repetition or enhancement in
   order to facilitate it. However, studies have tended to consider these
   factors in isolation, and little is understood about how repetition and
   enhancement interact as learning occurs. This is the focus of the
   current study. Japanese learners of English read a series of short
   stories repeating enhanced or un-enhanced, low-frequency lexical
   bundles. After each reading, participants performed a phrasal judgement
   task (PJT) including these lexical bundles, as well as control lexical
   bundles not presented in the story. Responses were faster to items
   repeated in the stories, and there was an initial benefit from input
   enhancement. A post-test indicated that students retained some knowledge
   of the lexical bundles from both the stories, as well as from items that
   only appeared in the PJTs. This study shows that including
   high-frequency lexical bundles in such texts is beneficial to learners.},

Year = {2022},
Volume = {43},
Number = {2},
Pages = {365-388},

Abstract = {Drawing on linguistic ethnographic data, this study examines the
   language-based discriminatory experiences of skilled transnational
   migrants in the labour market of Australia. Moving beyond two main
   concepts of `interlingual' and `intra-lingual' discrimination in applied
   linguistics, this article points out the concept of `translingual
   discrimination', which refers to inequality based on transnational
   identities' specific linguistic repertoires and backgrounds that are
   substantiated by the national order of things. Translingual
   discrimination adds intensity to transnational processes, with the
   skilled migrants showing particular potential for exclusion regarding
   two factors: translingual `name discrimination' and `English
   discrimination'. `Translingual name discrimination' is a homogenous form
   of `name' policing, evident in multiple examples where the skilled
   transnational migrants' job applications are often largely rejected on
   the grounds of their `birth name' written on their curriculum vitae.
   `Translingual English discrimination' is another common form of
   discrimination, where the skilled transnational migrants become subject
   to discrimination based on their English proficiency and their overall
   language skills, leading to `the paradoxes of migration'-discrepancies
   between the imagination and the reality-where they fall from `hero to
   zero' in the host society.},

Abstract = {This study examines participation in language play (LP) during
   spontaneous multiparty talk in a Foreign Language Housing (FLH) program.
   FLH programs represent hybrid spaces where talk emerges naturally for
   social reasons but is framed under an institutional purpose for language
   learning. Given its multi-functional ability to simultaneously
   coordinate both sociable humor and learning-in-interaction, LP emerges
   as a salient resource in such dual-purpose environments. Using a
   multimodal Conversation Analysis of two extended sequences of LP during
   mealtime conversations, this study analyzes how FLH participants deploy
   verbal and embodied resources to organize participation in LP. It then
   illustrates how these strategies dynamically orient to sociability and
   learning, thereby constructing a hybrid social-and-learning
   interactional space. As prior studies of LP and learning draw primarily
   from classroom dyadic conversations, this study sheds additional light
   on the role of LP in regulating multiparty social talk, with application
   to understanding the interactional organization of informal
   immersion-based language learning programs.},

Abstract = {Speech and dialogue are the heart of politics: nearly every political
   institution in the world involves verbal communication. Yet vast
   literatures on political communication focus almost exclusively on what
   words were spoken, entirely ignoring how they were delivered-auditory
   cues that convey emotion, signal positions, and establish reputation. We
   develop a model that opens this information to principled statistical
   inquiry: the model of audio and speech structure (MASS). Our approach
   models political speech as a stochastic process shaped by fixed and
   time-varying covariates, including the history of the conversation
   itself. In an application to Supreme Court oral arguments, we
   demonstrate how vocal tone signals crucial information-skepticism of
   legal arguments-that is indecipherable to text models. Results show that
   justices do not use questioning to strategically manipulate their peers
   but rather engage sincerely with the presented arguments. Our
   easy-to-use R package, communication, implements the model and many more
   tools for audio analysis.},

Abstract = {Bureaucratic discretion and executive delegation are central topics in
   political economy and political science. The previous empirical
   literature has measured discretion and delegation by manually coding
   large bodies of legislation. Drawing from computational linguistics, we
   provide an automated procedure for measuring discretion and delegation
   in legal texts to facilitate large-scale empirical analysis. The method
   uses information in syntactic parse trees to identify legally relevant
   provisions, as well as agents and delegated actions. We undertake two
   applications. First, we produce a measure of bureaucratic discretion by
   looking at the level of legislative detail for US states and find that
   this measure increases after reforms giving agencies more independence.
   This effect is consistent with an agency cost model, where a more
   independent bureaucracy requires more specific instructions (less
   discretion) to avoid bureaucratic drift. Second, we construct measures
   of delegation to governors in state legislation. Consistent with
   previous estimates using non-text metrics, we find that executive
   delegation increases under unified government.},

Abstract = {Democracies around the world are facing a rising wave of right-wing
   populism and new nationalism, which often relies on strategic
   exploitation of anti-immigration sentiments. While media have long been
   acknowledged as important channels of anti-immigration rhetoric, the
   evidence of the actual impact of news consumption on attitudes to
   migration and support for populist parties is still inconclusive, and
   largely limited to pre-digital media ecologies. Combining a
   representative two-wave panel survey (N=819), digital tracking of
   real-time electronic measurement of television, radio and online media
   exposure, and an analysis of news content, this study explores the
   effect of news consumption on anti-immigration attitudes and electoral
   behaviour during the EP2019 election campaign in the Czech Republic. Our
   analysis reveals that being exposed to news about migration -
   particularly on websites and on commercial television stations -
   increases the likelihood of voting for populist parties, while exposure
   to public service media leads to less negative attitudes towards
   immigration. At the same time, being exposed to more news sources
   intensifies, rather than reduces, anti-immigrant attitudes. This result
   challenges the assumption that a more diverse news media diet could
   serve as an antidote to selective exposure and ``echo chambers{''},
   commonly linked with radicalization of political views.},

Abstract = {This article investigates the communicative styles of three different
   peer mentors in the context of online language learning, and considers
   their effect on student engagement. A key objective is to show how an
   innovative corpus-based technique, keyword analysis, can be used as a
   first step towards identifying communicative styles. We view
   communicative style as a linguistic means by which rapport is managed
   amongst participants (Spencer-Oatey 2008). Our primary data include 685
   forum posts, of which 273 (over 26,000 words) were by the mentors at the
   heart of our study. We show that the three mentors have different
   communicative styles: different rapport management orientations are
   achieved in different ways. Furthermore, we bring together multiple data
   sources, including participants' posts and self-reported perception
   data. This allows us to find evidence on if and how communicative styles
   impact on student engagement and perception. We discovered that rapport
   enhancement aligns with increased active participation, especially if a
   self-effacement strategy is used, and positive student perception, but
   that the lack of such rapport does not automatically imply negative
   student perception.},

Title = {Language Testing in the `Hostile Environment': The Discursive
   Construction of `Secure English Language Testing' in the UK},
Journal = {APPLIED LINGUISTICS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {41},

Abstract = {In parallel with an increased focus on border security in immigration
   and citizenship policy in the UK (the so-called `hostile environment'
   policy), Government-approved English language tests for visa and
   immigration purposes were officially labelled `Secure English Language
   Tests' (SELTs) in 2010. The proximity of security concerns in language
   testing with broader national immigration policy objectives suggests a
   complex role for language tests as gatekeeping devices. This article
   draws on critical discourse studies to explore this issue. Documents
   provided in the 2014 tender round for selecting Secure English Language
   Tests (acquired through a Freedom of Information request) were analysed
   through a discourse-historical lens (Reisigl and Wodak 2016) to map
   salient topics and identify discursive strategies used to construct
   `secure English language testing'. Findings show that security is a
   prominent topic in the tender; prospective bidders are required to meet
   detailed security requirements and to police subcontractors, and social
   actors, spaces, objects, policies and procedures are routinely described
   in securitized terms. Implications are drawn for understanding the role
   of language tests within broader securitization processes.},

Abstract = {How do stigmatized minorities advance agendas when confronted with
   hostile majorities? Elite theories of influence posit marginal groups
   exert little power. I propose the concept of agenda seeding to describe
   how activists use methods like disruption to capture the attention of
   media and overcome political asymmetries. Further, I hypothesize protest
   tactics influence how news organizations frame demands. Evaluating
   black-led protests between 1960 and 1972, I find nonviolent activism,
   particularly when met with state or vigilante repression, drove media
   coverage, framing, congressional speech, and public opinion on civil
   rights. Counties proximate to nonviolent protests saw presidential
   Democratic vote share increase 1.6-2.5\%. Protester-initiated violence,
   by contrast, helped move news agendas, frames, elite discourse, and
   public concern toward ``social control.{''} In 1968, using rainfall as
   an instrument, I find violent protests likely caused a 1.5-7.9\% shift
   among whites toward Republicans and tipped the election. Elites may
   dominate political communication but hold no monopoly.},

Abstract = {Journalists have argued that the high levels of hostility between
   President Trump and numerous media outlets have marked a critical
   juncture in presidential-press relations. This perceived conflict
   challenges a key expectation of literatures on political media and the
   presidency: that functional interdependence will encourage presidential
   administrations to tolerate more aggressive media questioning in an
   effort to control media messages. We examine the interactions between
   U.S. presidential administrations and the White House press corps
   through thirty-five years of press briefing transcripts to assess the
   underpinnings of the current shift. We evaluate key hypotheses via a
   sentiment analysis using the NRC Emotional Lexicon. Generally, each side
   tends to reinforce, or mirror, positive and negative language of the
   counterparty during press briefings. However, we find a significant
   disjunction with the Trump Administration. Trump Administration
   representatives use negative language at higher rates than previous
   administrations and respond more sensitively to changes in press tone by
   decreasing positive language in response to press negativity. We discuss
   implications for the dynamic role of the media in shaping these changes.},

Abstract = {Scholars have come to understand fake news as content packaged to look

   labelled `fake news' following the 2016 US election campaign, with an
   eye to understanding their stated values and how such sites might mimic
   other journalistic forms. Findings from a qualitative textual analysis
   reveal an open commitment to ideological, activist and value-driven
   reporting by the sites. Outlets openly disclose their biases, attack the
   mainstream media and privilege truths from subjective perspectives,
   appealing to partisan audiences disillusioned with the mainstream press.
   In light of our analysis, we argue that fake news producers should be
   understood as hybrid actors mimicking features of both mainstream and
   alternative journalism in a manner that results in interpretive partisan
   news communities.},

Abstract = {There is a worry that serious forms of political conflict, in
   particular, uncivil behavior of politicians, increases political
   cynicism and demobilizes the public. Despite the close relation of
   incivility with social and cultural norms of what is an acceptable form
   of discussion, studies are mostly restricted to one country. To overcome
   this blind spot, we conduct a cross-national experiment in three
   countries (the Netherlands, UK and Spain) testing whether civil and
   uncivil forms of mediated political conflict affect cynicism toward the
   EU, political participation intentions, and the support for the policies
   discussed. Results indicate that despite different levels of conflict in
   the news, and different levels of cynicism and participation in these
   countries, the effects of incivility are homogenous. Uncivil political
   conflict has negative effects on political participation intention and
   policy support but does not significantly affect cynicism ? in each of
   the three countries. We also test the role of an individual-level
   factor, namely Tolerance for Disagreement (TfD). Citizens with low
   levels of TfD are more affected by uncivil conflict, while subjects with
   high TfD seem to be immune against violations of social norms. We
   discuss these finding against the backdrop of individual and cultural
   influences on political communication effects and cross-cultural
   experimental research in more general terms.},

   published to alert readers that, while the authors of the paper believed
   they had sufficient authorization to use the 2012 Latino Decisions
   Election Eve Survey data in the article's analysis, the appropriate
   Latino Decisions principals had not granted that permission. Following
   an investigation, the Journal Co-Editors have decided to let the
   published article stand and will take no further action. Latino
   Decisions agrees with this decision. The dataset has been removed from
   the Journal's Harvard Dataverse webpage. This Expression of Concern
   relates to the article ``Tuning In, Not Turning Out: Evaluating the

   Library (wileyonlinelibrary.com), which has been published at the
   request of journal Editor Jan Leighley, in agreement with Wiley
   Periodicals, Inc. The Expression of Concern is published due to the
   possibility that the authors did not have sufficient authorization from
   Latino Decisions to use the 2012 Latino Decisions Election Eve Survey
   data used in the analysis. This concern arose following notification to
   the Editor that the data posted on the AJPS Harvard Dataverse webpage ()
   were proprietary and had not been authorized for use in the article at
   the time the manuscript was submitted for peer review, nor approved for
   posting upon publication, consistent with the AJPS Replication Policy.
   Further actions by the Journal will be taken once the results of an
   investigation into the authors' rights to use the data during peer
   review and in the published manuscript have been announced.},

Abstract = {This paper opens the ``black box{''} of real-world deliberation by using
   text-as-data methods on a corpus of transcripts from the
   constitutionally mandated gram sabhas, or village assemblies, of rural
   India. Drawing on normative theories of deliberation, we identify
   empirical standards for ``good{''} deliberation based on one's ability
   both to speak and to be heard, and use natural language processing
   methods to generate these measures. We first show that, even in the
   rural Indian context, these assemblies are not mere ``talking shops,{''}
   but rather provide opportunities for citizens to challenge their elected
   officials, demand transparency, and provide information about local
   development needs. Second, we find that women are at a disadvantage
   relative to men; they are less likely to speak, set the agenda, and
   receive a relevant response from state officials. And finally, we show
   that quotas for women for village presidencies improve the likelihood
   that female citizens are heard.},

Abstract = {Political scientists lack domain-specific measures for the purpose of
   measuring the sophistication of political communication. We
   systematically review the shortcomings of existing approaches, before
   developing a new and better method along with software tools to apply
   it. We use crowdsourcing to perform thousands of pairwise comparisons of
   text snippets and incorporate these results into a statistical model of
   sophistication. This includes previously excluded features such as parts
   of speech and a measure of word rarity derived from dynamic term
   frequencies in the Google Books data set. Our technique not only shows
   which features are appropriate to the political domain and how, but also
   provides a measure easily applied and rescaled to political texts in a
   way that facilitates probabilistic comparisons. We reanalyze the State
   of the Union corpus to demonstrate how conclusions differ when using our
   improved approach, including the ability to compare complexity as a
   function of covariates.},

Volume = {40},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {In this article we explore the ways in which academic citation practices
   have changed over the past 50 years. Based on the analysis of a corpus
   of 2.2 million words from the same leading journals in four disciplines
   in 1965, 1985, and 2015, we document a substantial rise in citations
   over the period, particularly in applied linguistics and sociology. This
   is partly because there is now so much more research to report and that
   recognizing previous work is much easier as a result of electronic
   access and hyperlinks to sources. But citation is also increasingly
   required as a means of appropriately embedding research more securely in
   disciplinary understandings. Our results also show a fall in the use of
   reporting structures, a growing preference for non-integral forms, for
   research verbs, for the present tense, and for non-evaluative structures
   when reporting others' research. While patterns differ by discipline,
   there is a general trend towards writers suppressing human agency in
   knowledge-making and emphasizing the reported studies rather than those
   who conducted them to show how earlier research supports their own.},

Volume = {40},
Number = {1},
Pages = {176-197},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {This article is a conceptual and methodological exploration of a new
   construct, task interactional difficulty, and of a possible approach to
   assessing task demands in general. After arguing for the use of `task
   difficulty' instead of `task complexity', the notion of task
   interactional difficulty is analyzed, first by reviewing previous SLA
   research, then by elaborating an explicit theoretical definition. An
   operationalization is suggested in terms of three dimensions: number of
   turn exchanges, number of initiating moves, and visual access among
   participants. The first two parameters can be measured on native
   speakers' task performance, while the third may be assessed with two
   categorical values. To demonstrate the feasibility of this approach,
   these measures are applied to a corpus of native speakers of Italian
   performing six different oral tasks, which are then ranked according to
   their interactional difficulty. Implications for SLA research and
   task-based language teaching and assessment are discussed, as well as
   possible ways of extending this procedure to other types of tasks and
   other facets of difficulty.},

Title = {Using Big Data and Algorithms to Determine the Effect of Geographically

   Presidential Election},
Journal = {POLITICAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {36},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-16},
Month = {JAN 2},
Abstract = {We develop a new conceptualization of political advertising effects by
   looking at the effect of the marginal advertising dollar during the heat
   of presidential campaigns. We argue that in contrast to other studies
   investigating effects of political ads, our approach is more apt to
   capture the natural environment in which political ads are encountered
   during a presidential campaign. We focus on the intense inundation of
   political ads voters are confronted with in swing states in the weeks
   leading up to the presidential election, and argue that it is unclear a
   priori whether we should expect advertising to affect vote intention in
   that critical circumstance. We empirically validate this hypothesis
   using a trove of data from the 2012 campaign: daily polling in media
   markets around the country, detailed data on all registered voters in
   the country, all TV advertisements by market and exact airtime, and the
   entire Twitter corpus. We find that neither overall increases in
   advertising spending nor partisan imbalances in spending expanded the
   candidates' electorate. In fact, total Designated Market Area
   (DMA)-level spending significantly moderates a negative relationship
   between spending advantages and advantages in vote intention, suggesting
   a boomerang effect of additional spending late in the campaign. In
   closing, we discuss the ramifications of our findings for future
   research, and stress the importance of research tracking advertising
   effects.},

Abstract = {This study assesses the potential of topic models coupled with machine
   translation for comparative communication research across language
   barriers. From a methodological point of view, the robustness of a
   combined approach is examined. For this purpose the results of different
   machine translation services (Google Translate vs. DeepL) as well as
   methods (full-text vs. term-by-term) are compared. From a substantive
   point of view, the integratability of the approach into comparative
   study designs is tested. For this, the online discourses about climate
   change in Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States are
   compared. First, the results show that the approach is relatively robust
   and second, that integration in comparative study designs is not a
   problem. It is concluded that this as well as the relatively moderate
   costs in terms of time and money makes the strategy to couple topic
   models with machine translation a valuable addition to the toolbox of
   comparative communication researchers.},

Abstract = {Populism is the name of a global phenomenon whose definitional
   precariousness is proverbial. It resists generalizations and makes
   scholars of politics comparativist by necessity, as its language and
   content are imbued with the political culture of the society in which it
   arises. A rich body of socio-historical analyses allows us to situate
   populism within the global phenomenon called democracy, as its
   ideological core is nourished by the two main entities-the nation and
   the people-that have fleshed out popular sovereignty in the age of
   democratization. Populism consists in a transmutation of the democratic
   principles of the majority and the people in a way that is meant to
   celebrate one subset of the people as opposed to another, through a
   leader embodying it and an audience legitimizing it. This may make
   populism collide with constitutional democracy, even if its main tenets
   are embedded in the democratic universe of meanings and language. In
   this article, I illustrate the context-based character of populism and
   how its cyclical appearances reflect the forms of representative
   government. I review the main contemporary interpretations of the
   concept and argue that some basic agreement now exists on populism's
   rhetorical character and its strategy for achieving power in democratic
   societies. Finally, I sketch the main characteristics of populism in
   power and explain how it tends to transform the fundamentals of
   democracy: the people and the majority, elections, and representation.},

Abstract = {Although anonymity is a central feature of liberal democracies-not only
   in the secret ballot, but also in campaign funding, publishing political
   texts, masked protests, and graffiti-it has so far not been conceptually
   grounded in democratic theory. Rather, it is treated as a
   self-explanatory concept related to privacy. To overcome this omission,
   this article develops a complex understanding of anonymity in the
   context of democratic theory. Drawing upon the diverse literature on
   anonymity in political participation, it explains anonymity as a highly
   context-dependent identity performance expressing private sentiments in
   the public sphere. The contradictory character of its core
   elements-identity negation and identity creation-results in three sets
   of contradictory freedoms. Anonymity affords (a) inclusion and
   exclusion, (b) subversion and submission, and (c) honesty and deception.
   This contradictory character of anonymity's affordances illustrates the
   ambiguous role of anonymity in democracy.},

Abstract = {We use plausibly exogenous variation in the availability of the Russian

   conspicuous political agenda impacts political behavior and attitudes.
   Using highly disaggregated election data and an original survey, we
   estimate that Russian television substantially increased average
   electoral support for parties and candidates with a ``pro-Russian{''}
   agenda in the 2014 presidential and parliamentary elections. Evidence
   suggests that this effect is attributable to persuasion rather than
   differential mobilization. The effectiveness of biased media varied in a
   politically consequential way: Its impact was largest on voters with
   strong pro-Russian priors but was less effective, and to some degree
   even counter-effective, in persuading those with strong pro-Western
   priors. Our finding suggests that exposing an already polarized society
   to a biased media source can result in even deeper polarization.},

Abstract = {While critical discourse analysis (CDA) is largely an interpretative
   exercise, it places an emphasis on `triangulation' as a guiding
   methodological principle intended to help ground analyses and guard
   against purely subjective readings of texts. Missing from CDA, however,
   is triangulation incorporating experimental methodologies. In this
   paper, I argue that CDA in general can benefit from an experimental
   dimension and that cognitive linguistic approaches in particular lend
   themselves to extension into experimentalism. I demonstrate this by
   reporting a recent experiment carried out within a cognitive linguistic
   framework on the effects of regular transactive versus reciprocal verbs
   in news reports of political protests. Results of the experiment show
   that in the context of media discourse on political protests, the
   presentation of these alternative constructions, as well as differences
   in information sequence, affect how people apportion blame and the level
   of aggression they perceive in social actors. The experiment thus not
   only provides evidence for the ideological effects of these particular
   linguistic differences but more generally goes some way to justifying
   CDA's focus on micro-level lexico-grammatical features of texts.},

Abstract = {This study contributes to ongoing discussions on how measures of lexical
   diversity (LD) can help discriminate between essays from second language
   learners of English, whose work has been assessed as belonging to levels
   B1 to C2 of the Common European Framework of Reference (CEFR). The focus
   is, in particular, on how different operationalizations of what
   constitutes a `different word' (type) impact on the LD measures
   themselves and on their ability to discriminate between CEFR levels. The
   results show that basic measures of LD, such as the number of different
   words, the TTR (Templin 1957), and the Index of Guiraud (Guiraud 1954)
   explain more variance in the CEFR levels than sophisticated measures,
   such as D (Malvern et al. 2004), HD-D (McCarthy and Jarvis 2007), and
   MTLD (McCarthy 2005) provided text length is kept constant across texts.
   A simple count of different words (defined as lemma's and not as word
   families) was the best predictor of CEFR levels and explained 22 per
   cent of the variance in overall scores on the Pearson Test of English
   Academic in essays written by 176 test takers.},

Abstract = {Despite the popularity of unsupervised techniques for political science
   text-as-data research, the importance and implications of preprocessing
   decisions in this domain have received scant systematic attention. Yet,
   as we show, such decisions have profound effects on the results of real
   models for real data. We argue that substantive theory is typically too
   vague to be of use for feature selection, and that the supervised
   literature is not necessarily a helpful source of advice. To aid
   researchers working in unsupervised settings, we introduce a statistical
   procedure and software that examines the sensitivity of findings under
   alternate preprocessing regimes. This approach complements a
   researcher's substantive understanding of a problem by providing a
   characterization of the variability changes in preprocessing choices may
   induce when analyzing a particular dataset. In making scholars aware of
   the degree to which their results are likely to be sensitive to their
   preprocessing decisions, it aids replication efforts.},

Title = {The Authentic Appeal of the Lying Demagogue: Proclaiming the Deeper

Journal = {AMERICAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {83},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-33},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {We develop and test a theory to address a puzzling pattern that has been
   discussed widely since the 2016 U.S. presidential election and
   reproduced here in a post-election survey: how can a constituency of
   voters find a candidate authentically appealing (i.e., view him
   positively as authentic) even though he is a lying demagogue (someone
   who deliberately tells lies and appeals to non-normative private
   prejudices)? Key to the theory are two points: (1) common-knowledge lies
   may be understood as flagrant violations of the norm of truth-telling;
   and (2) when a political system is suffering from a crisis of legitimacy
   (Lipset 1959) with respect to at least one political constituency,
   members of that constituency will be motivated to see a flagrant
   violator of established norms as an authentic champion of its interests.
   Two online vignette experiments on a simulated college election support
   our theory. These results demonstrate that mere partisanship is
   insufficient to explain sharp differences in how lying demagoguery is
   perceived, and that several oft-discussed factorsinformation access,
   culture, language, and genderare not necessary for explaining such
   differences. Rather, for the lying demagogue to have authentic appeal,
   it is sufficient that one side of a social divide regards the political
   system as flawed or illegitimate.},

Abstract = {Does English always play an important role in constructing identities
   within the multimodal ad? This question has wide-ranging implications
   for the study of identity constructions in bilingual advertising in
   particular, and for bilingualism and multilingualism generally. This
   article presents a critical-cognitive approach that is an evidence-based
   account of whether, and to what extent, English plays a role in identity
   constructions and their connection to the local politics of English.
   This approach is analytically powerful and productive not only in
   capturing the varying degrees of the contribution of the English
   language and its role but also in unraveling the ideological dimensions
   of identity and the English language. Examples of Chinese-English
   bilingual ads that are representative of the structural features of
   English mixing are used for the illustrative analysis. The article
   concludes with a suggestion of the wider applicability of this approach
   to other bilingual or multilingual contexts that are currently regarded
   as suitable for study.},

   Study},
Journal = {APPLIED LINGUISTICS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {38},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The current study investigated linguistic influences on
   comprehensibility (ease of understanding) and accentedness (linguistic
   nativelikeness) in second language (L2) learners' extemporaneous speech.
   Target materials included picture narratives from 40 native French
   speakers of English from different proficiency levels. The narratives
   were subsequently rated by 20 native speakers with or without linguistic
   and pedagogical experience for comprehensibility, accentedness, and 11
   linguistic variables spanning the domains of phonology, lexis, grammar,
   and discourse structure. Results showed that comprehensibility was
   associated with several linguistic variables (vowel/consonant errors,
   word stress, fluency, lexis, grammar), whereas accentedness was chiefly
   linked to pronunciation (vowel/consonant errors, word stress).
   Native-speaking listeners thus appear to pay particular attention to
   pronunciation, rather than lexis and grammar, to evaluate nativelikeness
   but tend to consider various sources of linguistic information in L2
   speech in judging comprehensibility. The use of listener ratings
   (perceptual measures) in evaluating linguistic aspects of learner speech
   and their implications for language assessment and pedagogy are
   discussed.},

   the efficacy of the language assistance provisions to the duration and
   consistency of coverage and the presence of federal elections observers.
   Overall, our study underscores the continued need for federal government

Abstract = {Empirical social science often relies on data that are not observed in
   the field, but are transformed into quantitative variables by expert
   researchers who analyze and interpret qualitative raw sources. While
   generally considered the most valid way to produce data, this
   expert-driven process is inherently difficult to replicate or to assess
   on grounds of reliability. Using crowd-sourcing to distribute text for
   reading and interpretation by massive numbers of nonexperts, we generate
   results comparable to those using experts to read and interpret the same
   texts, but do so far more quickly and flexibly. Crucially, the data we
   collect can be reproduced and extended transparently, making
   crowd-sourced datasets intrinsically reproducible. This focuses
   researchers' attention on the fundamental scientific objective of
   specifying reliable and replicable methods for collecting the data
   needed, rather than on the content of any particular dataset. We also
   show that our approach works straightforwardly with different types of
   political text, written in different languages. While findings reported
   here concern text analysis, they have far-reaching implications for
   expert-generated data in the social sciences.},

Journal = {POLITICAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2016},

Number = {4},
Pages = {605-627},
Abstract = {Political agenda-setting studies have shown that political agendas are
   influenced by the media agenda. Researchers in the field of media and
   politics are now focusing on the mechanisms underlying this pattern.
   This article contributes to the literature by focusing not on aggregate,
   behavioral political attention for issues (e.g., parliamentary questions
   or legislation), but on Members of Parliament's (MP) individual,
   cognitive attention for specific news stories. Drawing upon a survey of
   Belgian MPs administered shortly after exposure to news stories, the
   study shows that MPs are highly selective in exploiting media cues. They
   pay more attention to both prominent and useful news stories, but a
   story's usefulness is more important for cognitive processes that are
   closely linked to MPs' real behavior in parliament. In other words,
   aggregate political agenda-setting effects are a consequence of the way
   in which individual MPs process media information that matches their
   task-related needs.},

Journal = {DIGITAL JOURNALISM},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {4},
Number = {6},
Pages = {764-783},
Abstract = {Many news organizations provide online readers with an opportunity to
   comment on public issues in the news through a news-mediated forum for
   discourse. These spaces are provided by news organizations as part of a
   mission to provide a public space for discourse, but are governed by a
   commenting policy that establishes the rules for discourse and behavior.
   These rules can help to meet the ideals of public discourse or stand in
   the way of productive public deliberation. This study examines the
   commenting policies of 21 news corporations in the United States to see
   how the policies facilitate or inhibit the creation of a space for ideal
   public discourse. A constant comparative analysis of the policies guided
   by the ideals of Habermas' public sphere, as well as the expectations of
   civility norms, shows that news organizations establish rules to protect
   respectful and egalitarian spaces for the public, but fail to meet other
   critical needs of public discourse, including rationality, tolerance,
   reflexivity, and the pursuit of common understanding and solutions. The
   implications of these findings are further explored and possible
   objectives for news organizations are provided.},

Journal = {AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {109},
Number = {4},
Pages = {674-689},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Although all theories that oppose the subordination of women can be
   called feminist, beyond this common denominator, feminisms vary in terms
   of what they see as the cause of women's subordination, alternatives to
   patriarchal society, and proposed strategies to achieve the desired
   change. This article offers a critical examination of the interaction of
   feminist theories and the international human rights discourses as
   articulated at the UN forums and documents. It contends that although a
   range of feminisms that elucidate the diversity of women's experiences
   and complexities of oppression have been incorporated into some UN
   documents, the overall women's rights approach of the UN is still
   informed by the demands and expectations of liberal feminism. This is
   particularly evident in the aggregate indicators that are employed to
   assess the empowerment of women. In addition to explaining why liberal
   feminism trumps other feminisms, the article addresses the problems with
   following policies that are informed by liberal feminism. Noting that
   the integrative approach of liberal feminism may establish gender
   equality without empowering the majority of women, it criticizes using
   aggregate indicators of empowerment for conflating sources of power with
   empowerment and making false assumptions.},

Abstract = {When defined in terms of social identity and affect toward copartisans

   for the opposing party are ingrained or automatic in voters' minds, and
   that affective polarization based on party is just as strong as
   polarization based on race. We further show that party cues exert
   powerful effects on nonpolitical judgments and behaviors. Partisans
   discriminate against opposing partisans, doing so to a degree that
   exceeds discrimination based on race. We note that the willingness of
   partisans to display open animus for opposing partisans can be
   attributed to the absence of norms governing the expression of negative
   sentiment and that increased partisan affect provides an incentive for
   elites to engage in confrontation rather than cooperation.},

Volume = {36},

Abstract = {Research on the linguistic characteristics of university classroom
   discourse highlights the salience, in this register, of
   non-informational and subjective aspects of discourse. This dimension of
   classroom discourse, however, has not been studied systematically.
   Taking a corpus-based approach, this study investigates the
   non-informational dimension of classroom discourse, focusing on the
   marking of emotions, affect, and the speaker's `involvement' (Chafe
   1982) in the talk of university professors, in a large corpus of
   American university classroom discourse. It tracks the use of
   involvement markers across class sessions representing three situational
   factors that define the university setting: academic discipline, level
   of instruction, and class size. Surprisingly, these factors have
   relatively little influence on involvement in language, suggesting that
   involvement is pervasive in American classroom talk. However,
   involvement tends to be more common in small courses in the Humanities
   and Social Sciences, at the upper division and graduate level-courses
   that generally favor student participation, hence interactivity in
   discourse. Analyses of the relationship between involvement and
   interactivity reveal that while interactivity tends to predict
   involvement, involvement is not limited to interactive discourse.},

Volume = {32},
Number = {2},
Pages = {310-330},
Month = {APR 3},
Abstract = {This study draws on the ``cascading activation{''} model of press-state
   relations to explore U.S. political and news discourse surrounding the
   1968 My Lai Massacre. We systematically analyze White House, military,
   congressional, and news communications and draw upon scholarship in
   social psychology to assess why the press might challenge certain frames
   in response to My Lai but indiscriminately echo others. In particular,
   within these communications, we examine how serious and widespread the
   actions at My Lai were conveyed to be, how the circumstances were
   portrayed, how the actors involved in the incident were characterized,
   and the extent to which America's core values were questioned. Our
   findings suggest that the Nixon administration employed frames designed
   to downplay the severity of the My Lai incident, highlight extenuating
   circumstances faced by those directly involved, denigrate the alleged
   low-level perpetrators, and bolster the national identity. These frames
   were then largely echoed in the press, despite consistent and forceful
   challenges by congressional Democrats. These findings, we argue, align
   with the cascading activation model, and we build on it by highlighting
   the underlying importance of ``cultural resonance{''} in the framing
   process. We reflect on the theoretical and practical implications of
   these patterns and, in doing so, engage the broader scholarly debate
   over the process through which U.S. news coverage aligns with the
   communications of government officials, particularly in moments of
   national dissonance.},

Title = {Informing the Leader: Bureaucracies and International Crises},
Journal = {AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},
Abstract = {Whether international crises end in conflict frequently depends on the
   information that leaders possess. To better explain how leaders acquire
   information, I develop and test an informational theory of bureaucracies
   during crises. Time-constrained leaders delegate information collection
   to advisers who lead bureaucracies. A division of labor between
   bureaucracies breeds comparative specialization among advisers. Some
   emphasize information on adversaries' political attributes, which are
   harder to assess; others stress military attributes, which are easier to
   assess. Bureaucratic role thus affects the content and uncertainty that
   advisers provide. I use automated and qualitative coding to measure
   adviser input in 5,400 texts from US Cold War crises. As hypothesized,
   advisers' positions affect the information and uncertainty they convey
   but not the policies they promote as canonical theories suggest. For
   individuals advising leaders during crises, what you know depends on
   where you sit. Consequently, the information leaders possess hinges on
   which bureaucracies have their attention.},

Title = {Journalism and Democratic Backsliding: Critical Realism as a Diagnostic
   and Prescription for Reform},
Journal = {POLITICAL COMMUNICATION},
Abstract = {Renewed scrutiny of how U.S. journalism functions as a political
   institution is warranted in an era of democratic backsliding. While news
   media cannot deliver policy on their own, they are fully equipped to
   represent, interpret, and amplify grievance. If disaffection is directed
   at retribution rather than policy, journalism contributes to backsliding
   in the further pathologizing of (non)-responsive government. This essay
   proposes critical realism (CR) as a heuristic for conceptualizing unique
   contributions of news media to backsliding. Reality consists of layered
   strata in CR. This approach accepts the premise of news as a social
   construction but maintains that a domain of reality exists independent
   of discursive representation, and that this realm can be actualized in
   ways that are damaging to democracy. Applied to political communication,
   the domain of the real includes democratic deficits that may or may not
   become actualized depending on how journalism operates at the empirical
   level. Critical realism also generates insights applicable to reform. CR
   insists that journalists avoid reifying sentiment in ways that comfort
   authoritarians. The diagnostic acknowledges the journalistic conviction
   that an external reality is knowable, positing nevertheless that the
   news interacts with underlying social forces. The profession must forge
   a healthier relationship with the public to avoid reifying audience
   support for anti-democratic norms. Reflexivity could be directed beyond
   the recognition of complicity to two productive rationales for
   safeguarding democracy: liberal multiculturalism and journalistic
   paternalism. A final section offers a framework for future research in
   tracing linkages between journalistic practice and backsliding.},

Title = {How Ready Are Indian Primary School Children for English Medium
   Instruction? An Analysis of the Relationship between the Reading Skills
   of Low-SES Children, Their Oral Vocabulary and English Input in the
   Classroom in Government Schools in India},
Journal = {APPLIED LINGUISTICS},
Abstract = {The aim of the study was to find out to what extent low socio-economic
   status (SES) children enrolled in government-run primary schools in
   Hyderabad are ready to receive instruction through the medium of English
   (English medium instruction {[}EMI]). To this end we investigated
   children's oral vocabulary skills, the lexical complexity of their
   textbooks, as well as the amount of English input they receive in class.
   A subsample of 90 children from primary school Grades 4 and 5 who opted
   to carry out a story retelling task in English rather than in Telugu
   took part in the study. Results reveal that the children's oral
   vocabulary levels are far below the levels required to read the textbook
   materials. The lexical diversity of the children's stories as analysed
   with the Index of Guiraud was also a significant predictor of their
   reading comprehension scores. We conclude that children from low-SES
   enrolled in government schools are not ready for EMI, and call for
   further investigation into the levels of English vocabulary knowledge
   that are needed for EMI.},

Abstract = {As the United States has become increasingly polarized, policymakers
   have had difficulty gaining bipartisan support for policy proposals.
   Political polarization can lead to the othering of individuals, a
   process characterized by the tendency to construct members of an
   opposing party in negative ways. In this article, we examine the
   creation and disruption of othering through the lens of language
   convergence/meaning divergence (LC/MD) and pragmatic ambiguity. LC/MD
   and pragmatic ambiguity framed our case study of the successful
   bipartisan passage of the . We found that othering was produced through
   a maestro Discourse of Polarization that structured interactions between
   other Discourses, including the Discourse of National Security and the
   Global Good Discourse. Discordant framings of the three Discourses
   created the ambiguity necessary to disrupt othering and achieve
   collective action. The findings provide new theoretical insights into
   othering processes while pragmatic ambiguity broadens LC/MD in important
   ways.},

Title = {Ethnic Bias in Judicial Decision Making: Evidence from Criminal Appeals
   in Kenya},
Journal = {AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},
Abstract = {Understanding sources of judicial bias is essential for establishing due
   process. To date, theories of judicial decision making are rooted in
   ranked societies with majority-minority group cleavages, leaving
   unanswered which groups are more prone to express bias and whether it is
   motivated by in-group favoritism or out-group hostility. We examine
   judicial bias in Kenya, a diverse society that features a more complex
   ethnic landscape. While research in comparative and African politics
   emphasizes instrumental motivations underpinning ethnic identity, we
   examine the psychological, implicit biases driving judicial outcomes.
   Using data from Kenyan criminal appeals and the conditional random
   assignment of judges to cases, we show that judges are 3 to 5 percentage
   points more likely to grant coethnic appeals than non-coethnic appeals.
   To understand mechanisms, we use word embeddings to analyze the
   sentiment of written judgments. Judges use more trust-related terms
   writing for coethnics, suggesting that in-group favoritism motivates
   coethnic bias in this context.},

Abstract = {The current study takes a bidialectal perspective for the
   conceptualization of pragmatic competence and its development through
   illuminating the need for the field to move forward and overcome the
   standard language ideology in research on L2 pragmatic competence. To
   this end, it brings bidialectal practices to the forefront to
   investigate L2 Arabic pragmatic development in a short-term study abroad
   programme. In particular, bidialectal practices, or the ability to use
   one or more spoken varieties alongside Modern Standard Arabic, are
   explored in this study in relation to appropriateness and pragmatic
   strategies in the production of apologies, refusals, and requests. A
   spoken discourse completion task that included scenarios with varied
   power and social distance combinations were utilized to collect data
   from 36 participants (21 L2 Arabic learners and 15 L1 Arabic speakers)
   in an eight-week study abroad sojourn. Findings indicated an overall
   improvement of pragmatic competence over the period of eight weeks.
   Specifically, significant developments were demonstrated in
   appropriateness scores and learners' use of bidialectal practices in
   pragmatic strategies. Moreover, the qualitative analysis of strategies
   development identified areas in which learners converged towards or
   diverged from L1 speaker norms. Methodologically, the study shows that
   utilizing bidialectal practices to measure L2 Arabic pragmatic
   competence development is key to understanding learners' developmental
   trajectories.},

Journal = {APPLIED LINGUISTICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {43},
Number = {1},
Pages = {65-87},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {In this article, the central argument is that research on the semiotic
   repertoire should also focus on how repertoires are racialized, and race
   is evoked through the semiotic repertoire. The article uses data from
   the South African educational context to advance a position in which
   semiotic repertoires simultaneously give and restrict access, evoke
   evaluation and construct identities in particular ways because of their
   entanglement with (racialized) bodies. I propose that this simultaneity
   can be theorized by viewing the black body as `intercorporeal' and
   `grotesque' (Bakhtin 1984). By drawing on such an approach, processes of
   racialization are explicitly connected to how semiotic resources are
   evoked in discourse. This article thus theoretically contributes to the
   recent movements in applied linguistics that view language as embodied,
   re-examine repertoires, and view language as multiplex and entangled. In
   addition, it also offers a framing that can theoretically challenge
   discourses of post-racialism with its multilayered account of how race
   continues to be experienced as a significant form of meaning-making.},

Abstract = {How do political actors forge social solidarity across preexisting axes
   of social difference? This article investigates how political elites
   undertaking projects of political articulation-understood as linking
   together diverse constituencies to create integrated political
   blocs-contend with preexisting cultural constraints embedded in the
   social fabric. I do so by tracing how the post-1959 Cuban regime
   attempted to build a population-wide revolutionary identity despite
   persisting cultural understandings of women primarily as apolitical
   housewives. Through systematic analysis of a large corpus of state
   discourse in the form of speeches and women's magazines, I show how
   regime leaders negotiated, with varying degrees of success over time,
   the cultural constraints that gender posed to their unifying project.
   Ultimately, the regime's initiatives to politicize women through
   including them in mass campaigns and radicalizing their traditional
   household tasks were relatively successful, but cultural backlash
   against women's increasing presence in the labor force prompted the
   institutionalization of a gendered division of labor in the economy that
   traditionalized their initially radical entry into the workplace.
   Analyzing how political elites confront and manage social differences
   within political blocs promises to contribute to a better understanding
   of the political production of social solidarity and its downstream
   effects on categorical inequalities.},

Title = {Human Rights Violations in Space: Assessing the External Validity of
   Machine-Geocoded versus Human-Geocoded Data},
Journal = {POLITICAL ANALYSIS},
Abstract = {Political event data are widely used in studies of political violence.
   Recent years have seen notable advances in the automated coding of
   political event data from international news sources. Yet, the validity
   of machine-coded event data remains disputed, especially in the context
   of event geolocation. We analyze the frequencies of human- and
   machine-geocoded event data agreement in relation to an independent
   (ground truth) source. The events are human rights violations in
   Colombia. We perform our evaluation for a key, 8-year period of the
   Colombian conflict and in three 2-year subperiods as well as for a
   selected set of (non)journalistically remote municipalities. As a
   complement to this analysis, we estimate spatial probit models based on
   the three datasets. These models assume Gaussian Markov Random Field
   error processes; they are constructed using a stochastic partial
   differential equation and estimated with integrated nested Laplacian
   approximation. The estimated models tell us whether the three datasets
   produce comparable predictions, underreport events in relation to the
   same covariates, and have similar patterns of prediction error. Together
   the two analyses show that, for this subnational conflict, the machine-
   and human-geocoded datasets are comparable in terms of external validity
   but, according to the geostatistical models, produce prediction errors
   that differ in important respects.},

Abstract = {How does an authoritarian regime cover news about foreign countries for
   its domestic audience? What accounts for the variation in news coverage
   received by different foreign countries? While existing literature
   points to political concerns at home, in this article, we argue that a
   regime's economic interests can also be a driving force: the desire to
   deepen its international economic engagement can motivate the regime to
   treat foreign countries differently in its news coverage. To test this
   argument, we examine foreign news coverage by China's state-run
   television network between 2003 and 2018. Combining textual and
   quantitative analysis, we find that countries with stronger economic
   ties with China receive more favorable news coverage. Moreover, the
   manipulation of coverage favorability is achieved through selective
   reporting: negative events such as armed conflicts receive less coverage
   when taking place in a country with close economic ties with China.
   These findings contribute to our understanding of international news
   flow, especially in a non-Western setting. They also demonstrate a
   pragmatic rather than political use of information control by an
   authoritarian government.},

Title = {Representative Democracy and Colonial Inspirations: The Case of John
   Stuart Mill},
Journal = {AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},
Abstract = {Focusing on John Stuart Mill, a particularly illuminating contributor to
   modern democratic theory, this article examines the connections between
   modern democracy and the European colonial experience. It argues that
   Mill drew on the exclusionary logic and discourse available through the
   colonial experience to present significant portions of the English
   working classes as domestic barbarians, whose potential rise to power
   posed a danger to civilization itself: a line of argument that helped
   him legitimate representative government as a democratic, rather than an
   antidemocratic form of government, as it had been traditionally
   perceived. The article contributes to our understanding of the
   development of modern democratic theory and practice by drawing
   attention to the ways the colonial experience shaped core Western
   institutions and ways of thinking, and it makes the case that this
   experience remains an essential, if often unacknowledged, part of our
   collective ``self.{''}},

Abstract = {Partisanship in American politics is inextricably linked with social
   identities, and sentiments toward party-aligned groups affect political
   orientations. However, out-group animosity may operate differently
   depending on the party or elite. We investigate the extent to which
   citizens' animus toward (Democratically aligned) minority groups drove
   political support for Donald Trump, whose incendiary rhetoric regarding
   such groups is unique in modern presidential politics. Leveraging panel
   data beginning before Trump's candidacy, we find that animus toward
   Democratic-linked groups in 2011 predicts future support for Trump
   regardless of party identity. This animus does not predict future
   support for other Republican or Democratic politicians or either party.
   Nor do we find that animus toward Republican groups predicts support for
   Democratic elites. Trump's support is thus uniquely tied to animus
   toward minority groups. Our findings provide insights into the social
   divisions underlying American politics and the role of elite rhetoric in
   translating animus into political support.},

Abstract = {This article involves the work of four language educators/researchers
   collaborating on an ongoing longitudinal multilingual participatory
   action research (PAR) project in a Bachelor of Arts (BA) language
   teaching program in Oaxaca, Mexico. Overall, this PAR project aims at
   the co-construction of social justice in ELT in Mexico. In particular,
   it explores an approach that would encourage learners to make full(er)
   use of their language resources to challenge the colonial othering
   discourses of inferiority, disability, and backwardness inherent in ELT
   in Mexico. The analyses reported in this article zooms in on the English
   learning experiences of three Indigenous background, low-socioeconomic
   status, female undergraduate students, and their alleged struggle with
   speaking English in teaching-learning and assessment activities. The
   purpose of this article is to illustrate how a local English teacher
   co-constructed social justice with these three students. To fulfill this
   purpose, we succinctly present the focal students life stories and
   address three emergent themes: (i) unveiling alienating practices in the
   classroom; (ii) carving out spaces for multilingualism in the English
   classroom; and (iii) authoring assessment as a way to enact social

   pages. Assuming a simple model of tag assignment, we estimate the

   recovered scale can be interpreted in familiar terms of ``left versus

   parties' positions from extant large-scale expert surveys, most strongly
   with ratings of general left-right ideology. Party position estimates
   also show high stability in a test-retest scenario. Our results
   demonstrate that a Wikipedia-based approach yields valid and reliable
   left-right scores comparable to scores obtained via conventional expert
   coding methods. It thus provides a measure with potentially unlimited
   party coverage. Our measurement strategy is also applicable beyond

Abstract = {This study explores the longitudinal pathway of social identification
   traveled by a US learner of Chinese, Tom. Focusing on the historical
   production of persons, I analyze interactional recordings, instructional
   artifacts, and participant interviews collected over three years of
   qualitative inquiry. The analysis articulates how Tom's narrative of
   intercultural encounters was reframed, rekeyed, and recycled at home and
   abroad. Along the way, Tom was identified as (i) an avid learner of
   Chinese in a language classroom in the USA; (ii) an ignorant foreigner
   while studying in China; and (iii) a political outcast upon his return
   to the USA whose intercultural experience abroad, nevertheless, afforded
   his classmates an opportunity to appreciate a more ethno-relative
   perspective. The consonance and dissonance of identification are results
   of interplay between history in person and history in institutionalized
   struggles. This interplay must be considered to understand the
   (re)making of language-learning identities across historical time,
   social space, and communicative modes. The findings illustrate how
   history, social identification, and engagement in intercultural
   communication mutually inform each other in and beyond transnational
   mobility.},

Abstract = {Due to their potential influence on the individual and societal
   formation of opinions, the quality of online discussions has been a
   subject of widespread interest. From a deliberative perspective,
   rational argumentation and critical reflection are central criteria for
   good discourse. Drawing on research on the perception of arguments and
   the conditions of disagreement, we ask how argument strength is linked
   to the likelihood of receiving (reasoned) disagreement and whether the
   discussion norms and technical features set by the news organizations
   moderate this effect. Based on a manual content analysis of 14.690 user
   comments on nine German news websites, we find that comments with a
   higher argument strength are more likely to receive disagreement in
   general and reasoned disagreement in particular. Further, the levels of
   (reasoned) disagreement are higher on platforms with strong discussion
   norms and supporting technical features. The results show that the
   quality of a discussion can be related to both users' argumentation and
   the decisions of the news organizations.},

Abstract = {To address racial inequity and the exclusion of African Americans in
   applied linguistics, second-language acquisition, and world language
   (WL) education, our field must reckon with social justice problems of

   theory (CRT) and critical race pedagogy (CRP) elucidate how such
   injustices are perpetuated, plus, propose solutions for them. This
   article discusses racism and anti-Blackness in WL curriculum, materials,
   and instructional practices. It presents a post-hoc CRT analysis of
   findings from two studies: (i) an ethnographic study examining Spanish
   curriculum and instructional practices at two minority serving
   postsecondary institutions and (ii) a participatory action research
   collaboration with Spanish instructors examining curriculum at a
   predominantly white institution-both studies linked by how they reveal
   endemic racism and anti-Blackness in WL programmes. Ultimately, this
   article addresses how African Americans can more authentically and
   successfully participate in WL programmes. It introduces to the field a
   proposal of CRP for more effective WL teaching to promote practices in
   antiracism, equity-mindedness, and inclusivity for greater retention and

Abstract = {What drives organizational nonconformity to global corporate governance
   norms? Despite the prevalence of such norms and attendant conformity
   pressures, many firms do not adhere to them. We build on a political
   view of corporate governance to explore how different national
   institutional contexts and organizational conditions combine to produce
   over- and underconformity to global board independence norms. Using
   configurational analyses and data from banks in OECD countries, we
   identify multiple equifinal combinations of conditions associated with
   over- and underconformity. We also find that over- and underconformity
   have different drivers. We conjecture that while overconformity is
   associated with a shareholder-management coalition in liberal market
   economies, underconformity results from multiple complex combinations of
   national and organizational conditions that often include dominant
   blockholders, strong labor rights, and small organizational size. We
   leverage these findings to abduct theoretical insights on nonconformity
   to global corporate governance norms. Doing so sheds light on the role
   of power in conditioning the adoption of global practices and
   contributes to research on international corporate governance by
   informing discourse surrounding the globalization of markets.},

   racialized occupational hierarchies in Brazil. We seek to locate these
   meanings in the interpretative frames provided by the experiences of two
   Black, first-generation university students, which we connect to
   dehumanizing histories of labor relations and narrow textbook
   representations. The findings suggest that Brazilian ELT, through its
   reliance on global textbooks, presents interactional scenarios that are
   often the site of racial humiliation. Following Grosfoguel and Sousa
   Santos' conceptualization of racial oppression, we identify racialized
   orders of being as an analytical category that allows for connections to
   be made between political economy and language education, including as
   part of anti-racist pedagogical efforts.},

Title = {Transfiguring Theaters for Disrespectable Leisure: An Ethnography on
   Black Womxn's Ratchet Performances in Movie Showings of Girls Trip},

Abstract = {This ethnographic study considers how Black womxn audiences collectively
   negotiated the politics of respectability in the movie theater,
   anecdotally referred to as cinema etiquette, in showings of the film
   Girls Trip. Data were collected in two local theaters in a Northeastern
   city using field interviews, follow-up telephone interviews, and
   participant observation. Findings revealed that Black womxn audiences
   (from various age groups) embodied an intersectional resistance
   discourse of disrespectability ( Cooper, 2012, 2017, 2018) through their
   (non)verbal behaviors and an ecology of the senses (i.e., sight and
   sound) that were situated at the intersection of ratchetness,
   playfulness, and informality. In doing so, they created a
   ``homeplace,{''} making an otherwise uncomfortable and highly regulated
   public space suitable for their collective spectatorship of the film. We
   argue that Black womxn's embodiment of ratchetness is not necessarily a
   unidimensional endeavor, but rather an ever-evolving, multifaceted
   resource that enables Black womxn to reach political and pleasurable
   ends.},

Title = {When Issue Salience Affects Adjudication: Evidence from Swiss Asylum
   Appeal Decisions},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Abstract = {Immigration is a top concern among citizens across the globe. Research
   shows that the salience of immigration shapes voters' political
   behavior, but little is known about whether it influences judicial
   behavior. This article theorizes that variation in issue salience
   influences judges' behavior when there is a clear connection between the
   legal and a generally salient, politicized issue. I test this argument
   drawing on all Swiss asylum appeal decisions reached between 2007 and
   2015. I find that higher asylum salience leads judges to decide
   otherwise similar asylum appeals less favorably. This effect is not
   restricted to judges affiliated with anti-immigrant parties, unlikely to
   be driven by accountability pressures, and strongest for those topics
   known to drive anti-immigrant sentiment in the general public. Together,
   these findings raise concerns that issue salience threatens the
   consistency of judicial decisions.},

Abstract = {Changing demography in the Southwest USA has shifted the racial
   compositions of many neighborhoods that were once predominantly African
   American to majority Latinx immigrant communities (Orfield and
   Frankenberg 2014). Today, it's common for these two youth communities to
   learn side-by-side in urban and suburban classrooms where they are often
   positioned to share each other's cultural practices (Martinez 2017).
   However, language and literacy research often positions these two
   minoritized communities as mutually exclusive (Paris 2010). Moreover,
   while researchers have urged the analysis of these two youth communities
   comparatively few studies document classroom units that cultivate spaces
   for `linguistic solidarity' (Martinez 2017). Drawing from an
   ethnographic study of an 11th-grade ethnic studies class, the authors
   explore how Arturo (third author) took up a critical translingual
   approach in his classroom where students-both Latinx and African
   American-collaborated through the cowriting of corridos (Mexican
   ballads) about their lived experiences with in/justice. The findings
   demonstrate the ways that this unit invited students to write across
   racial, ethnic, and linguistic borders and fostered language and
   cultural sharing, political consciousness, and solidarity.},

Abstract = {Audiences' engagement with mediated messages lies at the center of media
   effects research. However, the neurocognitive components underlying
   audience engagement remain unclear. A neuroimaging study was conducted
   to determine whether personal narratives engage the brains of audience
   members more than non-narrative messages and to investigate the brain
   regions that facilitate this effect. Intersubject correlations of brain
   activity during message exposure showed that listening to personal
   narratives elicited strong audience engagement as evidenced by robust
   correlations across participants' frontal and parietal lobes compared to
   a nonpersonal control text and a reversed language control stimulus.
   Thus, personal narratives were received and processed more consistently
   and reliably within specific brain regions. The findings contribute
   toward a biologically informed explanation for how personal narratives
   engage audiences to convey information.},

   Lexical competence is fundamental for communicative purposes in a given

   language proficiency assessment. Although many people study Italian as
   second language (L2), an easy-to-use vocabulary test to measure lexical
   proficiency is still missing. In this work, we aim to fill this gap by
   presenting LexITA, which is an objective, reliable, and quick assessment
   of Italian receptive vocabulary. LextITA was validated on students of
   Italian L2 and showed to be a valid measure to assess vocabulary
   knowledge of L2 speakers spanning different levels of proficiency.},

Abstract = {The recent shift in the field of applied language studies has shown that

   aimed to find out students' perceptions about the use of translanguaging

   African medical students at a South African university who participated
   in a focus group discussion. The focus group discussion aimed to find
   out if the use of translanguaging enhances students' comprehension of
   texts. Participants affirm that with translanguaging, understanding of
   difficult academic concepts in English can be enhanced. Findings from
   this study prompt me to assert that multilingualism is a useful asset
   that can be leveraged by using translanguaging in multilingual
   classrooms to enhance reading comprehension. What is required is for
   lecturers to tap into students' linguistic resources to enhance their
   understanding of concepts.},

Abstract = {We employ a regression discontinuity design leveraging close school

   student achievement. We find some evidence that increases in minority
   representation lead to cumulative achievement gains of approximately 0.1
   standard deviations among minority students by the sixth post-election
   year. These gains do not come at the expense of white students' academic
   performance, which also appears to improve. Turning to the policy
   mechanisms that may explain these effects, we find that an increase in
   minority representation leads to greater capital funding and a larger
   proportion of district principals who are non-white. We find no
   significant effects of minority representation on school segregation,
   the reclassification of English language learners, or teacher staffing.},

Year = {2021},
Volume = {115},
Number = {1},
Pages = {14-30},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {As government welfare programming contracts and NGOs increasingly assume
   core aid functions, they must address a long-standing challenge-that
   people in need often belong to stigmatized groups. To study
   other-regarding behavior, we fielded an experiment through a
   text-to-give campaign in Greece. Donations did not increase with an
   appeal to the in-group (Greek child) relative to a control (child), but
   they were halved with reference to a stigmatized out-group (Roma child).
   An appeal to fundamental rights, a common advocacy strategy, did not
   reduce the generosity gap. Donations to all groups were lower near Roma
   communities and declined disproportionately for the Roma appeal.
   Qualitative research in 12 communities complements our experiment. We
   conclude that NGO fundraising strategies that narrowly emphasize either
   in-groups or out-groups, or fundamental rights language, may not be as
   effective as broader appeals, and we discuss implications for public
   goods provision in an era of growing nationalism.},

   31 Chinese scientists seeking to publish in English, following their
   writing practices and use of discursive support by colleagues. We found
   that colleagues, although a valuable resource, were at best part of the
   solution. Many also turned to noncolleague text mediators, but with only
   limited success. Our study points to the need that institutions in
   non-Anglophone settings may need to sponsor systematic support to their
   scholars striving for international publication.},

Abstract = {In this article, I argue for a chronotopic-scalar system of images and
   resolutions in the analysis of language use in general and multilingual
   practices in particular. Drawing on data from Iranian Azerbaijanis, I
   argue that availability and accessibility of linguistic/semiotic
   resources, and their categorizations as languages or language varieties,
   are constrained by participants' chronotopization histories. That is,
   the scaled images participants develop through socialization about
   different time-space frames and the peoples, relations, discourses, and
   resources therein guide their language use both from and about
   particular contexts. I discuss the utility of spatiotemporal
   understandings of repertoires of resources and normalcies in capturing
   the variability, dynamicity, and complexity of semiotic practices and
   also in addressing the controversies among scholars regarding the
   `realness' of languages and hybridity of multilingual practices. Through
   decentralizing language(s) and foregrounding context(s) and
   contextualization, I argue, the chronotope enables us to analyze not
   only social actors' hybrid utilization of semiotic resources in
   meaning-making processes, but also their language ideologies and
   language-ideological practices, which rely heavily on the perceptions of
   languages as discrete systems.},

Abstract = {The reciprocal nature of spoken interaction means that participants
   constantly alternate between speaker and listener roles. However,
   listener or recipient actions-also known as interactive listening
   (IL)-are somewhat underrepresented in language tests. In conventional
   listening tests, they are not directly assessed. In speaking tests, they
   have often been overshadowed by an emphasis on production features or
   subsumed under broader constructs such as interactional competence. This
   article is an effort to represent the rich IL phenomena that can be
   found in peer interactive speaking assessments, where the
   candidate-candidate format and discussion task offer opportunities to
   elicit and assess IL. Taking a close look at candidate discourse and
   nonverbal actions through a conversation analytic approach, the analysis
   focuses on three IL features (i) listenership displays, (ii) contingent
   responses, and (iii) collaborative completions, and unpacks their
   relative strength in evidencing listener understanding. This article
   concludes by making a case for revisiting the role of IL, calling for
   more explicit inclusion of IL in L2 assessment as well as pedagogy.},

Abstract = {Early research on wartime violence against civilians highlighted a
   distinction between macro- and micro-level approaches. Macro-level
   approaches, grounded in the international relations subfield, focus on
   variation across countries or conflicts, while micro-level approaches,
   more influenced by the comparative politics subfield, focus on variation
   within countries or conflicts. However, some of the recent research on
   civilian targeting does not fit neatly into this dichotomy-such as
   research comparing subnational units or armed groups across conflicts or
   research relying on geo-referenced event data for multiple conflicts. We
   review the literature and advocate moving beyond the language of the
   micro- and macro-level divide, instead focusing on the determinants of
   violence against civilians at five different levels of analysis:
   international, domestic, subnational, organizational, and individual.
   While acknowledging significant advances in the field, we argue for
   continued research aimed at developing a more integrated theoretical
   understanding of the multiple actors and interactive social processes
   driving violence against civilians.},

Pages = {109-129},
Abstract = {Socialization is a key mechanism of social reproduction. Yet, like the
   functionalists who introduced the concept, socialization has fallen out
   of favor, critiqued for ignoring power and agency, for its teleology and
   incoherence, and for a misguided link to ``culture of poverty{''}
   arguments. In this review, we argue for a renewed, postfunctionalist use
   of socialization. We review the concept's history, its high point under
   Parsons, the reasons for its demise, its continued use in some subfields
   (e.g., gender, race and ethnicity, education), and alternative concepts
   used to explain social reproduction. We then suggest that something is
   lost when socialization is avoided or isolated in particular subfields.
   Without socialization, conceptions of social reproduction face problems
   of history, power, and transferability. We close by outlining a
   postfunctionalist agenda for socialization research, providing a
   framework for a new theory of socialization, one that builds off of
   cognitive science, pragmatism, the study of language, the
   reinterrogation of values, and the development of ideology in political
   socialization.},

Abstract = {Past studies examined the prevalence of strategy framing in news
   coverage and its effects on cynicism, knowledge, and content evaluation.
   Missing from the literature is an examination of the relationship
   between strategy framing in news and electoral success, the actual goal
   of political campaigns. Similarly, factors that shape media use of
   strategy framing on the candidate and race levels were rarely examined.
   We argue that these gaps in knowledge are due to taxing coding
   procedures required for systematic estimation of strategy framing in
   large corpora. We use a recently developed unsupervised computational
   method (ANTMN) to automatically code the news coverage of 312 U.S.
   Senate candidates in 156 races between 2008 and 2016 in a corpus of
   181,725 articles. We found that strategy framing is negatively
   associated with electoral success. Strategy-oriented news coverage is
   associated with the competitiveness of the race; candidates' experience;
   and for Democratic candidates only, the conservativeness of the state.},

Abstract = {This article argues that human-animal relationships are a key conceptual
   terrain for applied linguists to intervene in emerging interdisciplinary
   debates on how to address problematic human-environment relations in a
   time of growing ecological degradation. The scientific diagnosis of the
   Anthropocene has further generated critical discussion in the social
   sciences on the need to understand the diversity of local cultural
   responses to global environmental crises, ranging from climate change to
   species extinction. This article proposes that a `green applied
   linguistics' can offer empirical insights into the role of language and
   discourse in mediating diverse human relationships with animals and
   nature. Taking human interactions with protected wildlife as one aspect
   of these wider socio-environmental debates, this article builds on
   recent embodied, materialist and posthumanist research in applied
   linguistics to suggest that nexus analysis offers a holistic methodology
   to examine the problematic ways people become caught up with threatened
   species through their semiotic practices. I illustrate these ideas
   through examples from my ethnographic research on the convergence of sea
   turtle conservation and ecotourism practices at Laniakea Beach, Hawai'i.},

Abstract = {Wedges and frames, two much-studied strategies of American political
   combat, are generally thought to be partisan weapons, meant to
   manipulate voters into making trade-offs that favor the political actor
   wielding them. My inquiry here explores whether there exists anything
   comparably schematic to wedges and frames at work in attempts by
   American politicians not to polarize but to find consensus, not to cater
   to extremes but moderate them. Despite the seeming paucity of such
   efforts in American public discourse, there is one such common and
   as-yet untheorized scheme, which uses the two issue positions involved
   in wedges to overcome the ill effects of reframing and the two value
   dimensions involved in reframing to overcome the ill effects of wedges.
   I elaborate this discursive structure by examining its presence in a
   number of American political debates, showing how it differs from other
   contemporary normative-theoretic frameworks for understanding compromise

Abstract = {Rather than exhibiting bias or open-minded reasoning at baseline, we
   argue that information processing is motivated by whatever goals a
   context makes salient. Thus, if politics feels like debate, people will
   be motivated to argue for their side. If politics feels like
   deliberation, they will be motivated to seek consensus through
   open-minded processing. Results from three experiments demonstrate: (1)
   Politics evokes thoughts similar to conflictual contexts and dissimilar
   from deliberative contexts. (2) Consequently, information labeled
   ``political{''} primes the motivation to counterargue, leading to
   opinion polarization. Absent such labeling, no such motivation is
   evident, explaining why bias is common but not inherent to politics. (3)
   Despite this capacity for bias, people can be motivated to actively
   process and accept counterattitudinal information by simply making the
   value of open-mindedness salient. This suggests open-minded discourse is
   possible even absent motivation to evaluate information accurately. We
   conclude by discussing the implications of our research for political
   discourse.},

Abstract = {Many researchers consider the presentation of diverse content as a
   prerequisite for the news media to fully exercise their democratic
   mandate. While prior news diversity studies have contributed important
   theoretical insights, we argue here that scholarly knowledge of this
   concept can be significantly advanced by employing computational methods
   for text analysis. Using automated methods, researchers can increase
   both the scope of data being analyzed and the resolution of the
   analysis. This article presents a novel framework for analyzing news
   diversity consisting of two distinct stages. In the first stage, a
   computational text classification method is used to analyze, at a high
   resolution, the attention given in news texts to a broad range of
   political and social issues. In the second stage, the text
   classifications are aggregated, and the distributions of media attention
   to those issues (i.e., news diversity) are assessed on a large scale.
   After presenting the novel approach, we illustrate its usefulness for
   testing theoretical hypotheses about news diversity. We compare the
   diversity of economic coverage in three elite and three popular US
   newspapers (N= 252,807 articles) and find that a fine-grained analysis
   relaxes concerns raised in previous studies about low content diversity
   in the popular press.},

Abstract = {This investigation responds to the need for longitudinal data-driven
   research on additional-language (AL) acquisition by examining
   grammatical-gender marking among AL learners of French during a 21-month
   period, which included an academic year abroad (LANGSNAP corpus). The
   analysis of oral production consists of a generalized linear mixed model
   that examines a range of linguistic and extralinguistic factors shown to
   be important for gender marking in previous research, as well as a
   random effect for participant. Results show evidence of both change
   across time and consistency in the interlanguage. Drawing on
   variationism and usage-based approaches, we argue that longitudinal
   investigations that are focused on how learners use their additional
   language have much to offer our understanding of AL acquisition
   processes.},

Abstract = {RT (formerly, Russia Today) is one of the most important organizations
   in the global political economy of disinformation. It is the most richly
   funded, well-staffed, formal organization in the world producing,
   disseminating, and marketing news in the service of the Kremlin. It is
   an agency accused of many things, but little is known about all the
   creative work involved in financing, governing, training, and motivating
   RT's activities. To understand more about the production of political
   news and information by RT, we investigate its organizational behavior
   through in-depth interviews of current and former staff. Our data show
   that RT is an opportunist channel that is used as an instrument of state
   defense policy to meddle in the politics of other states. The channel
   has been established in the shadows of the Soviet media system and its
   organizational behavior is characterized by Soviet-style controls.},

Abstract = {Censorship has traditionally been understood as a way for dictators to
   silence opposition. By contrast, this article develops and tests the
   theory that certain forms of censorship-in particular, prohibitions on
   popular culture-serve not only to limit political information but also
   to reward dictators' supporters. Using text analysis of all 8,000 films
   reviewed for distribution during Chile's dictatorship, I demonstrate
   that rather than focusing only on sensitive political topics, censors
   banned movies containing content considered immoral. Through a
   combination of qualitative and quantitative evidence, I show that these
   patterns cannot be explained by masked political content, distributor
   self-censorship, or censor preferences. Instead, they reflect the
   regime's use of censorship as a reward for supporters, particularly
   conservative Catholic groups. My findings suggest that even repressive
   measures can be used in part to maintain support for authoritarian
   regimes.},

Abstract = {This study explores the overall nature of the vocabulary knowledge
   construct by examining the relationships and order of acquisition of
   multiple word knowledge components. A total of 144 Spanish learners of
   English were tested on their recognition and recall knowledge of four
   word knowledge components: the form-meaning link, derivatives, multiple
   meanings, and collocations. All word knowledge components were strongly
   intercorrelated, and implicational scaling analyses showed that there is
   a consistent pattern of acquisition for these components, with
   recognition knowledge being acquired before recall knowledge across all
   the different components. Structural equation modelling (SEM) revealed
   that all components (both recognition and recall) contribute
   significantly to the global vocabulary construct. However, SEM also
   suggested that the recognition and recall masteries of any particular
   word knowledge component must be seen as separate constructs. Overall,
   findings suggest that the distinction between recognition and recall
   knowledge is fundamental to the conceptualization of the development of
   vocabulary knowledge.},

Abstract = {We consider evidence for the assertion that backbench members of

   the area, which are ultimately ambiguous on this question. We then
   provide a new statistical model of distinctiveness that extends
   traditional efforts to statistically characterize the ``style{''} of
   authors and apply it to a corpus of Hansard speeches from 1935 to 2018.
   In the aggregate, we find no evidence for the claim of more homogeneity.
   But this hides intriguing covariate effects: at the MP-level, panel
   regression results demonstrate that on average, more senior backbenchers
   tend to be less ``different{''} in speech terms. We also show, however,
   that this pattern is changing: in recent times, it is more experienced
   MPs who speak most distinctively.},

Title = {Do Gender Cues from Images Supersede Partisan Cues Conveyed via Text?
   Eye Movements Reveal Political Stereotyping in Multimodal Information
   Environments},
Journal = {POLITICAL COMMUNICATION},

Volume = {38},

Month = {MAY 4},
Abstract = {An important feature of the information environment is its multimodal
   nature. In politics, people encounter representations of political
   candidates that combine images and text. Among the most prominent pieces
   of information people encounter are a candidate's gender, obtained from
   images of the candidate's face, and the candidate's partisan
   identification, often represented as text. This feature of the
   environment is important given previous work showing that individuals
   infer gender categories from faces rapidly and effortlessly. In this
   study (N = 113), we use eye movements to determine how individuals
   assign stereotypical policy positions to candidates in an environment in
   which photos of candidates' faces are paired with labels of their
   partisan IDs. We find that politically-knowledgeable individuals are
   more likely to use partisan- than gender-based stereotypes. In contrast,
   political novices did not prioritize one type of stereotype over the
   other. Our findings have implications for understanding how individuals
   make political evaluations in multimodal settings and show the
   advantages of measuring eye movements when studying stereotyping in
   multimodal environments.},

Abstract = {We put forward a new approach to studying issue definition within the
   context of policy diffusion. Most studies of policy diffusion-which is
   the process by which policymaking in one government affects policymaking
   in other governments-have focused on policy adoptions. We shift the
   focus to an important but neglected aspect of this process: the
   issue-definition stage. We use topic models to estimate how policies are
   framed during this stage and how these frames are predicted by prior
   policy adoptions. Focusing on smoking restriction in U.S. states, our
   analysis draws upon an original data set of over 52,000 paragraphs from
   newspapers covering 49 states between 1996 and 2013. We find that frames
   regarding the policy's concrete implications are predicted by prior
   adoptions in other states, whereas frames regarding its normative
   justifications are not. Our approach and findings open the way for a new
   perspective to studying policy diffusion in many different areas.},

Abstract = {Concerns are raised repeatedly about the uncivil and simplistic way in
   which politicians often express their ideas. This political
   communication style runs counter to deliberative democratic virtues such
   as respectful interactions and well-justified arguments. Its use is
   therefore problematic from a normative point of view, yet there are
   indications that it is an effective communication style to persuade
   citizens. Two survey experiments - text and audio - were developed to
   investigate the effects of uncivil communication and simplistic
   argumentation on political trust and on persuasive power in political
   election debates. The results show that 1) uncivil communication lowers
   political trust and is slightly less convincing than civil
   communication, 2) simplistic argumentation, i.e. political arguments
   presented in ill- or non-justified ways, does not affect political trust
   and is not more persuasive than well-justified argumentation, and 3) the
   strongest violation of social norms, i.e. a combined use of uncivil
   communication and simplistic argumentation, decreases both trust in the
   political candidate and persuasive power. Interestingly, politically
   cynical citizens and citizens who do not value inclusionary debates
   react differently to uncivil communication and simplistic argumentation:
   their level of trust does not decline and they are persuaded slightly
   more by simplistic arguments expressed in uncivil ways.},

Abstract = {Checkpoints in the West Bank's Hebron Governorate represent Israel's
   ever-present power over Palestinian civilians. Drawing on 71 interviews
   conducted during the Intifada of Individuals (2015), this article
   inductively builds theory about the relationship between social
   isolation and different modalities of resistance. Rather than forcing
   civilians to comply with the state, checkpoint apparatus instead change
   the nature and texture of resistance. I suggest that checkpoints
   structure social connections for civilians on the ground. Checkpoint
   apparatus which inhibit social connection engender a feeling of
   hopelessness and foster support for individual, often violent,
   resistance. Where checkpoints isolate a community as a whole but did not
   disrupt within-community social connections, citizens maintain hope for
   the possibility of change, which facilitates a preference for collective
   resistance. This article identifies troubling consequences checkpoints
   have on civilians and highlights how oppressive state power can limit
   some modalities of resistance only to engender support for others.},

Abstract = {This article argues that a new form of globalizing multilingualism,
   which I call `supralingualism', has been afoot since 1990, when the rise
   of algorithmic translation and cross-linguistic information retrieval
   (CLIR) practices set in in earnest in the supply-side logistics
   industries. A political landscape characterized by international
   consensus and compliance in the 1990s (as opposed to tariff wars and
   logistical nationalism) further buttressed this new ideology, leading to
   a newly multilingual centripetality in the global management of meaning.
   Based on historical examples and evidence from computational
   engineering, this article tracks the extraordinary growth of this sector
   and its implications for other arenas of language practice, implications
   that indude: monolingualization, securitization, dehistoricization,
   lexicaliztation, and the reduction of `culture' to its most overt
   linguistic forms.},

Journal = {APPLIED LINGUISTICS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {41},
Number = {1, SI},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Learning a visual language gives hearing mothers the possibility of
   participating in their deaf children's culture. Yet, mothers also
   grapple with the demands of an unmarked global hearing culture,
   especially as their children's deafness becomes mediated by technology
   and medical intervention, under the guise of progress, social mobility,
   equity, and inclusion (Lane et al. 1996). Access to spoken English
   through technological aids supposedly `solves' the perceived `problem'
   of communication and cultural difference between mother and child. But
   what is at stake in this process of translation aided by new
   technologies? I take a critical discourse analytic approach to analyze
   videotaped interviews with six hearing mothers. Hearing mother
   interviewees displayed ambivalent shifts in footing, in particular,
   mode-switches, which, I argue, paralleled the ambiguous subject
   positions of their deaf children who they perceive as both deaf (without
   implants) and hearing (with implants). This study brings to light the
   complex role technology and `cochlear implant culture' play in shaping
   an instrumentalized view of language with the objective of participating
   in local and global hearing culture.},

Abstract = {In the highly multicultural workplace of today's multinational
   corporations (MNCs), translating across different cultures becomes a
   crucial issue. But what precisely counts as culture in the global
   workplace of the MNC? What does it exactly mean to be able to translate
   across cultures under the regimes of evaluation adopted by MNCs? In this
   article, I consider these questions through a discussion of the
   corporate discourse of diversity management, in which the cultural
   diversity of the workforce is understood as a resource for maximizing
   profit. Based on a critical review of diversity management literature
   and a study on Korean managers working for non-Korean MNCs in Singapore,
   I first show how diversity management's claim of openness and
   inclusivity actually works to reproduce unequal relations in the
   workplace. I then argue that attention to the politics of translation,
   where the ideological nature of evaluations of cultural
   (in)commensurability is highlighted, is needed for applied linguists'
   engagement with language and communication in the multicultural
   workplace.},

Year = {2020},
Volume = {53},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {188-196},
Month = {JAN 2},
Abstract = {When people talk, they recruit a wide range of expressive devices for
   interactional work, from sighs, sniffs, clicks, and whistles to other
   conduct that borders on the linguistic. These resources are used in the
   management of turn and sequence and the marking of stance and affect,
   and they represent an aspect of the interactional machinery that is as
   elusive as it is powerful. Phenomena long assumed to be beyond the
   purview of linguistic inquiry emerge as systematically deployed
   practices whose ambiguous degree of control and convention allows
   participants to carry out subtle interactional work without committing
   to specific words. While these resources have been characterized as
   nonlexical, nonverbal, or nonconventional, I propose that they are
   unified in their liminality: They work well precisely because they
   equivocate between sound and speech. The empirical study of liminal
   signs shows the promise of sequential analysis for building a science of
   language on interactional foundations.},

Abstract = {How does parties' use of moral rhetoric affect voter behavior? Prior
   comparative party research has studied party positions without much
   attention to how parties explain and justify their positions. Drawing
   insights from political and moral psychology, I argue that moral
   rhetoric mobilizes copartisan voters by activating positive emotions
   about their partisan preference. I expect this to hold among copartisans
   who are exposed to party rhetoric. To test my argument, I measure moral
   rhetoric by text-analyzing party manifestos from six English-speaking
   democracies and measure mobilization using copartisan turnout in survey
   data. The results support my argument. Furthermore, I find evidence in
   support of the theoretical mechanism using survey experiments and panel
   survey data from Britain. The article shows that moral rhetoric is a
   party campaign frame that has important consequences for voter behavior.},

   effects gradually weaken when using ``truth scales,{''} refuting only
   parts of a claim, and fact-checking campaign-related statements.
   Likewise, the ability to correct political misinformation with
   fact-checking is substantially attenuated by participants' preexisting
   beliefs, ideology, and knowledge. The study concludes with a discussion

Abstract = {Political scientists can rely on a long tradition of applying
   unsupervised measurement models to estimate ideology and preferences
   from texts. However, in practice the hope that the dominant source of
   variation in their data is the quantity of interest is often not
   realized. In this paper, I argue that in the messy world of speeches we
   have to rely on supervised approaches that include information on party
   affiliation in order to produce meaningful estimates of polarization. To
   substantiate this argument, I introduce a validation framework that may
   be used to comparatively assess supervised and unsupervised methods, and
   estimate polarization on the basis of 6.2 million records of
   parliamentary speeches from the UK House of Commons over the period
   1811-2015. Beyond introducing several important adjustments to existing
   estimation approaches, the paper's methodological contribution therefore
   consists of outlining the challenges of applying unsupervised estimation
   techniques to speech data, and arguing in detail why we should instead
   rely on supervised methods to measure polarization.},

Abstract = {Despite the importance of ethnic television within immigrant
   communities, its effects on political participation are unclear. On the
   one hand, ethnic media can mobilize and inform voters. On the other
   hand, it can serve as a source of diversion and reduce the desire to
   participate. To evaluate these competing possibilities, we implement a
   geographic regression discontinuity (GRD) approach involving Federal
   Communication Commission reception boundaries for Spanish-language
   television stations in two states. Additionally, we replicate and unpack
   our GRD analyses using three nationally representative samples of
   Latinos. Across multiple studies, we find that access to
   Spanish-language television is associated with decreases in turnout,
   ethnic civic participation, and political knowledge. We conclude by
   discussing the implications of these findings on the ethnic politics,
   political communication, and social capital literatures.},

Title = {Measurement Uncertainty in Spatial Models: ABayesian Dynamic Measurement
   Model},
Journal = {POLITICAL ANALYSIS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {27},

Abstract = {According to spatial models of political competition, parties
   strategically adjust their ideological positions to movements made by
   rival parties. Spatial econometric techniques have been proposed to
   empirically model such interdependencies and to closely convert
   theoretical expectations into statistical models. Yet, these models
   often ignore that the parties' ideological positions are latent
   variables and, as such, accompanied by a quantifiable amount of
   uncertainty. As a result, the implausible assumption of perfectly
   measured covariates impedes a proper evaluation of theoretical
   propositions. In order to bridge this gap between theory and empirics,
   the present work combines a spatial econometric model and a Bayesian
   dynamic item response model. The proposed model accurately accounts for
   measurement uncertainty and simultaneously estimates the parties'
   ideological positions and their spatial interdependencies. To verify the
   model's utility, I apply it to recorded votes from the sixteen German
   state legislatures in the period from 1988 to 2016. While exhibiting a
   notable degree of ideological mobility, the results indicate only
   moderate spatial dependencies among parties of the same party family.
   More importantly, the analysis illustrates how measurement uncertainty
   can lead to substantively different results which stresses the
   importance of appropriately incorporating theoretical expectations into
   statistical models.},

Abstract = {Elevation is a mixed-affect emotional experience in response to
   witnessing good deeds, moral beauty, or virtue. Although studied
   extensively in entertainment, it has been largely ignored in political
   communication. The results of two experimental studies with U.S. adults
   (n = 210 and n = 630) suggest that political speeches can evoke
   elevation responses, and that such an elevation response is not affected
   by the political party of the speaker. An elevating response was
   associated with greater positivity toward politics and the speaker
   (Studies 1 and 2), as well as increased perceived closeness with one's
   own party and the opposing party (Study 2). Elevation was also
   associated with lower political cynicism. These outcomes further
   predicted both intentions to participate in the political process and
   information-seeking behavior. In a time when U.S. politics seem
   especially divided, elevation may represent one possible avenue for
   encouraging political discourse and participation.},

Volume = {40},
Number = {3},

Abstract = {Research has yet to reach a definitive consensus on whether or how
   bilingualism confers benefits on Executive Function (EF): numerous
   studies show an EF advantage for bilinguals over monolinguals, while
   others indicate no significant differences. These inconsistencies
   demonstrate that the mechanisms behind a potential bilingualism-to-EF
   relationship remain unclear. Multiple factors likely impact EF outcomes
   among bilinguals, including proficiency and extent and type and
   environment of language usage. The current study explored EF skills
   among a relatively homogeneous sample of 50 Spanish-English bilingual
   young adults to provide insights into the environmental and individual
   characteristics that contribute to EF diversity. Hierarchical regression
   modeling revealed that more balanced bilingual language usage in
   specific home-based tasks (particularly TV watching), and higher
   self-reported ability in Spanish and English significantly predicted
   higher EF. Results support the developing empirical consensus that
   greater engagement in dual-language contexts bears a positive
   relationship to EF. The finding that watching TV with a balanced
   language ratio has a significant positive relationship to EF opens
   strong potential opportunities for bilinguals to access EF benefits with
   minimal effort.},

Volume = {113},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Although Europe has experienced unprecedented numbers of refugee
   arrivals in recent years, there exists almost no causal evidence
   regarding the impact of the refugee crisis on natives' attitudes, policy
   preferences, and political engagement. We exploit a natural experiment
   in the Aegean Sea, where Greek islands close to the Turkish coast
   experienced a sudden and massive increase in refugee arrivals, while
   similar islands slightly farther away did not. Leveraging a targeted
   survey of 2,070 island residents and distance to Turkey as an
   instrument, we find that direct exposure to refugee arrivals induces
   sizable and lasting increases in natives' hostility toward refugees,
   immigrants, and Muslim minorities; support for restrictive asylum and
   immigration policies; and political engagement to effect such
   exclusionary policies. Since refugees only passed through these islands,
   our findings challenge both standard economic and cultural explanations
   of anti-immigrant sentiment and show that mere exposure suffices in
   generating lasting increases in hostility.},

Journal = {DIGITAL JOURNALISM},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {7},
Number = {6},
Pages = {746-761},
Abstract = {This article examines news media coverage surrounding Facebook
   co-founder Chris Hughes's purchase of the magazine The New Republic in
   March 2012 in order to reveal the ways in which media narratives
   situated him as a new kind of media owner for a new kind of media age.
   This textual analysis is embedded within the framework of
   metajournalistic discourse, aiming to interrogate the extent to which
   characterizations of Hughes are aligned with emerging digital practices
   and neoliberal ideals. This article pays particular attention to
   coverage in the immediate aftermath of his purchase as well as to the
   new owner's letter to readers and subscribers, ultimately arguing that
   Hughes is constructed as a self-enterprising and digitally savvy media
   owner, uniquely situated to preserve journalism by bringing tech
   industry philosophies and practices into the field. An abiding conflict
   between market logics and journalistic norms underscores the broader
   danger in knitting together neoliberal ideals of entrepreneurialism and
   startup culture with notions of how journalists can and should respond
   to financial and cultural threats of digital innovation to their

Abstract = {Intersections between transnationalism, the internationalization of

   the proliferation of academic mobility is increasingly influencing
   students, instructors, and universities globally. As one of the world's

   presents two informative and contrastive perspectives based on the
   experiences of two Chinese doctoral students at a large Canadian
   university. I focus particularly on the students' national and
   transnational ideologies, identities, and future outlooks, and how these
   formative experiences and positionalities shaped their perspectives,
   goals, and motivations during their study abroad. This research
   demonstrates how the (transnational) identities of these two students
   were discursively and iteratively formed based on complex intersections
   of national and transnational discourses regarding the representations
   of overseas returnees and the students' conceptions and co-constructions
   of the legitimate academic transnational and home. These discursive
   constructions and enactments in turn had an influential effect on their
   challenges, desires, and abilities to integrate into local academic

Abstract = {This article is a quantitative and qualitative diachronic study of how
   the expression politically correct (PC) and related phrases are used in
   the American magazine Time from 1923 through 2006. The data show a
   dramatic increase in the frequency with which PC-phrases are used in the
   early 1990s. From this time onwards, the phrases are often used as a
   means of passing evaluative subjective opinions off as objectively
   reported facts, especially in reviews of cultural events, where they
   figure prominently. In contrast to earlier studies, our data show that
   PC-phrases are not inherently negative; this applies primarily to
   discourse on environment and business, where to be PC often implies
   being environmentally or socially conscious in a positive sense.
   Nevertheless, negative or ironic uses of the terms predominate. Most
   often they express criticism of unspoken cultural norms rather than
   being attempts to close down debate or criticizing the replacement of
   offensive terms by more neutral expressions.},

Abstract = {Conversation-for-learning (Kasper and Kim 2015) is a pedagogical
   arrangement set up with a view to maximizing the potential benefit of
   interaction for language learning. As participants for
   conversation-for-learning are recruited for their relative expertise in
   the target languages, the talk is often characterized by asymmetries in
   knowledge and language expertise. Based on sequential analysis of how
   the knowledge asymmetries are brought to the fore of interaction and how
   they are subsequently dealt with, the current study illustrates how
   learning opportunities are generated in conversation-for-learning, that
   is, by collaborative achievement of definition sequences (Markee 1994).
   Interaction provides an observable space where interactional practices
   deployed by the participants to achieve and maintain intersubjectivity
   can be observed and appropriated. The study contributes to our
   understanding of language learning as a social practice as it shows that
   the methods and devices that underlie and enable human sociality
   constitute the cornerstones of what makes language learning happen in
   interaction.},

Title = {Education and Anti-Immigration Attitudes: Evidence from Compulsory
   Schooling Reforms across Western Europe},
Journal = {AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},

Volume = {113},

Abstract = {Low levels of education are a powerful predictor of anti-immigration
   sentiment. However, there is little consensus on the interpretation of
   this correlation: is it causal or is it an artifact of selection bias?
   We address this question by exploiting six major compulsory schooling
   reforms in five Western European countries-Denmark, France, Great
   Britain, the Netherlands, and Sweden-that have recently experienced
   politically influential anti-immigration movements. On average, we find
   that compelling students to remain in secondary school for at least an
   additional year decreases anti-immigration attitudes later in life.
   Instrumental variable estimates demonstrate that, among such compliers,
   an additional year of secondary schooling substantially reduces the
   probability of opposing immigration, believing that immigration erodes a
   country's quality of life, and feeling close to far-right
   anti-immigration parties. These results suggest that rising post-war
   educational attainment has mitigated the rise of anti-immigration
   movements. We discuss the mechanisms and implications for future
   research examining anti-immigration sentiment.},

Volume = {40},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {This study investigates if participation in mother tongue instruction
   (henceforth MTI) impacts the biliteracy proficiency of young bilinguals,
   drawing on examples from Somali-Swedish bilinguals and Somali MTI in a
   Swedish school context. In the study, biliteracy was operationalized as
   reading proficiency and vocabulary knowledge in two languages, which was
   tested with measures of word decoding, reading comprehension, and
   vocabulary breadth and depth. The study was designed to allow for
   cross-sectional, longitudinal, and cross-linguistic analyses of data.
   Overall, the results showed that participation in MTI contributed
   positively to participants' results on Somali reading comprehension,
   beyond the influence of chronological age, age of arrival, and reported
   home language and literacy use. Furthermore, higher results in Somali
   were associated with higher results on the same measures in Swedish, in
   particular for the reading measures. In sum, the results indicate that
   MTI has an impact on some aspects of literacy proficiency in the mother
   tongue, despite the restricted time allocated for it (<1 h/week). They
   also indicate that MTI, albeit indirectly, may benefit the stated
   proficiencies in the language of schooling.},

Volume = {7},

Pages = {1200-1214},
Abstract = {Can the promise of data-driven reporting as an empirical form of
   journalistic inquiry take root in the Arab region, where public data are
   often inaccessible, equipment and skills are in short supply, and
   civic-affairs journalism is hamstrung by wary governments? Sixteen data
   journalists working in Arab nations were identified through multiple
   inquiries and a snowball sample that achieved saturation. Informants
   described data journalism as the careful analysis of numerical evidence
   to provide credible and sometimes visual information to audiences on
   subjects otherwise off limits and which aligns journalists with
   perceived global professional standards. Four types of barriers emerged:
   two structural (insufficient data access and social/political
   expectations) and two individualistic (ignorance and resistance).
   Combined, those barriers affirm journalistic role conception research
   and the value of metajournalistic discourse theory to reveal that the
   fundamental obstacle in the region is not a paucity of data but the
   ontological limitation of the dominant loyal-facilitator role.},

Abstract = {This study extends previous input-based grammar instruction research
   (for reviews, DeKeyser and Prieto Botana 2015; Shintani 2015) by
   comparing two types of input-based practice with the same explicit
   information for learning L2 German definite article case-marking cues
   (der, den). Participants (N=138, aged 9-11) received explicit
   information followed by either task-essential practice in making
   form-meaning connections (referential activities from Processing
   Instruction) OR task-essential practice in spotting the form (word
   noticing activities). Both interventions yielded equivalent durable
   gains across six ecologically valid tests of comprehension and
   production (written and oral modalities), compared to no gains in a
   control group. The findings revealed that, following explicit
   information, input practice requiring engagement with the target feature
   (as proposed by Svalberg 2012) was equally effective as task-essential
   form-meaning connection practice, shedding important light on previous
   claims in the research agenda on task-essential input practice (Marsden
   2006; Marsden and Chen 2011). Responding to calls for ecologically valid
   effect-of-instruction research (Mitchell 2000; Spada 2015), this
   classroom study demonstrates the efficacy of grammar practice for young
   learners within input-poor foreign language classrooms.},

Abstract = {While the rules of international trade regimes prevent governments from
   employing protectionist instruments, governments continue to seek out
   veiled means of supporting their national industries. This article
   argues that the news media can serve as one channel for governments to
   favor domestic industries. Focusing on media coverage of auto recalls in
   China, I reveal a systematic bias against foreign automakers in those
   newspapers under strict government control. I further analyze
   subnational reporting patterns, exploiting variation in the level of
   regional government interest in the automobile industry. The analysis
   suggests that the media's home bias is driven by the government's
   protectionist interests but rules out the alternative hypothesis that
   home bias simply reflects the nationalist sentiment of readers. I show
   that this home bias in news coverage has meaningful impact on actual
   consumer behavior, combining automobile sales data and information on
   recall-related web searches.},

Abstract = {This article investigates the experiences in knowledge development and
   sharing of a group of migrant teachers from different Asian countries
   who are teaching in secondary schools in Hong Kong. Seeing dispositions
   as the key to professionalization and professional contributions, it
   explores the possibilities and challenges in harnessing the professional
   value of their transnational disposition. Semi-structured interviews
   were conducted to investigate the participants' position in the
   workplace, negotiations of the local curriculum and classroom practice,
   and professional interactions with colleagues and parents. The findings
   show that these teachers actively respond to invisibility and
   marginalization by drawing from their transcultural disposition to
   creatively but cautiously transform pedagogical practices and
   discourses. It is found that the presence of migrant professionals in
   local context provides opportunities for critical reflexivity and
   transnational awareness among local professionals. It is implied that
   the changes in thinking and awareness may lead to broad-based
   ideological and structural changes, which in turn promotes productive

Abstract = {In the context of recent debates for and against the reality of
   `long-term English learners (LTELs)' in US secondary schools, the
   diversity of these students' classroom experiences and opportunities to
   develop academically valued forms of English is often overlooked. This
   analysis draws upon a data from middle school classrooms in the South
   Atlantic region of the USA and focuses particularly on the classroom
   experiences of six 6th-grade students classified as `English learners'
   who have been in US schools since kindergarten. We use a multiple case
   study approach (Stake 2006) to analyze qualitative classroom
   observations completed in `mainstream' classrooms alongside teacher and
   student interviews to examine the extent to which classroom-based peer
   and teacher-student interactions offer opportunities for language
   acquisition/development. Varied patterns of engagement and interaction
   were found, but most students had relatively few substantive academic
   discussions with peers or teachers. The diversity of our six students'
   experiences, and of the language expertise they demonstrate, suggests
   that `LTEL' obscures more than it elucidates regarding these students'
   academic and linguistic strengths and needs.},

Abstract = {Word association has been a popular tool for research in linguistics and

   association tasks, and on the assumption that responses reflect the
   strongest link between words in the participants' vocabulary. The
   procedure adopted in traditional word association tasks does not
   guarantee that this is the case. This article presents two experiments
   that aimed to determine whether or not participants make deliberate and

Journal = {APPLIED LINGUISTICS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {39},

Abstract = {Metadiscourse has received considerable attention in recent years as a
   way of understanding the rhetorical negotiations involved in academic
   writing. But while a useful tool in revealing something of the dynamic
   interactions which underlie persuasive claim making, it has little to
   say about the role of nouns in this process. We address this gap by
   exploring the rhetorical functions of what we call metadiscursive nouns
   (such as fact, analysis, belief) and by mapping them onto a model of
   metadiscourse. The study examines `metadiscursive noun + post-nominal
   clause' patterns, one of the most frequent structures containing such
   nouns, in a corpus of 120 research articles across six disciplines.
   Developing a rhetorically based classification and exploring the
   interactive and interactional use of metadiscursive nouns, we show that
   they are another key element of metadiscourse, offering writers a way of
   organizing discourse into a cohesive flow of information and of
   constructing a stance towards it. These interactions are further shown
   to realize the epistemological assumptions and rhetorical practices of
   particular disciplines.},

Title = {The Acquisitive Nature of Extraverted CEOs},
Journal = {ADMINISTRATIVE SCIENCE QUARTERLY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {63},
Number = {2},
Pages = {370-408},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {This study examines how extraversion, a personality trait that signifies
   more or less positive affect, assertive behavior, decisive thinking, and
   desires for social engagement, influences chief executive officers'
   (CEOs') decisions and the ensuing strategic behavior of firms. Using a
   novel linguistic technique to assess personality from unscripted text
   spoken by 2,381 CEOs of S\&P 1500 firms over ten years, we show that
   CEOs' extraversion influences the merger and acquisition (M\&A) behavior
   of firms above and beyond other well-established personality traits. We
   find that extraverted CEOs are more likely to engage in acquisitions,
   and to conduct larger ones, than other CEOs and that these effects are
   partially explained by their higher representation on boards of other
   firms. Moreover, we find that the acquisitive nature of extraverted CEOs
   reveals itself particularly in so-called ``weaker'' situations, in which
   CEOs enjoy considerable discretion to behave in ways akin to their
   personality traits. Subsequent analyses show that extraverted CEOs are
   also more likely than other CEOs to succeed in M\&As, as reflected by
   stronger abnormal returns following acquisition announcements.},

Abstract = {Media effects research has focused so intently on effects that it has
   neglected the richly informative domain of persuasive messages that have
   no effects, have reverse boomerang effects, or have unintended and
   unanticipated consequences. This results in a paradoxical paradigmatic
   gap: a theoretical blind spot. I propose we broaden our research focus
   to include systematic patterns of miscommunication and non-communication
   in the interpretive dynamics of both mass and interpersonal
   communication. This review explores evolving research on persistent
   misinformation and counterfactual beliefs, and the underlying psychology
   of cognitive distortion and selective attention. Research methodologies
   of particular promise are reviewed, including transmission chain
   studies, textual analysis, and the rich domain of ``big data{''}

Year = {2018},
Volume = {39},

Pages = {117-134},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The study presented in this article explores to what extent and in what
   ways the communication between clinicians and patients on Ask-the-Expert
   healthcare websites is patient-centred. It further demonstrates the
   value of using a theory and text-driven discourse analytical approach
   for the analysis of verbal communication in a (specific health)
   professional domain. The UK website Netdoctor is used as a case study.
   Thirty exchanges from this site, on the topic of depression, were
   analysed using a discourse-pragmatic framework, drawing on existing
   theories and definitions of patient-centred communication (PCC), a
   classification of empathic: cotmnunication acts (Pounds 2011) and
   existing research on advice giving in online communication. The analysis
   shows that, overall, experts make wide use of PCC, particularly empathic
   expression, in their online responses. The author concludes that there
   is a high potential for the expression of PCC on Ask-the-Expert health
   sites and that this may be more or less exploited, depending on the
   restrictions imposed on the contributors by the site managers and users'
   expectations},

Abstract = {We study a core question of interest in political science: Do candidates
   position themselves differently under different electoral systems and is
   their positioning in line with the expectations of spatial theories? We
   use validated estimates of candidate ideological positions derived from
   quantitative scaling of 7,497 Japanese-language election manifestos
   written by the near universe of candidates who competed in the eight
   House of Representatives elections held on either side of Japan's 1994
   electoral reform. Leveraging variation before and after Japan's
   electoral reform, as well as within each electoral system, we find that
   candidates converge in single-member districts and diverge in
   multimember districts, and converge on copartisans when not faced with
   intraparty competition and diverge when they do. Our study helps to
   clarify debates about the effects of electoral systems on ideological
   polarization and party cohesion in Japan and more generally.},

Abstract = {Candidates for political office in the United States can appeal to

   on large, diverse samples of both monolingual and bilingual Americans.
   We take advantage of parallel advertisements produced in both English
   and Spanish by real candidates for national officeone presidential and
   two congressional. Because our design holds constant candidates' policy
   positions, we can attribute the effects on vote choice directly to the
   choice of language over and above other candidate attributes. In two of
   our three experiments, the Spanish-language advertisements increased
   candidates' electoral support by 5 percentage points among bilinguals.
   We find the opposite pattern of results among English-speaking
   monolingual Americans, who respond very negatively to Spanish-language
   advertisements. Our results shed light on the strategic calculus of
   candidates who must appeal to multiple linguistic communities at once.},

Abstract = {The ability to build boundaries, known as boundary work, is typically

   case study of metajournalistic discourse around the Center for Public
   Integrity, one of the oldest and largest news nonprofits in the United
   States, finds the Center engaging instead in what I have called
   ``boundary evolution,{''} starting out self-consciously outside of
   journalism, and gradually working its way in. This insight helps us
   understand the power that marginal players wield in positioning
   themselves relative to larger participants. It also points to how
   players can evolve against the background of a changing ecology; in this
   case, the Center for Public Integrity came to see a place for itself in
   journalism only after funding cuts left news organizations hungry for
   quality, free content, and the digital environment normalized sharing.},

   Polarization in Westminster Systems},
Journal = {POLITICAL ANALYSIS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {26},
Number = {1},
Pages = {120-128},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Measuring the polarization of legislators and parties is a key step in
   understanding how politics develops over time. But in parliamentary
   systems-where ideological positions estimated from roll calls may not be
   informative-producing valid estimates is extremely challenging. We
   suggest a new measurement strategy that makes innovative use of the
   ``accuracy{''} of machine classifiers, i.e., the number of correct
   predictions made as a proportion of all predictions. In our case, the
   ``labels{''} are the party identifications of the members of parliament,
   predicted from their speeches along with some information on debate
   subjects. Intuitively, when the learner is able to discriminate members
   in the two main Westminster parties well, we claim we are in a period of
   ``high{''} polarization. By contrast, when the classifier has low
   accuracy-and makes a relatively large number of mistakes in terms of
   allocating members to parties based on the data-we argue parliament is
   in an era of ``low{''} polarization. This approach is fast and
   substantively valid, and we demonstrate its merits with simulations, and
   by comparing the estimates from 7 8 years of House of Commons speeches
   with qualitativeand quantitative historical accounts of the same. As a
   headline finding, wenote that contemporary British politics is
   approximately as polarized as itwas in the mid-1960s-that is, in the
   middle of the ``postwar consensus{''}. More broadly, we show that the
   technical performance of supervised learning algorithms can be directly
   informative about substantive matters in social science.},

Journal = {POLITICAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {35},
Number = {2},
Pages = {306-326},
Abstract = {This article examines the sources of ideological skepticism about two
   issues where there is a scientific consensus: climate change and
   evolution. The results indicate that self-identified conservatives doubt
   global warming in large part because of elite rhetoric, but that
   evolution beliefs are unrelated to reception of political discourse.
   News reception is perhaps the strongest predictor of conservatives'
   climate change skepticism, but has no influence on their aversion to
   evolution. Moreover, the article leverages three sources of variation in
   elite discourse on climate changetemporal, cross-national, and
   experimentalto show that changes in the prevalence of ideological cues
   strongly affect public opinion about global warming. Politically
   attentive conservatives, in fact, were more likely to believe scientists
   about global warming than liberals were in the 1990s before the media
   depicted climate change as a partisan issue. The United States is also
   the only nation where political interest significantly predicts both
   conservatives' skepticism about, and liberals' belief in, climate
   change. Finally, evidence from a national survey experiment suggests
   that Americans would be less skeptical of manmade global warming if more
   Republicans in Congress believed in it, but a growing Congressional
   consensus about evolution would not diminish doubts about its existence.},

   age?},
Journal = {DIGITAL JOURNALISM},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {6},
Number = {2},
Pages = {256-273},
Abstract = {Journalism in general-Anglo-American journalism in particular-has
   undergone a number of profound changes within and outside the newsroom.
   This paper explores whether these changes have weakened the basis of
   journalistic legitimacy, or have offered new grounds for journalistic
   legitimacy, and, in each case, to what extent. It is argued that a
   number of factors, including the financial difficulties of news media,
   the decentralisation of public communication as facilitated by the
   internet, the dual dilemmas faced by both objective and partisan
   journalism, and the belligerent public discourse about journalism are
   delegitimising journalism. However, the legitimatisation of journalism
   can be found in the efforts of news organisations-not only leading news
   organisations such as the Guardian and the New York Times but also
   regional and local ones such as the Trinity Mirror group and the Palm
   Beach Post-in adopting and possessing digital and technological tools
   and skills, and in defending their journalism. The relegitimation of
   journalism reiterates and reinforces the historically shaped essence of
   journalism that reflects a continuity of legacy journalism; and this is
   an organisational and occupational response to, and boundary defence
   against, the trend of delegitimation of journalism in the digital era.},

Pages = {1294-1313},
Abstract = {This qualitative study explores how national security journalists
   communicate online using digital security technologies to evade
   potential surveillance by government authorities. This study follows a
   panopticism framework, which states that those under real or perceived
   observation will alter their behavior to be more subservient to
   authority. Through a series of seven in-depth interviews with
   journalists, using a constant comparative method, journalists who
   participated in this study reported that the way they work has changed
   under a real or perceived threat of mass government surveillance, making
   their work more difficult and potentially damaging their communications
   with sources. Many potential interview subjects refused to participate
   on the record because of the sensitivity and potential risks involved in
   the discussion of the subject matter.},

Title = {CLEANING UP THE ``FETID SWAMP{''} Examining how journalists construct
   policies and practices for moderating comments},
Journal = {DIGITAL JOURNALISM},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {6},
Number = {1},
Pages = {21-40},
Abstract = {Online commenting has become a popular form of audience-journalist
   interaction. However, journalists have become frustrated with commenters
   who use forums to attack and make assertions. As journalists look for
   ways to reign in commenters, it becomes important to consider how
   journalists make decisions about moderation policies and practices. This
   study used gatekeeping theory to consider how one organization
   approached moderation and related issues of content management. The
   researcher conducted a one-month ethnography of a large news
   organization and their online forums and discovered that journalists set
   high expectations of commenters, but willingly accept low-quality
   content. Journalists appear to struggle with how to institute policies
   that promote high-quality discourse without engaging in intense battles
   with the audience and having to devote more resources to moderation.
   Journalists focus on establishing balance between allowing the audience
   to have a conversation without allowing that conversation to disrupt the
   traditional practices of journalism.},

Abstract = {How human beings think about, talk about, and organize around sexuality
   is changing. Growing social legitimization for sexual minority
   relationships and a more fluid social understanding of sexual identities
   has shifted how we bound normal sexuality. In the workplace, these
   shifting norms affect employees of all sexual identities who must make
   sense of new policies and complex daily practices. This paper introduces
   the concept of co-sexuality, the push-and-pull process of
   communicatively organizing around sexuality. Using this concept, we take
   a grounded theory approach to exploring how employees of various
   sexualities and in different occupations understand normal sexuality and
   subsequently organize around it. Ultimately, participants described
   being silenced or silencing another to maintain sexual norms at work.},

Abstract = {This study advances Thoemmes and Conway's seminal work on integrative

   IC and charisma in the State of the Union address. I examined a census
   of SOTU addresses given from George Washington to Barack Obama using
   Boas Shamir's self-concept based motivational charisma construct. IC and
   charisma were positively related for presidents in the first terms in
   office; however, this relation only held for presidents who eventually
   won reelection. Data also confirmed a positive correlation between
   charisma and the likelihood of reelection. I describe various trends in
   the data with respect to charisma and IC for time in office. Overall,
   findings show that using IC in leadership studies may be a worthwhile
   endeavor, as is measuring charisma by computer given that this measure
   correlated reasonably well with measures of charisma derived from other
   sources.},

Journal = {AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {111},
Number = {4},
Pages = {738-754},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {In recent years, a number of scholars have taken parties and
   partisanship as objects of normative theorizing. They posit partisanship
   as a fundamentally democratic practice and develop a model of what
   partisans can do at their best to contribute to liberal democracy.
   However, the standards the literature puts forth remain insufficiently
   specified to serve as empirical benchmarks. This article further
   conceptualizes this model of democratic partisanship and offers a
   theoretical framework within which to empirically evaluate the
   democratic merits of partisan discourses. It establishes a series of
   indicators for assessing the extent to which partisan discourse displays
   two main qualities: cohesiveness and respect for political pluralism.
   The article then discusses the implications of using this theoretical
   framework as a basis for empirical studies and shows how the model can
   thereby benefit both political scientists and theorists.},

Abstract = {This study investigates how the use of discourse markers reflects
   speaking fluency in Chinese learners. In this study, 220 min of online
   Chinese courses were transcribed, with 17 Chinese learners and 5 native
   Chinese teachers as participants. Half of the transcribed data were
   drawn from students living in Taipei, Taiwan, a Chinese-speaking
   environment, learning Chinese as a second language. The other portion of
   the data was collected from students living in non-Chinese-speaking
   countries, learning Chinese as a foreign language with little exposure
   to the language outside the classroom. Analysis of the transcripts
   supported the hypothesis that the frequency of discourse markers used by
   individual speakers reflects their fluency in the target language.
   Further analyses of the function of discourse markers produced by the
   three participant groups suggested that understanding the ability to use
   discourse markers can be a valuable tool to evaluate, assess, and gauge
   richness of spoken content, as well as to aid in the development of
   teaching methods.},

   statements as a corpus. Our objective is to analyze the underlying
   conceptualizations of teaching/learning, the teachers' perception of the
   students, and the teachers' self-perception. To do so, we have adopted a
   mixture of qualitative and quantitative methods. The framework adopted
   is Lakoff and Johnson's cognitive theory of metaphor, in particular the
   primacy of the conceptual over the linguistic, the power of metaphor to
   highlight and hide experience, and metaphor's inferential system of
   entailments. The conceptualizations of the domain of foreign language
   teaching and learning are then measured against concepts in the
   philosophy of education such as teacher centeredness, student
   centeredness, and learning centeredness, using cost-benefit analyses.},

Abstract = {Can the way we speak affect the way we perceive time and think about
   politics? Languages vary by how much they require speakers to
   grammatically encode temporal differences. Futureless tongues (e.g.,
   Estonian) do not oblige speakers to distinguish between the present and
   future tense, whereas futured tongues do (e.g., Russian). By
   grammatically conflating today and tomorrow, we hypothesize that
   speakers of futureless tongues will view the future as temporally closer
   to the present, causing them to discount the future less and support
   future-oriented policies more. Using an original survey experiment that
   randomly assigned the interview language to Estonian/Russian bilinguals,
   we find support for this proposition and document the absence of this
   language effect when a policy has no obvious time referent. We then
   replicate and extend our principal result through a cross-national
   analysis of survey data. Our results imply that language may have
   significant consequences for mass opinion.},

   planning conditions over a two-week period via text-chat. Two tasks were
   used as experimental tasks to gauge immediate planning effect on L2
   production and the other two as new tasks to gauge L2 development.
   Results showed that both types of planning condition supported immediate
   production complexity but the ROP condition was more effective in
   leading to more accurate use of grammatical verb forms. With regard to
   the subsequent development of production complexity and accuracy, the
   ROP condition was more effective in leading to improvement on clausal
   complexity as well as control over the use of grammatical verb forms and
   avoidance of general errors.},

Volume = {38},

Abstract = {The language classroom and contexts beyond provide different
   environments for learning. In the classroom, L2 users are typically and
   primarily labeled `learners', whereas beyond the classroom, `in the
   wild' to borrow a term from Hutchins (1995), any aspect of their
   identity might take prominence (Firth and Wagner 1997). Drawing on data
   sets from classroom and non-classroom settings, this article shows two
   examples of the interactional work that goes into preparing for learning
   and how the ensuing learning/teaching activities are carried out. In
   both cases, participants co-construct learning/teaching spaces; the
   article shows how the two contexts call on different resources to
   accomplish this. Moreover, the actual learning sequences in interaction,
   framed around repair activities, are different in the two contexts; in
   the wild, the learning space is more condensed, embedded in the
   business-doing of the service encounter, whereas in class the activities
   are more extensive, the consequentiality is relaxed as speakers easily
   refer back to previous repair work and word searches, and they draw on
   writing and reading to an extent arguably rarely possible in
   non-classroom contexts.},

Abstract = {This article argues against prevailing scholarly trends that the
   Florentine Histories continues to delineate the ways through which
   Niccol Machiavelli, in The Prince and the Discourses, advised potential
   founders or reformers to exploit, for their own benefit and that of
   their patria, the inevitable social conflicts between elites and the
   people that arise in all polities. Machiavelli demonstrates that, in
   particular, Giano della Bella and Michele di Lando could and should have
   attempted to imitate exemplary ancient founders and reformers whom he
   praises in previous works, especially Moses, Romulus, and Brutus.
   Machiavelli implicitly criticizes Giano and Michele for failing to
   spiritedly invigorate new laws with necessary and salutary violence; for
   neglecting to effectively manage the envy of rival peers; for not
   resisting the allure of middle ways between difficult political choices;
   and for failing to militarily organize or mobilize the entirety of
   Florence's common people.},

Abstract = {This study analyzes the political agenda of the European Parliament (EP)
   plenary, how it has evolved over time, and the manner in which Members
   of the European Parliament (MEPs) have reacted to external and internal
   stimuli when making plenary speeches. To unveil the plenary agenda and
   detect latent themes in legislative speeches over time, MEP speech
   content is analyzed using a new dynamic topic modeling method based on
   two layers of Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF). This method is
   applied to a new corpus of all English language legislative speeches in
   the EP plenary from the period 1999 to 2014. Our findings suggest that
   two-layer NMF is a valuable alternative to existing dynamic topic
   modeling approaches found in the literature, and can unveil niche topics
   and associated vocabularies not captured by existing methods.
   Substantively, our findings suggest that the political agenda of the EP
   evolves significantly over time and reacts to exogenous events such as
   EU Treaty referenda and the emergence of the Euro Crisis. MEP
   contributions to the plenary agenda are also found to be impacted upon
   by voting behavior and the committee structure of the Parliament.},

Journal = {DIGITAL JOURNALISM},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {5},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {318-333},
Abstract = {In May 13, 2013, the Associated Press announced that the United States
   Department of Justice had secretly subpoenaed phone records from
   Associated Press phone lines over a two-month period in early 2012. A
   few days later, on May 17, the Washington Post revealed that the
   Department of Justice had also been tracking the activities of Fox News'
   chief Washington correspondent, James Rosen. These two stories caused
   large scandals in the United States, and the majority of American
   journalists denounced the surveillance. As these scandals were still
   unfolding, yet another government surveillance scandal broke: former
   National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden revealed that the
   federal government had been collecting the cell phone metadata of
   American citizens for several years. Journalists' responses to this
   scandal were more nuanced; editorials expressed a wider spectrum of
   views about the ethics of government surveillance practices, and more
   complex opinions about the legitimacy and necessity of government
   surveillance. Drawing on approaches to journalistic professionalism,
   this study uses qualitative textual analysis to assess editorials
   written in response to these three revelations. The analysis suggests
   that journalists see their speech as something deserving of unique
   protections, above and beyond those protections afforded to the general
   public.},

Journal = {DIGITAL JOURNALISM},

Volume = {5},

Pages = {277-298},
Abstract = {Open curtains and a careless attitude. The Dutch are described as
   holding an indifferent stance towards privacy in the aftermath of
   Snowden's revelations of far-reaching government surveillance. But are
   Dutch reactions as aloof as often claimed? This study provides an
   in-depth overview of privacy attitudes in the Dutch debate about the
   National Security Agency (NSA) leaks, showing a greater variety of
   sentiments than anticipated. A qualitative frame analysis and a
   quantitative descriptive analysis resulted in six frames, which convey
   distinct privacy attitudes. Online and offline as well as professional
   and non-journalistic content in the debate displays a different
   distribution of frames. The frames, ranging from an ``End justifies the
   means{''} attitude to an anxious fear of an ``Orwellian dystopia{''},
   are placed in a larger framework as the research demonstrates the
   connection to existing theories about privacy and surveillance. Dutch
   discussions about the NSA revelations often display a trade-off
   narrative balancing safety against privacy, and include
   (de)legitimisation strategies. These outcomes are in line with previous
   studies about mediated surveillance debates, which indicates that
   privacy attitudes transcend national boundaries. However, the inclusion
   of user-generated content adds an individual dimension to the existing
   body of research and reveals a personal perspective on surveillance
   issues.},

Abstract = {While a great deal of attention has been paid to how political media can

   theories from social psychology, I outline and test a set of theoretical
   predictions to explore this relationship in the context of
   Spanish-language political ads. The results suggest that
   Spanish-language political ads do, in fact, increase perceptions of
   collective political power among Latinos, but not in a way that
   unequivocally promote perceptions of political homogeneity. In doing so,
   the findings provide some of the first evidence of a causal relationship

   play in producing these effects. A survey-experiment with a quota sample
   of 471 participants reveals that, overall, symbolic threat appeals exert
   stronger effects on anti-immigrant attitudes than economic ones. When
   presented via text alone, only symbolicnot economicthreat appeals
   increased anti-immigrant attitudes via the activation of heuristic
   processing such as the reliance on negative stereotypes or feelings of
   anxiety, in particular among lower-educated citizens. When visuals were
   present, both types of threat appeals enhanced anti-immigrant attitudes
   among citizens across all education levels based on heuristic
   processing. Additionally, high image-text congruency induced cognitive
   argument approval resulting in higher anti-immigrant attitudes.},

   and ``The Day We Fight Back{''} online protest day. A close reading of
   the two campaigns with a special focus on organizers' and participants'
   choice of frames, narratives, and iconography reveals how privacy
   activists have tried to exploit the political opportunity structures of
   the Snowden leaks and receive media attention. Through the use of
   historical, cultural, and global framing devices, as well as a
   particular focus on the actions of individual celebrity activists,
   organizers have sought to mobilize the public against surveillance. As a
   thorough look at the subsequent media coverage of the campaigns reveals,
   the framing activities opened discursive spaces in the contemporary
   debate about the effects and consequences of mass surveillance. Thus,
   these two case studies offer important insights both into the grassroots
   political communication tactics of privacy advocates and the
   representation of anti-surveillance sentiments in the mainstream media.},

Abstract = {In the aftermath of Edward Snowden's leaks about ``bulk data

   Communications Headquarters, questions about mass surveillance have come
   to the forefront of public debate. This paper, based on (1) a
   comprehensive content analysis of newspaper coverage, and (2) interviews
   with journalists covering stories related to surveillance in the United
   Kingdom, outlines a key tension between journalists' self-understandings
   and practices which has profound consequences. On the one hand, we
   suggest, media coverage contributes to normalizing surveillance by
   emphasizing concerns about national security and stressing the
   surveillance of elites, to the detriment of an interest in the gathering
   of ``bulk data{''} on populations. On the other hand, journalists,
   though acknowledging national security concerns, are frequently critical
   of and resistant to the extent, nature and necessity of mass
   surveillance. Our paper suggests that despite journalists' desire to
   communicate the complexities of mass surveillance, the structural
   constraints of their professional practice-in particular their reliance
   on official sources-make it difficult for reporting to move beyond the
   legitimating discourses provided by these official sources.},

Abstract = {Public officials in John Rawls's well-ordered society face an assurance
   problem. They prefer to act in accordance with the political conception
   of justice, but only if they are assured that others will. On Paul
   Weithman's influential interpretation, Rawls attempts to solve this
   problem by claiming that public reason is an assurance mechanism. There
   are several problems with Rawls's solution: Public reason talk is too
   cheap to facilitate assurance, it is difficult to know when particular
   utterances express public reasons, and the requirements of public reason
   conflict with the fact of reasonable pluralism. We argue that
   convergence discourse-not public reason-solves the assurance problem by
   being a costly signal that indicates commitment to the political
   conception. This solution has none of Rawls's problems and has an
   interesting corollary: As diversity increases in society, so too does
   society's ability to solve the assurance problem. In short, the more
   diversity the better},

Abstract = {Despite the relevance of nationalism for politics and intergroup
   relations, sociologists have devoted surprisingly little attention to
   the phenomenon in the United States, and historians and political
   psychologists who do study the United States have limited their focus to
   specific forms of nationalist sentiment: ethnocultural or civic
   nationalism, patriotism, or national pride. This article innovates,
   first, by examining an unusually broad set of measures (from the 2004
   GSS) tapping national identification, ethnocultural and civic criteria
   for national membership, domain-specific national pride, and invidious
   comparisons to other nations, thus providing a fuller depiction of
   Americans' national self-understanding. Second, we use latent class
   analysis to explore heterogeneity, partitioning the sample into classes
   characterized by distinctive patterns of attitudes. Conventional
   distinctions between ethnocultural and civic nationalism describe just
   about half of the U.S. population and do not account for the
   unexpectedly low levels of national pride found among respondents who
   hold restrictive definitions of American nationhood. A subset of
   primarily younger and well-educated Americans lacks any strong form of
   patriotic sentiment; a larger class, primarily older and less well
   educated, embraces every form of nationalist sentiment. Controlling for
   sociodemographic characteristics and partisan identification, these
   classes vary significantly in attitudes toward ethnic minorities,
   immigration, and national sovereignty. Finally, using comparable data
   from 1996 and 2012, we find structural continuity and distributional
   change in national sentiments over a period marked by terrorist attacks,
   war, economic crisis, and political contention.},

Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {60},
Number = {4},
Pages = {845-859},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Riders to appropriations bills have long been a favorite congressional
   instrument for forcing presidents to accept unwanted policies. To resist
   unwanted riders, presidents have increasingly resorted to veto threats.
   Are such threats credible, and do they influence legislation? To answer
   these questions, we analyze the legislative histories of hundreds of
   threatened and unthreatened riders from 1985 through 2008. We find that
   threats are effective in bringing the final legislation closer to the
   president's preferences. Threats achieve their success, in large part,
   by interrupting the textbook legislative process in the Senate-spawning
   filibusters, prompting leaders to punt bills to conference, and
   encouraging the use of other ``unorthodox{''} procedures. Unlike
   conventional models that regard veto threats as minimally effective, the
   findings presented here depict veto rhetoric as integral to identifying
   critical riders separating the legislative parties that must be resolved
   in order to avoid gridlock and pass annual appropriations legislation.},

   opportunity for three American high school students of varying
   proficiency in Chinese and their Chinese hosts. Specifically, analysis
   of contextualized language practices at mealtime reveals the qualities
   of these interactions for learning Chinese and American culinary
   practices, related language, and associated ideologies. Our findings
   suggest that even short-term homestays can be particularly rich
   environments for language learning as hosts and students explore
   divergent views on the aesthetic, moral, and health-related dimensions

Abstract = {In this article, I theorize complicit masculinity to examine how access
   to capital, in other words, making or spending money, mediates masculine
   identity for un- and underemployed black men. Arguing that hegemony
   operates around producer-provider norms of masculinity and through
   tropes of blackness within a system of racial capitalism, I show how
   complicity underscores the reality of differential aspirational models
   in the context of severe un- and underemployment and the failure of the
   classic breadwinner model for black men globally. I draw on participant
   observation fieldwork and interviews with men from Abidjan, Cote
   d'Ivoire's informal sector from 2008 to 2009. I investigate two groups
   of men: political propagandists (orators) for former President Laurent
   Gbagbo and mobile street vendors. Rejecting racialized colonial
   narratives that positioned salaried workers as evolved, orators used
   anti-French rhetoric and ties to the political regime to pursue
   entrepreneurial identities. Vendors, positioned as illegitimate workers
   and non-citizens, asserted consumerist models of masculinity from global
   black popular culture. I show how entrepreneurialism and consumerism,
   the two paradigmatic neoliberal identities, have become ways for black
   men to assert economic participation as alternatives to the
   producer-provider ideal.},

Abstract = {The rise of sound-bite news is one of the most widely bemoaned findings

   this trend have been more assumed than demonstrated. This study examines
   one consequence of sound-bite journalism: the creation of incomplete
   argument, in which speakers presenting their political position in the
   news do not also justify it. Drawing on data about television news in
   Germany, Russia, and the United States, it shows that shrinking sound
   bites consistently reduce the probability of opinion justification
   across widely differing national contexts. Sound-bite journalism emerges
   as harmful to television news' ability to produce public justification.},

Abstract = {Words are believed to be indicators of the values that are important to
   politicians and an impressive amount of empirical research has analyzed
   variations in language use. While it is generally accepted that there
   are value differences between Democrats and Republicans, the extent to
   which these differences are reflected in word usage has been theorized
   but is largely untested. The connection between values and language is,
   theoretically, not limited just to politicians, but should be especially
   evident among politicians as representatives of existing ideological
   poles. In this article, we examine elite rhetoric through the lens of
   four value-centered theoretical frameworks (Lakoff's Parenting Styles
   model, Moral Foundations Theory, Schwartz's Values Theory, and Motivated
   Social Cognition Theory). Contrary to the expectations posited by these
   four theories, we find little reliable evidence of value-related
   language differences between Democratic and Republican politicians. Our
   findings suggest that, at least when it comes to elite rhetoric, widely
   accepted theoretical claims about the value-based nature of political
   language and political differences are not consistently supported by
   empirical analysis.},

Abstract = {The sparse literature on the use of imperatives in research papers
   suggests that they are relatively common in a small number of
   disciplines, but rare, if used at all, in others. The present study
   addresses the use of imperatives in a corpus of upper-level A-graded
   student papers from 16 disciplines. A total of 822 papers collected
   within the past 5 years were analyzed for imperative use, with
   particular emphasis placed on the main text of papers from the five
   disciplines with the highest proportion of imperatives. In each of these
   disciplines, text-based interviews were conducted with faculty members

   used frequently in physics, philosophy, economics, mechanical
   engineering, and linguistics, though in quite varying ways. The
   interview data suggest that successful and experienced student writers
   adopt the potentially `high risk strategy' (Hyland 2012) of initiating a
   sentence with an imperative for various strategic purposes that are
   discipline-specific. Such insights have implications for writing
   instructors and materials designers in both L1 and L2 contexts.},

Abstract = {A speaker who issues a confirming turn starting with particles like yes,
   oui, ja, and so on, may mean to extend it and provide further material.
   This study shows that French and German speakers employ the same
   phonetic contrast to indicate the nature of that turn continuation. In
   spite of the typological difference between the German use of
   glottalization and the French use of linking phenomena for word
   boundaries involving word-initial vowels, speakers of both languages
   exploit this contrast systematically in their design of multiunit turns.
   Initial confirmations are joined directly to subsequent vowel-fronted
   turn components when speakers respond with an internally cohesive
   multiunit confirming turn. The components are separated by
   glottalization when responses involve multiple actions or departures
   from a trajectory projected by the turn-initial confirmation. This is
   further evidence that sound patterns shape interaction and are not
   solely determined by language-specific phonologies. Data are in French
   and German with English translation.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of cognitive task
   complexity and individual differences in input, processing, and output
   anxiety (IPOA) on L2 narrative production. The participants were
   enrolled in a bilingual secondary educational program. They performed
   two narrative tasks in speech and writing. The participants' level of
   anxiety was assessed using the IPOA scale (MacIntyre and Gardner 1994).
   The results demonstrate that spoken and written modalities are
   influenced differently by anxiety with the impact of output anxiety
   being significantly stronger in speech than in writing. Another
   important finding was that input and processing anxiety had both
   facilitating and debilitating effects on learners' L2 output. As regards
   the effect of task complexity on participants' narratives, the findings
   suggest that the different stages of language production need to be
   taken into account when categorizing tasks on the basis of the cognitive
   load they impose on learners.},

Title = {Assuming Identities Online: Experimental Linguistics Applied to the

Journal = {APPLIED LINGUISTICS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {37},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {50-70},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {This article uses a research project into the online conversations of
   sex offenders and the children they abuse to further the arguments for
   the acceptability of experimental work as a research tool for linguists.
   The research reported here contributes to the growing body of work
   within linguistics that has found experimental methods to be useful in
   answering questions about representation and constraints on linguistic
   expression (Hemforth 2013). The wider project examines online identity
   assumption in online paedophile activity and the policing of such
   activity, and involves dealing with the linguistic analysis of highly
   sensitive sexual grooming transcripts. Within the linguistics portion of
   the project, we examine theories of idiolect and identity through
   analysis of the `talk' of perpetrators of online sexual abuse, and of
   the undercover officers that must assume alternative identities in order
   to investigate such crimes. The essential linguistic question in this
   article is methodological and concerns the applicability of experimental
   work to exploration of online identity and identity disguise. Although
   we touch on empirical questions, such as the sufficiency of linguistic
   description that will enable convincing identity disguise, we do not
   explore the experimental results in detail. In spite of the preference
   within a range of discourse analytical paradigms for `naturally
   occurring' data, we argue that not only does the term prove conceptually
   problematic, but in certain contexts, and particularly in the applied
   forensic context described, a rejection of experimentally elicited data
   would limit the possible types and extent of analyses. Thus, it would
   restrict the contribution that academic linguistics can make in
   addressing a serious social problem.},

Year = {2016},
Volume = {110},
Number = {1},
Pages = {18-30},

Abstract = {This article proposes a conception of freedom understood as practices.
   Based on Michel Foucault's work on the ethics of the self, I develop a
   conception of freedom that exceeds liberation and distinguishes between
   genuine practices of freedom and practices of the self that are
   unreflective responses to systems of government. I develop and
   illustrate this conception through an engagement with the recent French
   ban on full veils in public spaces and the ethnographic literature on
   European Muslim revival movements. I reconstruct how Muslim women relate
   to alternative discourses through specific practices of the self. These
   practices reveal that French Muslim women actively contest discourses of
   secularism and liberation that construct them as inherently passive and
   in need of tutelage. The conception I develop sheds light on some
   shortcomings of Philip Pettit's notion of freedom as nondomination. I
   argue that the proposed account is useful to, first, criticize the
   centrality of the opposition between arbitrary and nonarbitrary power in
   the definition of freedom. Second, I show that the predominant
   engagement with the external dimension of freedom in Pettit makes it
   difficult to capture the particular subjective practices that make up
   freedom and its development in the presence of power and/or attempts at
   domination.},

   censored, immigrants exposed to Western reports became more critical of
   their home government's performance and decreased their trust in
   official discourse. Conversely, on issues that are relatively open to
   independent reporting, immigrants did not become more critical of
   government performance, and their trust in official discourse maintained
   after being exposed to Western information.},

Volume = {33},
Number = {4},
Pages = {583-604},
Abstract = {The clear financial benefits accrued to owners of television stations as
   a result of the Citizens United v. Federal Elections Commission (FEC)
   decision opens the door to an important question: Did the degree to
   which media corporations benefited from the changes in campaign finance
   law influence their news outlets' coverage of the Citizens United
   decision? In other words, is it possible to identify variation in how
   media outlets covered the Supreme Court decision that correlates with
   the degree to which those outlets' parent companies profited from the
   resulting increase in campaign spending? Answering this question will
   provide an important and much-too-uncommon opportunity to systematically
   test for bias in news coverage. Replicating the method used by Gilens
   and Hertzman (2000) in their own test of coverage of the 1996
   Telecommunications Act, this analysis reveals that newspapers belonging
   to media corporations that own more television stations covered the
   Citizens United ruling systematically differentlyand more favorablythan
   those with few or no television stations. This has important
   implications for the degree to which the news produced by increasingly
   conglomerated and corporatized media companies may eschew neutral or
   balanced coverage in favor of news frames that promote their own
   financial interests.},

   from work on banal and everyday nationalism, collective rituals,
   national identity, and commemorative struggles with survey-based
   findings from political psychology, I demonstrate that meanings attached
   to the nation vary within and across populations as well as over time,
   with important implications for microinteraction and for political
   beliefs and behavior, including support for exclusionary policies and

Journal = {ADMINISTRATIVE SCIENCE QUARTERLY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {60},
Number = {4},
Pages = {561-595},

Abstract = {This study examines how actors from diverse and competing social groups
   can come to identify as members of a common market rather than as agents
   of their discrete social groups. Using data on new-investor recruitment
   into Kenya's nascent capital market, the Nairobi Securities Exchange,
   from 2005 through 2008, I identified mechanisms driving social
   segmentation as well as integration of disparate groups. The empirical
   context is characterized by weak formal institutions and high levels of
   inter-ethnic distrust, a novel but productive setting for studying how
   potential adopters use social identities to resolve uncertainty around
   expected gains of participating in a new market. Results show that
   instead of exhibiting blanket influence by homophilous peers, potential
   investors were positively influenced by profits earned by proximate
   coethnic peers primarily when their own exposure to corrupt financial
   organizations was higher but were negatively influenced by the profits
   of ethnic outsiders when the market was identified with distrusted
   political rivals. Several mechanisms moderated this pattern of distrust,
   including inter-ethnic residential and religious integration but
   especially the use of national language rather than ethnic language
   advertising campaigns, which reframed the market as a shared social
   identity. Findings indicate that the negative effects of social
   segmentation, including the distorting influences of dissimilar peers
   and environmental factors such as political tensions and distrust in
   institutions, can be reversed when potential investors learn about new
   market opportunities from neutral third parties or when policy makers
   frame such practices in socially neutral language.},

Abstract = {I examine the impact federal appellate courts have on state policy
   diffusion through the use of computational text analysis. Using a dyadic
   framework, I model the impact courts have on the decision to adopt a
   policy and, if adopted, how much text to borrow directly from another
   state's preexisting law. A court decision ruling a statute
   unconstitutional can generate up to a 28\% relative reduction in the
   probability of adoption, and a ruling of constitutionality can both
   increase the probability of adoption by a similar amount and more than
   double the amount of borrowed text. These findings shed light on how
   states learn from one another.},

Abstract = {Does external monitoring improve democratic performance? Fact-checking
   has come to play an increasingly important role in political coverage in
   the United States, but some research suggests it may be ineffective at
   reducing public misperceptions about controversial issues. However,
   fact-checking might instead help improve political discourse by
   increasing the reputational costs or risks of spreading misinformation
   for political elites. To evaluate this deterrent hypothesis, we
   conducted a field experiment on a diverse group of state legislators
   from nine U.S. states in the months before the November 2012 election.
   In the experiment, a randomly assigned subset of state legislators was
   sent a series of letters about the risks to their reputation and
   electoral security if they were caught making questionable statements.
   The legislators who were sent these letters were substantially less
   likely to receive a negative fact-checking rating or to have their
   accuracy questioned publicly, suggesting that fact-checking can reduce
   inaccuracy when it poses a salient threat.},

Volume = {109},

Abstract = {Somewhat paradoxically, numerous scholars in various disciplines have
   found that religion induces negative attitudes towards immigrants, while
   others find that it fuels feelings of compassion. We offer a framework
   that accounts for this discrepancy. Using two priming experiments
   conducted among American Catholics, Turkish Muslims, and Israeli Jews,
   we disentangle the role of religious social identity and religious
   belief, and differentiate among types of immigrants based on their
   ethnic and religious similarity to, or difference from, members of the
   host society. We find that religious social identity increases
   opposition to immigrants who are dissimilar to in-group members in
   religion or ethnicity, while religious belief engenders welcoming
   attitudes toward immigrants of the same religion and ethnicity,
   particularly among the less conservative devout. These results suggest
   that different elements of the religious experience exert distinct and
   even contrasting effects on immigration attitudes, manifested in both
   the citizenry's considerations of beliefs and identity and its
   sensitivity to cues regarding the religion of the target group.},

Abstract = {This study investigates how transnational women construct their social
   relations by telling stories in a lingua franca environment (Firth
   1996). My main interest lies in naturally occurring and interactionally
   achieved stories (Bamberg 2004; Georgakopoulou 2007) told during break
   time of an adult English as a Second Language (ESL) class in Honolulu. I
   investigate how seven learners find common ground for belonging by
   telling stories as a means of active participation. The process of
   cultural belonging and participation is examined by way of narrative
   analysis-a concrete, visible, and discursive method for analyzing
   participants' daily interactions. By utilizing the dimensions of
   storytelling, which are embeddedness, tellership, and tellability (Ochs
   and Capps 2001; Georgakopoulou 2007) I seek to examine how the women
   construct their social relations and what social actions and goals their
   stories produce in the interaction. The women locate common concerns and
   complaints, using their stories to build a familiar, safe, and
   comfortable environment in which to practice their new lingua franca.},

Abstract = {Because of its global status, donors and states promote English for
   economic development of countries in the global South such as
   Bangladesh. Governments, donors, and western leaders propose that people
   in madrasas (Islamic educational institutes) should learn English for
   development and security. But voices from madrasas are little heard.
   Based on a linguistic ethnography, this article presents some of these
   neglected perspectives on English for development at a private and
   unreformed Qawmi madrasa in rural Bangladesh. The findings show that
   people in the madrasa from a reflexively traditional stance, reject
   economic progress and western development programmes, and largely resist
   English as a language of development. These positions are considerably
   shaped by their commitments to religion and Arabic, supporting their
   alternative language and development visions. This article, based on the
   findings and drawing on Southern theory, interrogates the promotion of
   English for development, and asks how alert it is to heterogenous and
   complex southern realities.},

Abstract = {Active engagement in interactions is crucial for the development of
   identity, social competence, and cognitive abilities. For children with
   severe speech impairment (SSI) who have little or no intelligible
   speech, active participation in conversations is challenging and can be
   critical for their social inclusion and participation. The present study
   investigated the conversational patterns emerging from interactions
   between children with SSI who use aided communication and typically
   speaking conversation partners (CPs) and explored whether active
   participation was different in interactions with different numbers of
   partners (dyadic versus multi-person interactions). An unusually large
   multilingual dataset was used (N= 85 conversations). This allowed us to
   systematically investigate discourse analysis measures indicating
   participation: the distribution of conversational control (initiations
   versus responses versus recodes) and summoning power (obliges versus
   comments). The findings suggest that (i) conversations were
   characterized by asymmetrical conversational patterns with CPs assuming
   most of the conversational control and (ii) multi-person interactions
   were noticeably more symmetric compared to dyadic, as children's active
   participation in multi-person interactions was significantly increased.
   Clinical implications and best practice recommendations are discussed.},

Title = {Robots in the News and Newsrooms: Unpacking Meta-Journalistic Discourse
   on the Use of Artificial Intelligence in Journalism},
Journal = {DIGITAL JOURNALISM},
Abstract = {As journalism has grappled with the potentials and boundaries of AI
   within the industry, journalists have produced plentiful articles
   detailing experimentation and potential consequences of AI-driven
   journalism (see, Peiser, 2019; GPT-33, 2020). Accordingly, this article
   analyzes media coverage (N = 95 articles) of AI in journalism over a
   5-year period, starting in 2016 and ending in 2020, to examine prominent
   themes related to uses, roles, and concerns regarding AI in the
   newsroom. We sample coverage from 20 US and UK news media outlets
   representing a diversity of media with regards to media type and
   partisan leaning. We employ a thematic analysis on the media coverage of
   AI as it relates specifically to its use and application in journalism.
   Our exploration uncovers a tension between the industry and profession
   of journalism in highlighting the hopes and pitfalls of AI. It also
   allows for a discussion on assessing the place of AI in news making,
   especially with regard to the economic and contextual complexity in
   which news stories operate and the normative ideals of journalism in the
   digital era.},

Title = {How Disinformation Reshaped the Relationship between Journalism and

Journal = {DIGITAL JOURNALISM},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Number = {5},

Month = {JUN 14},
Abstract = {The fight against rampant disinformation has triggered two major
   answers: fact-checking and news literacy. These affect the established
   fields of journalism and of Media and Information Literacy (MIL). They
   create opportunities for new entrants from the margins to enter
   professional fields in need of revamping. Using information and
   communication sciences research on policy and organizations and on the
   interplay between agency, platforms and networks, this analysis focuses
   on three main criteria for evaluating the field-configuring role of
   disinformation: policy rules and professional canons (to regain some
   lost political and economic ground), key events and projects (to provide
   sense-making strategies), and interactions with audiences and
   communities (to restore trust and reputation). Focusing on the European
   Union as main terrain of analysis due to its pioneering initiatives,
   this analysis first considers the mutual benefits afforded by the fight
   against disinformation. Then considers three main challenges: MIL risks
   being reduced to news literacy, digital journalism risks being reduced
   to fact-checking, and the disinformation discourse risks downscaling the
   emphasis on information. It concludes with the implications for the
   future for all actors to effect real field change in MIL and journalism.},

Title = {Translanguaging in a Context of Colonized Education: The Case of EFL
   Classrooms for Arabic Speakers in Israel},
Journal = {APPLIED LINGUISTICS},
Abstract = {Previous studies of translanguaging in educational contexts indicate
   that translanguaging practices have the potential to generate a
   decolonial, emancipatory process for language-minoritized students.
   However, these insights are mainly based on studies of minoritized
   learners of English as a second language. Drawing on a one-year
   ethnographic study conducted in six Palestinian schools in Northern
   Israel, the present study investigated the effects of translanguaging in
   a conflict-ridden context, where both the teachers and the learners are
   minoritized and English is learned as a foreign language. Drawing upon
   concept of implicit censorship and linguistic citizenship, we propose
   colonized education as a framework for understanding the tensions
   between translanguaging, as a decolonial pedagogy, and English language
   learning. Our findings suggest that while translanguaging may indeed
   have a liberatory force, it could also, at the same time, take an
   emotional-pedagogic toll that may hinder language learning rather than
   support it. In contrast, critical discussions of issues that are
   politically and emotionally laden may be highly effective, even when
   conducted in the target language.},

Title = {The Effect of Gender on Interruptions at Congressional Hearings},
Journal = {AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},
Abstract = {Women in Congress are highly effective legislators. Yet, if women are
   more likely than men to be interrupted during committee work, they may
   face a gender-related impediment. We examine speech patterns during more
   than 24,000 congressional committee hearings from 1994 to 2018 to
   determine whether women Members are more likely to be interrupted than
   men. We find that they are. This is especially true in Senate
   committees-where women are about 10\% more likely to be interrupted.
   Furthermore, in hearings that discuss women's issues, women are more
   than twice as likely to be interrupted than while discussing other
   issues. We see a similar pattern for rapid-fire ``interruption
   clusters,{''} an aggressive form of interruption. We further consider a
   range of moderating factors, which yields little evidence that women
   change their communication strategy as they gain experience in Congress.
   We also find suggestive evidence that interruptions are driven by
   mixed-gender interactions.},

   Checks},
Journal = {POLITICAL ANALYSIS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {30},
Number = {2},
Pages = {289-297},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Participants that complete online surveys and experiments may be
   inattentive, which can hinder researchers' abilityto draw substantive or
   causal inferences. As such, many practitioners include multiple
   factualor instructional closed-ended manipulation checks to identify
   low-attention respondents. However, closed-ended manipulation checks are
   either correct or incorrect, which allows participants to more easily
   guess and it reduces the potential variation in attention between
   respondents. In response to these shortcomings, I develop an automatic
   and standardized methodology to measure attention that relies on the
   text that respondents provide in an open-ended manipulation check. There
   are multiple benefits to this approach. First, it provides a continuous
   measure of attention, which allows for greater variation between
   respondents. Second, it reduces the reliance on subjective, paid humans
   to analyze open-ended responses. Last, I outline how to diagnose the
   impact of inattentive workers on the overall results, including how to
   assess the average treatment effect of those respondents that likely
   received the treatment. I provide easy-to-use software in R to implement
   these suggestions for open-ended manipulation checks.},

Title = {Embodied Prosodic Training Helps Improve Accentedness and Suprasegmental
   Accuracy},
Journal = {APPLIED LINGUISTICS},
Abstract = {With increasing evidence in favour of embodied learning techniques, more
   research is needed to explore eventual applications in the field of
   second language acquisition, for example, the effect of embodied
   training on phonological learning. This study investigated how
   pronunciation was affected by visuospatial hand gestures depicting
   speech rhythm and intonation during the oral repetition of logatomes
   (i.e. a series of identical nonsense CV syllables that maintain prosodic
   structure intact). Seventy-five Catalan learners of French participated
   in three training sessions with short dialogues, in one of three
   conditions: speech-only, non-embodied logatome, and embodied logatome.
   Before and after the training period, participants carried out an
   identical pre- and posttest which consisted of reading four dialogues
   aloud. Their oral output was evaluated in terms of fluency,
   comprehensibility, accentedness, and suprasegmental and segmental
   features by three native French speakers. While all three groups
   significantly improved in all measures after training, the embodied
   logatome group improved significantly more in terms of accentedness and
   suprasegmental features compared with the speech-only group, while the
   non-embodied logatome group did not.},

Title = {Where or Nowhere? Tracking Elusive Journalistic Guidelines for Ethical
   Use of Location Data},
Journal = {DIGITAL JOURNALISM},
Abstract = {Locative data is data that identifies a person's precise location in a
   specific moment in time, allowing for evidence-based interpretations of
   who was doing what, when and where. Such tracking already happens
   regularly as a part of ubiquitous smartphone use. In journalistic
   contexts, with relative ease, this data can provide detailed
   documentation about events - connecting people, actions, and settings -
   in unprecedented thoroughness and complexity, even without informed
   consent. Locative data also can create significant threats to personal
   privacy, legal due process, and ethical norms along the way. To
   determine how journalists, conceptualize the emergence and power of
   locative data, this research turns to organizational codes of ethics, as
   representative of public discourse in the field. This content analysis
   explored such discourse in more than 50 major U.S. news organizations,
   including examinations of public policies and terms of service. This
   analysis shows that fewer than half of the largest U.S. news
   organizations even publicly share a code of ethics, conveying
   transparency and leadership issues throughout the field. The
   implications of this research also highlight the lack of clear policies
   and guidelines for how such data should be handled, protected, and
   ethically used by journalists.},

Title = {New Methods for Tracking Development of Sociophonetic Competence:
   Exploring a Preference Task for Spanish /d/ Deletion},
Journal = {APPLIED LINGUISTICS},
Abstract = {Beyond language use, an important component of communicative competence
   is the ability to attend to sociolinguistic variation in the input,
   which requires knowledge regarding when to expect a particular form over
   another variant according to linguistic or extralinguistic factors. This
   study explores the acquisition of sociophonetic competence, employing a
   novel contextualized preference task with an aural component to examine
   second language (L2) learners' knowledge of variable Spanish /d/
   deletion-a sociolinguistic phenomenon constrained by linguistic, social,
   and contextual factors-regardless of whether learners produce the
   deleted variant in their speech. Fifty learners completed a background
   questionnaire, an elicited imitation task, and the contextualized
   preference task. Learners' preference for a deleted variant tended to
   increase as proficiency level increased, as did sensitivity to variables
   previously shown to constrain native speaker patterns of variation,
   including speaker gender, surrounding phonetic context, and grammatical
   category of the lexical item containing /d/. Overall, findings suggest
   that this contextualized preference task provides an additional tool for
   accessing evidence of learners' developing sociophonetic awareness,
   tapping an important skill as learners build communicative competence.},

Abstract = {This study explores how the lexical hesitator koo is used to initiate or
   continue word searches in Japanese talk-in-interaction. The word koo
   ({''}like this,{''} ``in this manner{''}) is canonically used as a
   proximal demonstrative adverb of manner, often accompanied by a
   depicting gesture. We argue that because of its continuity with the
   canonical use, the hesitator koo (a) projects a descriptive term as a
   possible search outcome, and (b) indicates difficulty in describing in
   words what the speaker wants to say. In addition to initiating or
   continuing a search, the hesitator koo provides information about the
   type and nature of the resolution of search, thereby enhancing the
   intersubjectivity of the search process. This study contributes to our
   understanding of the organization of self-initiated same-turn repair by
   identifying the function of a particular lingistic resource used for it.

Title = {Harassment of Journalists and Its Aftermath: Anti-Press Violence,
   Psychological Suffering, and an Internal Chilling Effect},
Journal = {DIGITAL JOURNALISM},
Abstract = {Anti-press sentiment based on negative emotions of disgust and hatred
   has prevailed in Korea since the mid-2010s. Through in-depth interviews
   with ten journalists working for Korean news organizations, supplemented
   with an analysis of self-reflective articles, this study investigates
   how journalists experience this audience hostility and harassment, how
   they cope with it, and how their practices are influenced by it. The
   analysis reveals that, combined with the dualistic views of populist
   politics and the influence of misogynic narratives, journalists who
   cover topics, such as politics and gender, are more likely to become
   targets of anti-press violence. Moreover, it shows that anti-press
   violence induces negative emotions, such as discomfort, anger, lethargy,
   and fear, among journalists. To cope with these emotions, with little
   support from their news organizations, journalists tend to pursue
   emotion-focused coping strategies, such as striving for perfection in
   the newswork process, building emotional boundaries between the audience
   and themselves, counter-hating readers, and blaming other journalists.
   Finally, the paper suggests that anti-press violence in Korea promotes a
   chilling effect in news organizations that, consequently, may infringe
   on individual journalists' autonomy and editorial independence.},

Abstract = {To analyze intersecting power relations in reproductive and immigration
   politics, I examine Garza v. Hargan (an appellate case regarding
   unaccompanied immigrant minors' abortion rights) alongside systemic
   injustices in immigration detention (e.g., exposure to miscarriage
   risks, coerced sterilization, shackling). These injustices, I argue,
   emerge from conflicts and compromises over fetal citizenship within the
   American radical right. Although pro-life and anti-immigrant discourses
   assume opposing logics of citizenship, respectively interpreting
   immigrants' fetuses as ``fetal citizens{''} or ``anchor babies,{''}
   these contradictions are neutralized by two techniques. Debilitation
   (systematic degradation of a disposable population) enables the
   appearance of fetal protection to coexist with de facto exposure to
   death, injury, and risk. Paralegality (quasi-legal policy making by
   enforcement agents) allows situational shifts in the meaning of fetal
   citizenship and adjustments to the pro-life/anti-immigrant compromise.
   Both obscure culpability for reproductive injustice, reinforce
   interlocking oppressions, and control women's bodies in order to control
   the body politic's demographic future.},

Abstract = {What are the origins of the ethnic landscapes in contemporary states?
   Drawing on a preregistered research design, we test the influence of
   dual socioeconomic revolutions that spread throughout Africa during the
   nineteenth and twentieth centuries-export agriculture and print
   technologies. We argue these changes transformed ethnicity via their
   effects on politicization and boundary-making. Print technologies
   strengthened imagined communities, leading to more salient-yet
   porous-ethnic identities. Cash crop endowments increased groups'
   mobilizational potential but with more exclusionary boundaries to
   control agricultural rents. Using historical data on cash crops and
   African language publications, we find that groups exposed to these
   historical forces are more likely to be politically relevant in the
   postindependence period, and their members report more salient ethnic
   identities. We observe heterogenous effects on boundary-making as
   measured by interethnic marriage; relative to cash crops, printing
   fostered greater openness to assimilate linguistically related
   outsiders. Our findings illuminate not only the historical sources of
   ethnic politicization but also mechanisms shaping boundary formation.},

Title = {Benefits of Diverse News Recommendations for Democracy: A User Study},
Journal = {DIGITAL JOURNALISM},
Abstract = {News recommender systems provide a technological architecture that helps
   shaping public discourse. Following a normative approach to news
   recommender system design, we test utility and external effects of a
   diversity-aware news recommender algorithm. In an experimental study
   using a custom-built news app, we show that diversity-optimized
   recommendations (1) perform similar to methods optimizing for user
   preferences regarding user utility, (2) that diverse news
   recommendations are related to a higher tolerance for opposing views,
   especially for politically conservative users, and (3) that diverse news
   recommender systems may nudge users towards preferring news with
   differing or even opposing views. We conclude that diverse news
   recommendations can have a depolarizing capacity for democratic
   societies.},

Abstract = {Patient-Centered Outcomes Research (PCOR), rooted in the more
   established tradition of Community-Based Participatory Research
   (Deeb-Sossa 2019), seeks to empower patients in determining the most
   appropriate healthcare options by including and amplifying their voices
   in every aspect of the research process. In this article, we report on
   the outcomes of a four-year PCOR engagement effort in the US Midwest
   that aimed to include and amplify patient voices in language in
   healthcare policy. Our findings revealed feelings of patient
   disempowerment, discomfort with the social distance created by remote
   interpreting, and a mismatch of knowledge and expectations among
   interlocutors in medical interactions. Our discussions also underscored
   women's work in addressing healthcare issues within the family and their
   resilience in describing systemic inequities in health communication. We
   argue that participation in PCOR empowers patients through the enactment
   of testimonial justice. We conclude by discussing implications and
   recommendations for language researchers who are interested in working
   toward social justice in language in healthcare policy in USA and
   building a multi-stakeholder platform for PCOR.},

Abstract = {While applied linguistics research can serve as an important site for
   understanding and contributing to efforts toward challenging historical
   and contemporary power structures, it is also crucial to interrogate how
   numerous normative concepts and logics within the field of applied
   linguistics both reflect and reenact dominant power structures.
   Centering colonialism and racism in our analysis, this commentary
   considers how applied linguistics often focuses on modest reforms
   supporting affirmation and inclusion of marginalized populations and
   practices, rather than on fundamental institutional changes required to
   eradicate the forces that produce marginalization. As applied linguists
   grapple with questions surrounding the extent to which their work
   contributes in substantive ways to social justice struggles, we are
   inspired by collaborations that challenge us to reconsider normative
   assumptions about both language and justice. These collaborations demand
   a comprehensive reckoning that frames social justice not as a normative
   reality that can be achieved through modest reforms to liberal
   governance, but rather as an existential horizon that necessitates a
   fundamental reimagination of communication's role in narrating and
   creating decolonial worlds that sustain collective well-being.},

Title = {`Who Is My Research for?': Researcher Perceptions of the
   Research-Practice Relationship},
Journal = {APPLIED LINGUISTICS},
Abstract = {This study investigated second language (L2) researchers' perceptions of
   the research-practice relationship. While research use (or lack thereof)
   in the classroom has been debated by researchers for decades,
   researchers have rarely investigated themselves as stakeholders in the
   relationship. However, it is vital to know researchers' approaches to
   the issue so that collaborative researcher-practitioner relationships
   may be fostered. Hence, the current survey study explored: (a) L2
   researchers' identities; (b) their perceptions of the research-practice
   relationship; and (c) predictors of their perceptions. Participants were
   217 researchers from 25 countries with 31 different first-language
   backgrounds. The results showed that L2 researchers' identities often
   crossed multiple boundaries, as L2 learners, teachers, as well as
   researchers. A factor analysis showed that researchers held distinct
   beliefs for their own research (individual self) and for researchers in
   general (collective self). The regression models revealed that L2
   teaching experience, pre-service teacher training experience, and
   institutional rewards positively predicted researchers' perceptions of
   L2 practice. We argue that it is largely researchers' responsibility to
   facilitate the research-practice dialogue.},

   Insights from an Intensive Longitudinal Intervention Study},
Journal = {APPLIED LINGUISTICS},
Abstract = {Second language (L2) learning has been promoted as a promising
   intervention to stave off age-related cognitive decline. While previous
   studies based on mean trends showed inconclusive results, this study is
   the first to investigate nonlinear cognitive trajectories across a
   30-week training period. German-speaking older participants (aged 64-75
   years) enrolled for a Spanish course, strategy game training (active
   control) or movie screenings (passive control). We assessed cognitive
   performance in working memory, alertness, divided attention, and verbal
   fluency on a weekly basis. Trajectories were modeled using Generalized
   Additive Mixed Models to account for temporally limited transfer effects
   and intra-individual variation in cognitive performance. Our results
   provide no evidence of cognitive improvement differing between the
   Spanish and either of the control groups during any phase of the
   training period. We did, however, observe an effect of baseline
   cognition, such that individuals with low cognitive baselines increased
   their performance more in the L2 group than comparable individuals in
   the control groups. We discuss these findings against the backdrop of
   the cognitive training literature and Complex Dynamic Systems Theory.},

Abstract = {We investigate how sociology students garner recognition from niche
   field audiences through specialization. Our dataset comprises over
   80,000 sociology-related dissertations completed at U.S. universities,
   as well as data on graduates' pursuant publications. We analyze
   different facets of how students specialize-topic choice, focus,
   novelty, and consistency. To measure specialization types within a
   consistent methodological frame, we utilize structural topic modeling.
   These measures capture specialization strategies used at an early career
   stage. We connect them to a crucial long-term outcome in academia:
   becoming an advisor. Event-history models reveal that specific topic
   choices and novel combinations exhibit a positive influence, whereas
   focused theses make no substantial difference. In particular, theses
   related to the cultural turn, methods, or race are tied to academic
   careers that lead to mentorship. Thematic consistency of students'
   publication track also has a strong positive effect on the chances of
   becoming an advisor. Yet, there are diminishing returns to consistency
   for highly productive scholars, adding important nuance to the
   well-known imperative of publish or perish in academic careers.},

Journal = {LEADERSHIP QUARTERLY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {32},
Number = {6},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The past few decades have witnessed numerous crises that have drawn
   increasing attention to the study of cri-sis leadership. However,
   research in this field remains fragmented and existing reviews often
   adopt a subjective approach to identify and synthesize the findings of
   relevant articles. These limitations make it difficult for scholars to
   appreciate the progress made in the literature, to derive comprehensive
   and objective insights, and to forge a path ahead. This study
   synthesizes theoretical insights and empirical findings in the crisis
   lead-ership literature using bibliometric techniques. We first review
   the intellectual structure of the crisis leadership literature by
   conducting co-citation and bibliographic coupling analyses. We then map
   the major conceptual themes in the crisis leadership literature via a
   co-word analysis. To supplement the findings of the bibliometric
   analyses, we review the key methodological approaches adopted by crisis
   leadership researchers. Based on the integrative insights, we propose a
   research agenda highlighting opportunities for theoretical and
   methodolog-ical advancements in crisis leadership research.},

Journal = {APPLIED LINGUISTICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {43},
Number = {3},
Pages = {473-492},
Month = {JUN 2},
Abstract = {Active engagement in interactions is crucial for the development of
   identity, social competence, and cognitive abilities. For children with
   severe speech impairment (SSI) who have little or no intelligible
   speech, active participation in conversations is challenging and can be
   critical for their social inclusion and participation. The present study
   investigated the conversational patterns emerging from interactions
   between children with SSI who use aided communication and typically
   speaking conversation partners (CPs) and explored whether active
   participation was different in interactions with different numbers of
   partners (dyadic versus multi-person interactions). An unusually large
   multilingual dataset was used (N= 85 conversations). This allowed us to
   systematically investigate discourse analysis measures indicating
   participation: the distribution of conversational control (initiations
   versus responses versus recodes) and summoning power (obliges versus
   comments). The findings suggest that (i) conversations were
   characterized by asymmetrical conversational patterns with CPs assuming
   most of the conversational control and (ii) multi-person interactions
   were noticeably more symmetric compared to dyadic, as children's active
   participation in multi-person interactions was significantly increased.
   Clinical implications and best practice recommendations are discussed.},

Title = {What Was the Point of Equality?},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Abstract = {Political theorists often turn to seventeenth-century England and the
   Levellers as sources of egalitarian insight. Yet by the time the
   Levellers were active, the claim that human beings were ``equal{''} by
   nature was commonplace. Why, in Leveller hands, did a long-standing
   piety consistent with social hierarchy became suddenly effectual?
   Inspired by Elizabeth Anderson, this article explores what equality-and
   the related concept of parity-meant for the Levellers, and what ``the
   point,{''} as they saw it, was. I argue that the Levellers' key
   achievement was subsuming a highly controversial premise of natural
   parity within the existing language of natural equality. This suggests
   that modern basic equality is the product of two, potentially
   contradictory, principles. This, in turn, has important normative, as
   well as historical and conceptual, implications for how theorists
   understand ``the point{''} of equality for egalitarian movements today.},

Month = {JUN 2},
Abstract = {Because of its global status, donors and states promote English for
   economic development of countries in the global South such as
   Bangladesh. Governments, donors, and western leaders propose that people
   in madrasas (Islamic educational institutes) should learn English for
   development and security. But voices from madrasas are little heard.
   Based on a linguistic ethnography, this article presents some of these
   neglected perspectives on English for development at a private and
   unreformed Qawmi madrasa in rural Bangladesh. The findings show that
   people in the madrasa from a reflexively traditional stance, reject
   economic progress and western development programmes, and largely resist
   English as a language of development. These positions are considerably
   shaped by their commitments to religion and Arabic, supporting their
   alternative language and development visions. This article, based on the
   findings and drawing on Southern theory, interrogates the promotion of
   English for development, and asks how alert it is to heterogenous and
   complex southern realities.},

Title = {News Coverage of the Arab Spring: State-Run News Agencies as Discursive
   Propagators of News},
Journal = {DIGITAL JOURNALISM},
Abstract = {We explore the official state news agencies' digital platforms of 10
   Arab countries depict the ``Arab Spring.{''} We argue that these
   agencies serve as ``discursive propagators{''} because their outreach is
   widespread throughout the media ecosystem and are regarded as one of the
   only official sources of news on the protest movements in these
   respective countries. This article makes two main original contributions
   to the field of digital journalism. First, it introduces the theoretical
   concept of discursive propagators that addresses the often neglected
   information impact of state-run news agencies operating in authoritarian
   states and their influence on other news media. By examining this seldom
   studied area of news production in the region, we are able to glean some
   news content that has the potential of influencing Arabic news media.
   Second, the study examines a unique Arabic language dataset and analyzes
   it using topic modelling and other digital approaches that are not often
   employed in the analysis of Arabic news. The analysis of digital state
   news agency coverage is contextualized to provide more insight into this
   digital type of content that often sets the tone of local journalistic
   production about the Arab Spring and other politically sensitive issues.},

Journal = {RESEARCH ON LANGUAGE AND SOCIAL INTERACTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {54},
Number = {4},
Pages = {355-373},
Month = {OCT 2},
Abstract = {Rhetorical questions have been regularly observed to implement
   disaffiliative actions in conversations such as challenging,
   complaining, or retorting. This article, however, reports on
   nondisaffiliative uses of rhetorical questions based on a particular
   structure in Mandarin, bushi horizontal ellipsis ma, which can serve as
   a conventional question, a disaffiliative rhetorical question, or a
   nondisaffiliative rhetorical question. Although much less studied,
   nondisaffiliative uses are by far more frequent in conversations.
   Integrating discourse-functional linguistics and conversation analysis,
   this study argues that nondisaffiliative bushi horizontal ellipsis ma
   rhetorical questions work to pursue common ground so as to move the
   activity-in-progress forward. Moreover, it examines the sequential
   contexts in which they are recurrently produced and identifies the
   interactional clues-epistemic, sequential, prosodic-that make these
   rhetorical questions recognizable as seeking common ground. This article
   contributes to our understanding of the rhetorical question as a
   grammatical device that maximizes intersubjectivity in conversation,
   further confirming the mutual influence between grammar and social
   interaction. Data are in Mandarin Chinese with English translation.},

   representations of press freedom in their own regions of the world and
   their representations of press freedom in ``Other{''} places? (3) What
   digital strategies do the IPI, CPJ, and RSF use in coverage of the

Abstract = {This paper examines two forms of listening in relation to racism and the
   minority-language context in Catalonia. The research is based on a
   collaboration between twoacademics and RC (Racialised Catalans) which
   started with initial interviews on theireducational experiences and
   trajectories in Catalonia. From there, a collaboration betweenthe
   academics and a inter-cultural, anti-racism group (Junts a pseudonym)
   emerged.First, we analyse the role of the white listening subject in
   which RC are discriminatedagainst for a perceived lack of Catalan.
   Second, we describe how the group made otherslisten through their work.
   Thus, listening results in a form of `undecideability' which
   requireswider society for the possibilities of racial equality.},

Title = {Causal Inference with Latent Treatments},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Abstract = {Social scientists are interested in the effects of low-dimensional
   latent treatments within texts, such as the effect of an attack on a
   candidate in a political advertisement. We provide a framework for
   causal inference with latent treatments in high-dimensional
   interventions. Using this framework, we show that the randomization of
   texts alone is insufficient to identify the causal effects of latent
   treatments, because other unmeasured treatments in the text could
   confound the measured treatment's effect. We provide a set of
   assumptions that is sufficient to identify the effect of latent
   treatments and a set of strategies to make these assumptions more
   plausible, including explicitly adjusting for potentially confounding
   text features and nontraditional experimental designs involving many
   versions of the text. We apply our framework to a survey experiment and
   an observational study, demonstrating how our framework makes text-based
   causal inferences more credible.},

Title = {Between Journalistic and Movement Logic: Disentangling Referencing
   Practices of Right-Wing Alternative Online News Media},
Journal = {DIGITAL JOURNALISM},
Abstract = {The article analyzes the in-article referencing practices of right-wing
   alternative online news media. It distinguishes between a journalistic
   logic, in which referencing practices follow established journalistic
   ways of ensuring facticity and context, and a movement logic, in which
   references are used to obtain political, movement-oriented goals of
   dismissing opponents, supporting your allies, multiplying forces and
   building a community. Based on a manual quantitative content analysis of
   more than 4,500 references extracted from 1,000 randomly selected
   articles by 20 right-wing alternative news media from six countries (US,
   UK, Germany, Austria, Sweden, Denmark), the article shows that
   alternative news media predominantly follow a journalistic logic in
   their referencing practices, though at the expense of a limited
   originality of sources. Despite their anti-mainstream ambition,
   alternative news media frequently refer to mainstream media, but only
   rarely dismiss or re-frame content published by these media. The article
   discusses these practices as an expression of the hybrid nature of
   alternative news media situated at the boundary between journalism and
   political activism. Moreover, it addresses broader implications for the
   relationship between alternative and mainstream journalistic practice in
   the digital realm.},

Title = {Restoring Anahuac: Indigenous Genealogies and Hemispheric Republicanism
   in Postcolonial Mexico},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Abstract = {This article turns to postcolonial Mexico to analyze the importance of
   Indigenous political thought for the transformation of radical
   republicanism during the Age of Revolutions. I argue that Mexican
   insurgents deployed Indigenous genealogies to instantiate what I call
   ``restorative revolution,{''} a form of revolutionary thinking that
   prioritized memorialization over absolute foundation. Mexico's
   restorative project began with calls for the return of the Anahuac
   Empire, an Indigenous genealogy that memorialized histories of popular
   self-rule to legitimize postcolonial demands. I suggest that the Anahuac
   movement transformed the principles of radical republican thought by
   mobilizing around religious, plebeian, and hemispheric identities. Each
   of these characteristics problematizes dominant interpretations of
   republicanism as a secular, elite, and national enterprise. This article
   uses popular objects and archival ephemera to illustrate the importance
   of engaging with the political contributions of marginalized groups from
   the spaces, practice, and languages they used to envision postcolonial
   emancipation in collective terms.},

Abstract = {There is substantial evidence that voters' choices are shaped by
   assessments of the state of the economy and that these assessments, in
   turn, are influenced by the news. But how does the economic news track
   the welfare of different income groups in an era of rising inequality?
   Whose economy does the news cover? Drawing on a large new dataset of US
   news content, we demonstrate that the tone of the economic news strongly
   and disproportionately tracks the fortunes of the richest households,
   with little sensitivity to income changes among the non-rich. Further,
   we present evidence that this pro-rich bias emerges not from pro-rich
   journalistic preferences but, rather, from the interaction of the
   media's focus on economic aggregates with structural features of the
   relationship between economic growth and distribution. The findings
   yield a novel explanation of distributionally perverse electoral
   patterns and demonstrate how distributional biases in the economy
   condition economic accountability.},

Volume = {42},

Abstract = {Recent studies on English-Medium-Instruction (EMI) classroom interaction
   have begun to look at the role of translanguaging as a pedagogical
   practice in supporting participants to exploit multilingual and
   multimodal resources to facilitate content teaching and learning. The
   present study contributes to this growing body of literature by focusing
   on playful talk in multiple languages and modalities in EMI mathematics
   classrooms in a secondary school in Hong Kong. Based on the data
   collected from a linguistic ethnography, we analyze how the teacher
   constructs playful talk in order to achieve various pedagogical goals
   including building rapport, facilitating content explanation and
   promoting meaningful communication with students. The analysis
   demonstrates that translanguaging appears to be a critical resource and
   that several social factors, including the teacher's personal belief,
   history, sociocultural, and pedagogical knowledge, play a role in
   constructing playful talk. The playful talk transforms the classroom
   into a translanguaging space, which in turn allows the teacher and
   students to perform a range of creative acts and experiment with a
   variety of voices to facilitate the meaning making and knowledge
   construction processes.},

Abstract = {We propose a new methodology for inferring political actors' latent
   memberships in communities of collective activity that drive their
   observable interactions. Unlike existing methods, the proposed Bipartite
   Link Community Model (biLCM) (1) applies to two groups of actors, (2)
   takes into account that actors may be members of more than one
   community, and (3) allows a pair of actors to interact in more than one
   way. We apply this method to characterize legislative communities of
   special interest groups and politicians in the 113th U.S. Congress.
   Previous empirical studies of interest group politics have been limited
   by the difficulty of observing the ties between interest groups and
   politicians directly. We therefore first construct an original dataset
   that connects the politicians who sponsor congressional bills with the
   interest groups that lobby on those bills based on more than two million
   textual descriptions of lobbying activities. We then use the biLCM to
   make quantitative measurements of actors' community memberships ranging
   from narrow targeted interactions according to industry interests and
   jurisdictional committee membership to broad multifaceted connections
   across multiple policy domains.},

Abstract = {This special issue features applied linguistics scholarship that
   cultivates relationships for justice. The collection of papers in this
   special issue challenges the field of applied linguistics to move beyond
   an acknowledgement of social inequities (through observation, analysis,
   and critique) toward cultivating relationships for justice (CRJ) - in
   order to undo past harms and collectively imagine more just futures. The
   authors/collaborators demonstrate how building systemic social change
   involves decentering the individual researcher's interests and instead
   foregrounding processes of collective solidarity (Martinez et al. 2021),
   demonstrating how justice is relational and aspirational. In this
   editorial, we discuss the particular contributions of each paper,
   alongside thematic connection points across the articles. Our intention
   in including an editorial, commentaries, and a range of papers is to
   create space for multi-vocality and diverse genres as part of CRJ. We
   conclude with an aspirational call to action for members of our applied
   linguistics academic community.},

Abstract = {In this article, we provide longitudinal evidence for the progressive
   routinization of a grammatical construction used for social coordination
   purposes in a highly specialized activity context: task-oriented
   video-mediated interactions. We focus on the methodic ways in which,
   over the course of 4 years, a second language speaker and initially
   novice to such interactions coordinates the transition between
   interacting with her coparticipants and consulting her own screen, which
   suspends talk, without creating trouble due to halts in progressivity.
   Initially drawing on diverse resources, she increasingly resorts to the
   use of a prospective alert constructed around the verb to check (e.g.,
   ``I will check{''}), which eventually routinizes in the lexically
   specific form ``let me check{''} as a highly context- and activity-bound
   social action format. We discuss how such change over the participant's
   video-mediated interactional history contributes to our understanding of
   social coordination in video-mediated interaction and of participants'
   recalibrating their grammar-for-interaction while adapting to new
   situations, languages, or media. Data are in English.},

Abstract = {The aim of this commentary is to discuss and promote discussion on some
   linguistic and pedagogical issues around the use of gender inclusive
   language, particularly the -e morpheme in plural forms, in Spanish. Its
   speakers are experiencing and becoming aware of language change in real
   time concerning the use of morphosyntactic choices that seek embrace
   gender equality, diversity, representation, and diversity. This language
   change impacts directly on formal education and educational
   administrators who are under pressure not only from different social
   actors but also from their own beliefs on whether they should promote,
   ignore, or mitigate the linguistic changes that society is producing
   through their situated practices. Against this background, to what
   extent are educational authorities professionally prepared to encourage
   academic discussions on inclusive language in education? How can applied
   linguists help? Having these questions as our Southern Cross, our
   commentary lies at the intersection of language change and educational
   authorities' professional knowledge.},

Abstract = {Linguistic ethnographers largely agree that engaging in self-reflexivity
   enables researchers to identify how their actions, subjectivities, and
   motivations influence research. In this article, I argue for a
   discourse-oriented ethnographic account as an alternative method for
   documenting and reporting such reflexivity. The overall goal of this
   article is to examine reflexive research practices in the study of
   tourism communication. Presenting illustrative cases, I closely analyze
   how the researcher's co-presence naturally opens up opportunities for
   some form of intervention in tourist-guide dyads. I show that researcher
   participation that is intended to resolve local interactional problems
   can have unintended consequences resulting in marginalization or
   exclusion of the key participants. The analysis shows that the
   researcher is not only the knowledge-maker in applied linguistics
   research but is also an object of analysis in the process. Overall, the
   study is intended to invite workplace researchers to reflect on whether
   and how much to participate, how their participation shapes
   researcher-participant relationships, how their relationship impacts
   data and knowledge claims, and how issues of balance and distance can be
   negotiated.},

Abstract = {The English-language particle you know is frequently associated with
   speech production and understanding difficulties. The present study
   combines sequential and distributional analyses to explicate the
   particle's relationship to the conversational repair system. It
   demonstrates that you know functions as an adjunct to repair, addressing
   secondary difficulties associated with implementing self-repair in
   practice, while also promoting the avoidance of transformative repair
   operations. This repair adjunct viewpoint trades off the particle's
   general import as an alignment token and is supported by examining its
   specialized role in: (a) self-repair operations, (b) suboptimal
   formulations, and (c) understanding pursuits. This article elaborates
   our understanding of the repair system by identifying an ancillary
   practice that smooths over recurrent shortcomings of natural speech.

Abstract = {Both champions and critics of ``neorealism{''} in contemporary
   international relations misinterpret David Hume as an early spokesman
   for a universal and scientific balance-of-power theory. This article
   instead treats Hume's ``Of the Balance of Power,{''} alongside the other
   essays in his Political Discourses (1752), as conceptual resources for a
   historically inflected analysis of state balancing. Hume's defense of
   the balance of power cannot be divorced from his critique of commercial
   warfare in ``Of the Balance of Trade{''} and ``Of the Jealousy of
   Trade.{''} To better appreciate Hume's historical and economic approach
   to foreign policy, this article places Hume in conversation with
   Machiavelli, Guicciardini, Andrew Fletcher, and Montesquieu.
   International relations scholars suspicious of static paradigms should
   reconsider Hume's genealogy of the balance of power, which differs from
   the standard liberal and neorealist accounts. Well before International
   Political Economy developed as a formal subdiscipline, Hume was
   conceptually treating economics and power politics in tandem.},

Abstract = {The current study investigated advanced L2 learners' linguistic
   development before, during, and after a nine-month stay abroad, the
   extent to which contextual changes (home-abroad-home) influenced the
   nature and magnitude of development, and the ways in which relationships
   among different linguistic elements changed over time. Participants were
   56 university learners majoring in French (n=29) and Spanish (n=27), who
   spent an academic year abroad in the middle of a four-year BA degree
   programme. Oral data were collected six times over 21months to trace
   development and change in complexity, accuracy, fluency, and lexis.
   Results showed ongoing improvements over time on most measures,
   including accuracy. Correlations indicated long-term relationships
   between fluency and vocabulary only and that accuracy-complexity
   relationships emerged in instructed home contexts only. These findings
   suggest that the affordances of home and abroad contexts can shape
   learners' linguistic development and use differently. The role of
   pre-departure linguistic ability is discussed as critical to
   understanding the nature and extent of L2 linguistic development in
   study abroad.},

Abstract = {Role models can exert considerable influence in shaping individuals'
   values, attitudes, and beliefs. A large body of work in the social
   sciences has investigated the influence of celebrity role models, and in
   the context of education, several disciplines have a rich research
   history in this area (e.g. medical education). However, in the context
   of second language acquisition, research centred on role models has
   largely remained on the periphery. This study presents a large-scale
   international survey investigating the role models of English language
   learners. With data collected from 8,472 participants, analysis
   investigated whether these learners had English language role models,
   who the role models were and what characteristics learners valued in
   them, and investigated systematic variation among subgroups. Results
   showed that 68 per cent of respondents reported having an English
   language role model, and four key role model dimensions emerged: overall
   command of English, paralinguistic features, personal attributes and
   accent/variety of English. We argue that role modelling may be a highly
   influential component of the psychological context of second-language
   acquisition, and conclude by highlighting several valuable areas for
   future research.},

Abstract = {This study examines the interpreter role among students who serve as
   interpreters in a community health clinic system in the Midwestern USA
   as part of a community health-themed service-learning course for
   advanced Spanish students. Drawing on Positioning Theory (), I consider
   the ways in which three second language learners and three heritage
   speakers who participated in the program describe their roles as
   interpreters with reference to the Code of Ethics, negotiate their roles
   with the medical students and doctors also serving at the clinic, and
   make sense of moments in which they chose to advocate for the patients,
   or otherwise provide assistance to them, beyond interpreting. Each
   student encountered different types of challenges that reflected their
   individual backgrounds and experiences, and these challenges led to
   reflection, learning, and new perspectives on their roles in providing
   patient care. The article problematizes the role of bilingual student
   interpreters in community health programs and offers recommendations for
   preparing students to provide the highest possible quality of healthcare

Abstract = {This article investigates the connection between multilingual
   experiences and creative metaphoric competence. As multilingualism has
   been shownto bring cognitive advantages in creative thinking, this
   article explores whether the ability to interpret creative metaphors
   differs in participants with less versus more multilingual experience.
   The results of a self-paced reading study combined with a sensicality
   judgment showed that people with less versus more multilingual
   experience process metaphors evaluated as being (i) less or (ii) more
   creative quite similarly in terms of reading times; however, the groups
   differ significantly in their judgments of semantic sensicality for the
   more creative metaphors. Although in the case of less creative metaphors
   groups do not differ, in the case of more creative metaphors, people
   with more multilingual experience are more likely to say that the
   metaphor makes sense. We interpret these findings as showing that people
   with more multilingual experience access the nonsalient semantic
   features of the concepts compared in the metaphor with less effort and
   can employ richer semantic representations, which complements previous
   research on multilingualism and cognitive flexibility.},

Abstract = {Studies of populism have shifted from substantive to
   discursive/performative and institutional perspectives in recent
   decades. This shift resolved some long-standing problems but insulated
   the analysis of populism from theoretical and methodological debates in
   the social sciences. Theoretical restrictions have gone hand in hand
   with geographical neglect: The near-exclusive focus on the United
   States, Europe, and Latin America reinforces the blind spots of these
   existing approaches. An integration of overlooked regions holds the
   potential for theoretical reconstruction, even though such comparative
   broadening could as well simply reproduce the persistent impasses.
   Moreover, post-2016 developments have induced a return to substantive
   issues, throwing into sharp relief what populism studies have been
   missing during the past decades. The main challenge today is
   synthesizing socioeconomic analyses with institutionalist and
   discourse-theoretical advances without falling into eclecticism.
   Breaking away from the entrenched regional orientations to embrace a
   more global-historical methodology could help such an endeavor.},

Abstract = {The use of metrics and analytics is becoming pervasive in newsrooms the
   world over. However, there is a lack of consistent terminology in
   scholarly literature with regards to such practice and a dearth of
   studies that compare practice on a wider scale that prevents more
   holistic understanding of how audience data are being used on the
   newsroom floor. These issues are addressed with the development of a new
   participative gatekeeping model with three previously unidentified
   channels of gatekeeping specifically related to the use of audience
   data: promotional, for the type of short-term gatekeeping done on news
   site homepages that involves tracking real-time metrics to position
   content, often tied to traffic targets; developmental, or longer-term
   strategies that shape future coverage and are grounded in hypotheses of
   audience behaviour gleaned from analytics; and a third more porous
   channel of experimentation where such hypotheses are tested. These
   channels were observed in ethnographic research in six newsrooms in
   three different countries at media outlets with diverse sources of
   revenue: Norway's public broadcaster, NRK; Canada's subscriber-based
   national news agency, The Canadian Press (CP); and two local newsrooms
   working within larger media organizations, The Hamilton Spectator in
   Canada, and The Bournemouth Daily Echo in England. Through a
   sociological lens, this article distinguishes language to best document
   the complex processes interconnected with audience data, identifies
   similarities in practice that override media or revenue systems, and
   explores how the audience, through the participatory mechanisms of
   metrics and analytics, shapes newsroom practice.},

Journal = {AMERICAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW},

Volume = {86},
Number = {1},
Pages = {93-122},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The theory of statistical discrimination is a dominant social scientific
   framework for understanding discrimination in labor markets. To date,
   the literature has treated this theory as a model that merely explains
   employer behavior. This article contends that the idea of statistical
   discrimination, rather than simply providing an explanation, can lead
   people to view social stereotyping as useful and acceptable and thus
   help rationalize and justify discriminatory decisions. A preregistered
   survey experiment with more than 2,000 participants who had managerial
   experience shows that exposure to statistical discrimination theory
   strengthened people's belief in the accuracy of stereotypes, their
   acceptance of stereotyping, and the extent to which they engaged in
   gender discrimination in a hiring simulation. Reading a critical
   commentary on the theory mitigated these effects. These findings imply
   that theories of discrimination, and the language associated with them,
   can rationalize-or challenge the rationality of-stereotypes and
   discrimination and, as a result, shape the attitudes and actions of
   decision-makers in labor markets.},

Abstract = {The study of representation is a major research field in quantitative
   political science. Since the early 2000s, it has been accompanied by a
   range of important conceptual innovations by political theorists working
   on the topic. Yet, although many quantitative scholars are familiar with
   the conceptual literature, even the most complex quantitative studies
   eschew engaging with the ``new wave{''} of more sophisticated concepts
   of representation that theorists have developed. We discuss what we take
   to be the main reasons for this gap between theory and empirics, and
   present four novel conceptions of representation that are both sensitive
   to theorists' conceptual impulses and operationalizable for quantitative
   scholars. In doing so, we advance an alternative research agenda on
   representation that moves significantly beyond the status quo of the
   field.},

Abstract = {Psychological reactance, routinely operationalized as a latent construct
   comprised of anger and negative cognitions, represents an aversive state
   following a threatened or eliminated freedom. The current study sought
   to extend the literature by comparing three distinct measures of
   negative cognitions: (a) trained coder (thought-listing), (b)
   participant coding (thought-listing), and (c) Likert scale. Participants
   (N= 540) were randomly assigned to view messages in a 2 (language:
   forceful and non-forceful) x 3 (topic: exercise, fruit and vegetable
   consumption, and sleep) between subjects factorial design. Exposure to
   forceful (vs. non-forceful) language resulted in higher negative
   cognitions across all three measures. Moreover, all three measures of
   negative cognitions were negatively associated with behavioral
   intention. Three competing structural models were examined, each using a
   different measure of negative cognitions. Results demonstrated the three
   models performed similarly based on comparisons of model fit and
   variance explained. Despite similar performance among the three measures
   of negative cognitions, there was a slight, but consistent advantage for
   the Likert scale measure model in terms of fit, variance explained, and
   factor loadings. Validation of these three measures of negative
   cognitions provides communication researchers with the flexibility to
   choose the measure most appropriate for their needs.},

Abstract = {Many scholars seek contemporary insights from historical texts. Yet such
   efforts often fall short. Some studies do not demonstrate a gap in the
   literature, or they overgeneralize about the limitations of contemporary
   scholarship. Other studies misread contemporary authors or underestimate
   the complexity of contemporary issues. Interestingly, some studies use
   ideas that have been superseded: the history of political thought can
   constrain as well as liberate. Overall, I suggest, some of the boldest
   claims for the contemporary value of the history of political thought
   come from scholars whose own contemporary insights sometimes fall short.
   These problems risk undermining, not underlining, the contemporary
   relevance of the history of political thought. To draw contemporary
   insights from historical texts, we need to grasp how hard this can be.},

Year = {2020},
Volume = {53},
Number = {3},

Month = {JUL 2},
Abstract = {This article examines three practices in responses to polar questions in
   French: prefacing a polar response token (e.g.,oui{[}{''}yes{''}]
   ornon{[}{''}no{''}]) with the particleah(e.g.,ah oui), prefacing with
   the particleben(e.g.,ben oui), and producing more than one token
   (e.g.,oui=oui). The analysis suggests that such responses serve to take
   issue with the question; specifically, respondents display the answer to
   be obvious or redundant, challenge the questioner's unknowing stance, or
   disalign with the further action implications of the question while
   still providing a polar answer. Comparisons are made with other
   practices for exerting agency in responses and with resources described
   for other languages. The resources available in French help participants
   differentiate in which way the respondent takes issue with the question,
   notwithstanding significant local particularization by reference to the
   specific question and its context. Data are in French, with English

   participants' (N = 155 young adult, ever-vapers) cognitive and affective

   how counterarguing, as the cognitive component of psychological
   reactance, influences available cognitive resources and encoding of
   message content. The results indicated that ever-vapers in the dogmatic
   PSA condition reported significantly greater freedom threats and state
   psychological reactance but not intentions to vape relative to
   ever-vapers in the suggestive PSA condition. Moreover, counterarguing
   dogmatic anti-vaping PSAs resulted in fewer available cognitive

Abstract = {Recent studies on conflict and terrorism news coverage have documented
   an ingroup bias as well as an increasingly negative discourse about
   Muslims in the wake of Islamist terrorist attacks. Yet, as most of these
   studies have focused on Western media and settings, the determinants of
   news media's religious biases and out-group categorizations remain
   insufficiently understood. In this article, we draw on interviews with
   Nigerian media practitioners and a comparison of Boko Haram news
   coverage in two Nigerian newspapers-one
   Southern-based/Christian-affiliated and one
   Northern-based/Muslim-affiliated-to argue that it is crucial to consider
   a country's political-religious demography in order to understand the
   way in which religious-based violence is covered in the news. In this
   respect, we identify micro-, meso- and macro-level theoretical
   mechanisms through which a country's demography can promote domestic
   news outlets-regardless of their background and readership-to cover
   conflict in a more balanced, nuanced, and objective way.},

Abstract = {Prescriptive grammar rules are taught in education, generally to ban the
   use of certain frequently encountered constructions in everyday
   language. This may lead to hypercorrection, meaning that the prescribed
   form in one construction is extended to another one in which it is in
   fact prohibited by prescriptive grammar. We discuss two such cases in
   Dutch: the hypercorrect use of the comparative particle dan `than' in
   equative constructions, and the hypercorrect use of the accusative
   pronoun hen `them' for a dative object. In two experiments, high school
   students of three educational levels were tested on their use of these
   hypercorrect forms (n(exp1) = 162, n(exp2) = 159). Our results indicate
   an overall large amount of hypercorrection across all levels of
   education, including preuniversity level students who otherwise perform
   better in constructions targeted by prescriptive grammar rules. We
   conclude that while teaching prescriptive grammar rules to high school
   students seems to increase their use of correct forms in certain
   constructions, this comes at a cost of hypercorrection in others.},

Abstract = {With the ascendency of English as a global lingua franca, a clearer
   understanding of what constitutes intelligible speech is needed.
   However, research systematically investigating the threshold of
   intelligibility has been very limited. In this article, we provide a
   brief summary of the literature as it pertains to intelligible and
   comprehensible speech, and then report on an exploratory study seeking
   to determine what specific features of accented speech make it difficult
   for global listeners to process. Eighteen speakers representing six
   English varieties were recruited to provide speech stimuli for two
   English listening tests. Sixty listeners from the same six English
   varieties took part in the listening tests, and their scores were then
   assessed against measurable segmental, prosodic, and fluency features
   found in the speech samples. Results indicate that it is possible to
   identify particular features of English speech varieties that are most
   likely to lead to a breakdown in communication, and that the number of
   such features present in a particular speakers' speech can predict
   intelligibility.},

   The Role of Case Characteristics},
Journal = {POLITICAL COMMUNICATION},

Volume = {38},
Number = {4},

Abstract = {Research on the media coverage of decisions by the U.S. Supreme Court
   has revealed that the newsworthiness of a court decision - as determined
   by specific case characteristics - influences the likelihood that the
   decision will be covered by the media. However, in the context of
   European constitutional courts, media coverage of court decisions can be
   understood to be a form of justice reporting that focuses on general
   public interest and is operationalized by case characteristics that
   indicate the newsworthiness of the decisions. Using the case of the
   German Federal Constitutional Court, the determining factors behind
   whether court decisions are featured in the German media (i.e., that
   they receive media coverage in at least one newspaper article) are
   expounded. A local text alignment measurement of court decisions and
   newspaper articles enables media coverage to be identified based on
   original data on 3,404 decisions and 9,436 newspaper articles from
   between 2008 and 2018. The results demonstrate that media coverage of
   the German Court is not affected by declarations of unconstitutionality,
   though coverage is more likely when a decision is accompanied by a press
   release, an oral hearing, a dissenting opinion, or a combination of all
   three items. As these decisional aspects are the prerogative of the FCC,
   the results demonstrate that the German Constitutional Court has the
   necessary instruments to independently influence media coverage.},

Abstract = {Although the vehicle horn is a minimal audible unit for communication,

   how they use it for warnings, for complaints, and in instructing the
   seeing of an aspect of an ambiguous traffic object. Drivers' use of the
   horn involves, first, their sounding it in recognizable relations to
   past, current, and projected configurations of traffic on the road.
   Second, it involves drivers manipulating the vehicle horn to create
   sounds of shorter and longer durations that can then produce hearably
   distinct actions. Third, and finally, the driver can use the horn as an
   initiating or responsive action in relation to the actions of other
   members of traffic. The data are from road users in Chennai, India.},

Abstract = {Subdisciplines in communication studies have developed competing and
   self-contained theories of meaning multiplicity. Arguing that this
   fragmented scholarship falls short of grasping the full scope of the
   phenomenon, this article offers Decoding Convergence-Divergence (DCD) as
   an interdisciplinary analytical and conceptual framework. Synthesizing
   principles from cognitive, cultural, and speaker-centered approaches to
   meaning multiplicity, this framework was applied in a study that
   examined news coverage of a CEO's initiative to address income
   inequality and its reception by different segments of the American
   audience. The study's results provide a novel demonstration of the joint
   contribution of opposing theories to the understanding of meaning
   multiplicity. Specifically, it found that textual polysemy, partisan
   selective perception, and the use of strategic ambiguity coalesced in
   the interpretive dynamics of this story. Based on these results, the
   article discusses the contribution of DCD to bridging competing
   approaches and the potential applications of the framework.},

Month = {MAY 27},
Abstract = {How to study media diversity has become a major concern in today's media
   landscape. Many expect that algorithmic filtering and a shift of
   audiences from legacy media to new intermediaries decrease the diversity
   of news diets, leading to fragmented societies, polarization and spread
   of misinformation. Different fields, from journalism research to law and
   computer science, are involved in the study of media diversity. They
   operate, however, with vastly different vocabularies, frameworks, and
   measurements. To overcome this fragmentation, this study provides an
   extensive overview of conceptualizations and operationalizations of
   media diversity in different fields using a systematic literature review
   (1999-2018). This showed a lack of theorizing and linking of conceptual
   with empirical work in media diversity research. Based on this, we
   develop a framework on how to move forward: Regarding conceptualization,
   we call for focusing on different places in the journalistic information
   chain instead of the classical exposure-supply distinction.
   Methodologically, automated approaches (e.g., analyzing digital traces)
   and qualitative approaches (e.g., capturing perceptions of diversity)
   should receive more attention. For analysis, matters of balance and
   disparity need to be stressed more, especially discussing possible
   limits to diversity. Overall, research into media diversity thus needs
   to be addressed in interdisciplinary collaboration.},

Abstract = {Modern states are distinguished by the breadth and depth of public
   regulation over private affairs. This aspect of state capacity and state
   power is predicated on frequent and dense encounters between the state
   and the population it seeks to control. We argue that literacy in the
   language of state administration facilitates state-society interaction
   by lowering the transaction costs of those encounters. We support this
   claim with evidence drawing upon detailed historical data from
   nineteenth-century France during a crucial period of state and nation
   building. Focusing on the specific domain of French marriage
   regulations, we find that increasing literacy predicts greater popular
   involvement with local authorities across French regions over time.
   These results demonstrate that literacy plays an important role in
   political development not solely by enhancing loyalty to the state, as
   the literature has recognized, but also by lowering linguistic and human
   capital barriers to state-society interaction.},

Abstract = {This article shows, with Malaysia as a case study, that an
   ethnonationalist language policy need not have disempowering
   consequences for minorities. Malaysia politicizes ethnic difference
   between Malaysians of Malay, Chinese, and Indian descent. Ethnic Malays
   enjoy economic concessions unavailable to others, law defines Malaysia
   as Islamic and speaking Bahasa, and Malay ethno-nationalism constructs
   Chinese- and Indian-Malaysians as perpetual visitors. Nonetheless,
   Bahasa has only added to the multilingual repertoires of non-Malays,
   rather than replaced it. This article analyses survey data about the
   multilingual practices of Malaysian youth and their folk linguistic talk
   about what guides their multilingualism. By drawing on critical language
   policy, it appears that policy may be so ethnonationalist that it has
   caused disassociation, especially amongst Indian-Malaysians, and
   sustained multilingualism. The Chinese-Malaysian experience, however, is
   better explained by a posthumanist perspective whereby language choices
   appear guided by material and immaterial resources within the
   Chinese-Malaysian community, rather than by matters of power or
   politics. In any case, the relative greater multilingualism of
   Chinese-and Indian-Malaysians was perceived as empowering non-Malay
   mobility despite ethnonationalist policy.},

Abstract = {The last decade has seen the meteoric rise of data campaigning as a

   how journalists and political professionals construct practices of data
   campaigning as all-powerful despite the limited empirical findings to

   coverage of campaigns' use of data and analytics has often relied on
   inflated accounts of the objectivity of analytics, the belief that more
   data necessarily means more and better knowledge, and narratives of
   objective outsiders - notably geeks, hackers, nerds, and scientists -
   that situate analytics staffers as strange and different, and as
   uniquely qualified to access the truth. To do this, I engage in critical
   discourse analysis of popular coverage of data campaigning in the US in
   the years 2008-2016. Ultimately, denaturalizing these narratives helps
   reveal how they contribute to defining this ``new{''} campaign strategy
   as fundamentally concerned with finding objective answers to solvable
   problems and are key to political professionals' maintenance of
   organizational power.},

Abstract = {Does seeing Spanish-language news in the media change the racial and
   political attitudes of Whites and Spanish-speaking Latinos? We examine
   the effects of Spanish-language media on White and Spanish-speaking
   Latino attitudes using online survey experiments in English and Spanish,
   respectively. We expect White Americans to react to Spanish-language
   media options by developing more hostile attitudes toward Hispanics, and
   Spanish-speaking Latino audiences to feel a greater sense of belonging
   in America when they see Spanish represented in the media. We find that
   seeing articles about non-immigration politics in Spanish, as an option
   next to English articles, significantly raises racial resentment toward
   Hispanics among Whites. Among Spanish-speaking Latinos, seeing a
   political news article option in Spanish increases feelings of inclusion
   and belonging, even when it is not about a racialized issue like
   immigration. Such evidence suggests that language alone may prime
   identity and shape political attitudes for White and Spanish-speaking
   Latino voters.},

Pages = {30-51},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {This article explores the way native language teachers translate their
   linguistic and cultural experience in order to make it understandable to
   their students in the classroom. It examines how they report on this
   translation to researchers in two research projects conducted with two
   Chinese teachers (Kramsch and Zhang 2018) and one Japanese
   teacher/researcher (Shibahara and Kramsch forthcoming). Drawing on House
   (2017) and Pym (2010), it shows how the translation of experience takes
   place on three levels: the overt level of linguistic equivalence; the
   covert level of functional equivalence through a cultural filter; and
   the level of a cultural translation that has to be negotiated according
   to the subjective needs of the participants. These studies reveal that
   native language teachers tend to prefer overt over covert translations
   and that they engage in cultural translation not in order to explore but
   in order to overcome cultural difference. Such findings confront the
   field of applied linguistics with its age-old challenge as a field
   called to translate real-world problems of the practice into the
   language of research and vice-versa.},

   Evidence from Afghanistan},
Journal = {AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {114},
Number = {1},
Pages = {126-143},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Governments, militaries, and aid organizations all rely on economic
   interventions to shape civilian attitudes toward combatants during
   wartime. We have, however, little individual-level evidence that these
   ``hearts and minds{''} programs actually influence combatant support. We
   address this problem by conducting a factorial randomized control trial
   of two common interventions-vocational training and cash transfers-on
   combatant support among 2,597 at-risk youth in Kandahar, Afghanistan. We
   find that training only improved economic livelihoods modestly and had
   little effect on combatant support. Cash failed to lift incomes,
   producing a boom-and-bust dynamic in which pro-government sentiment
   initially spiked and then quickly reversed itself, leaving a residue of
   increased Taliban support. Conditional on training, cash failed to
   improve beneficiaries' livelihoods but did increase support for the
   Afghan government for at least eight months after the intervention.
   These findings suggest that aid affects attitudes by providing
   information about government resolve and competence rather than by
   improving economic livelihoods.},

Title = {Self-Rule and the Problem of Peoplehood in Colonial India},
Journal = {AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {114},
Number = {1},
Pages = {81-94},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {This article theorizes the colonial problem of peoplehood that Indian
   anticolonial thinkers grappled with in their attempts to conceptualize
   self-rule, or swaraj. British colonial rule drew its legitimacy from a
   developmentalist conception of the colonized people as backward and
   disunited. The discourse of ``underdeveloped{''} colonial peoplehood
   rendered the Indian people ``unfit{''} for self-government, suspending
   their sovereignty to an indefinite future. The concept of swaraj would
   be born with the rejection of deferred colonial self-government. Yet the
   persistence of the developmentalist figuration of the people generated a
   crisis of sovereign authorization. The pre-Gandhian swaraj theorists
   would be faced with the not-yet claimable figure of the people at the
   very moment of disavowing the British claim to rule. Recovering this
   underappreciated pre-Gandhian history of the concept of swaraj and
   reinterpreting its Gandhian moment, this article offers a new reading of
   Gandhi's theory of moral self-rule. In so doing, it demonstrates how the
   history of swaraj helps trace the colonial career of popular
   sovereignty.},

Abstract = {This article contributes to the study of nonlexical sound resources in

   have a physiological origin but also assume an interactional relevance:
   sniffing sounds made by participants when smelling. On the basis of a
   video-recorded tasting session in which participants engage in
   describing aromas, the article details the systematic organization of
   sniffing in a diversity of sequential environments-in which
   sniff-prefaced turns offer aroma descriptions in response to olfactory
   inquiries, confirm previous descriptions, and give alternative
   descriptions. Analyzing audible sounds made while visibly smelling in
   face-to-face interaction, the article's aims are twofold: to contribute
   to the multimodal study of sounds in interaction and also to the study
   of sensoriality as an intersubjective practice through the systematic
   investigation of smelling-in-interaction. Data are in French with

Abstract = {This article explores the use of clicks-a nonverbal vocalization-in
   everyday talk. It is argued that clicks are one way of not saying
   something, i.e., of not producing talk when talk was due. While many
   clicks occur alongside verbal material, which provides a method for
   participants to ascribe an action to the turn in which they are
   embedded, many do not. The article explores the linguistic (especially
   phonetic), sequential and embodied resources available to participants
   to make sense of such clicks. It is argued that some clicks have
   properties of linguistic organization: They have nonarbitrary
   form-meaning mappings. Other clicks by contrast are interpreted more as
   ad hoc, singular events. The article contributes to a less logocentric
   view of talk-in-interaction. Data are in British and American English

Abstract = {Climate change is one of the greatest ecological and social challenges
   of the twenty-first century. Sociologists have made important
   contributions to our knowledge of the human drivers of contemporary
   climate change, including better understanding of the effects of social
   structure and political economy on national greenhouse gas emissions,
   the interplay of power and politics in the corporate sector and in
   policy systems, and the factors that influence individual actions by
   citizens and consumers. Sociology is also poised to make important
   contributions to the study of climate justice across multiple lines of
   stratification, including race, class, gender, indigenous identity,
   sexuality and queerness, and disability, and to articulate the effects
   of climate change on our relationship to nonhuman species. To realize
   its potential to contribute to the societal discourse on climate change,
   sociology must become theoretically integrated, engage with other
   disciplines, and remain concerned with issues related to environmental
   and climate inequalities.},

Abstract = {With half the world now online, a handful of websites dominate globally.
   Yet little is known about the homogeneity or geographical distinctness
   of global web use patterns. Focusing beyond popular sites, we inquired
   into how and why countries are similar in their web use patterns,
   developing a framework drawing on the literatures on media
   globalization, as well as Internet geographies. To compute similarities
   in web use between countries, we utilized an algorithm that considered
   both ranking positions and overlap counts on ranked lists of the 100
   most popular websites for 174 countries, totaling 6,252 unique websites.
   Findings from a network analysis and from regressions suggest that
   countries with similar languages and shared borders, as well as those
   vastly different in their Internet market sizes, tend to have similar
   web use patterns. Neither are countries particularly similar to the US
   in web use nor does the prevalence of English speakers have an
   influence.},

Abstract = {Applied linguists have developed complex theories of the ability to
   communicate in a second language (L2). However, the perspectives on L2
   communication ability of speakers who are not trained language
   professionals have been incorporated neither into theories of
   communication ability nor in the criteria for assessing performance on
   general-purpose oral proficiency tests. This potentially weakens the
   validity of such tests because the ultimate arbiters of L2 speakers'
   oral performance are not trained language professionals. This study
   investigates the perspectives of these linguistic laypersons on L2
   communication ability. Twenty-three native and non-native
   English-speaking linguistic laypersons judged L2 speakers' oral
   performances and verbalized the reasons for their judgments. The results
   showed that the participants focus not only on the linguistic aspects of
   the speaker's output but also on features that applied linguists have
   less paid attention to. Even where speaker's linguistic errors were
   acknowledged, message conveyance and comprehensibility of the message
   contributed to their judgment. The study has implications for language
   testing and the development of tests reflecting the construct of English
   as a lingua franca.},

Abstract = {The 2016US election and the victory of Donald Trump are closely
   connected to a perceived rise of the far-right in the United States. We
   build upon public sphere and alternative media theory to discuss the
   relevance of alternative media for the US (far-)right and whether the
   election period and the candidate Trump allowed far-right alternative
   media to establish themselves in the (far-) right networked public
   sphere. We investigate whether it has come to a convergence of topics
   between the right and the extreme far-right. We analyze the topics nine
   right-wing outlets, ranging from Fox News to the Neo-Nazi Daily Stormer,
   covered in 2015/2016 during the US presidential election. We show
   through topic modeling of 21,919 articles how Breitbart established
   itself as a media outlet between the extreme far-right and mainstream
   right by both covering more extreme and more classic conservative
   topics. We show through time series clustering how Breitbart and Fox
   News converged in their coverage of Islam and immigration. Finally, we
   show through hyperlink analysis that the connection between the
   far-right and the mainstream right is mostly one-sided; while the
   alternative outlets link to more established ones, the established
   outlets mostly ignore the outlets from the far-right.},

Abstract = {This inductive study extends scholarship on gender, feedback and
   leadership by drawing on a large naturalistic data set of 1057 narrative
   developmental feedback comments to 146 political leaders in the UK. We
   used automated topic modeling, a novel methodology, to identify 12
   underlying topics within developmental feedback, and complemented this
   with an in-depth qualitative analyses of feedback content for male and
   female political leaders across the topics. This resulted in four
   aggregate theoretical dimensions: 1) strategic focus 2) political
   influence 3) confidence and 4) agency and communion. Our findings chart
   novel dimensions of gender bias that go beyond the widely theorized
   tension posed by agency {[}male] and communion {[}female]. These new
   dimensions are pertinent to developmental, rather than performance
   feedback processes, and provide male and female leaders with different
   developmental roadmaps. We outline the value of our novel methodology to
   leadership scholarship and discuss implications for future research and
   practice.},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {There has been to date a long tradition of research in workplace
   discourse. The bulk of the research has focused on professional
   white-collar workplaces, but a handful of studies have examined
   working-class settings such as factories and building sites. This area
   of research has, however, been concerned with interactions involving
   co-workers. Studies examining interactions between newcomers and
   experienced others, such as Holmes and Woodhams (2013), are rare. Using
   data collected in the working-class setting of the professional kitchen,
   the current study presents interactions between newcomer trainee cooks
   and the cooks they worked under. It focuses on the use of directives,
   which was a prevalent feature of their interactions. As individual
   utterances, the directives would seem to be designed to elicit specific,
   ad-hoc actions from trainees. However, closer analysis reveals that
   series of directives may serve important instructional purposes.
   Findings from the study are useful in raising the awareness of those
   assigned to mentor trainees in work settings and should enhance
   on-the-job workplace training as well as support newcomers as they
   adjust to their new workplaces.},

Title = {How to Disengage: Suspension, Body Torque, and Repair},
Journal = {RESEARCH ON LANGUAGE AND SOCIAL INTERACTION},
Abstract = {This article uses conversation analysis to study other-initiated repair
   in multiactivity situations. The article focuses on two aspects of the
   repair initiator?s embodied conduct directly connected to the
   initiator?s involvement in multiactivity: body torque and the suspension
   of a parallel manual activity. The analysis reveals how the body torque
   and suspension of manual activity, when co-occurring with
   other-initiations of repair, display the OIR-speaker?s temporary
   disengagement from the manual activity and how this embodied conduct
   communicates downward prioritization of the manual activity and
   increased involvement in the interaction. This article shows that, to
   participants in a conversation and simultaneously involved in
   multiactivity, solving interactional trouble is prioritized over the
   progression of the parallel manual task and that this hierarchization of
   activities displays a strong preference toward restoration and
   maintenance of intersubjectivity. Data are in English and in French with

Abstract = {Negative elite and news media attention to Latino-relevant issues,
   particularly undocumented immigration, has dramatically increased in
   recent years, potentially stigmatizing attributes of Latinos such as
   immigration status and language use. Concomitantly, immigration policy
   changes were leading to widespread arrests and deportation of many
   Latinos. Herein, we ask two questions: First, to what extent do Latinos
   perceive and experience discrimination? Second, to what extent do
   immigration status, generational status, and language use moderate
   beliefs about discrimination? Using Pew National Survey of Latinos data,
   we find that Latino beliefs about the problem of discrimination is a
   decreasing function of ``proximity{''} to the ``canonical
   immigrant{''}-defined here as first-generation immigrants who are
   Spanish-language dominant. Further, we demonstrate that reported rates
   of victimization due to discrimination exhibit no clear pattern and are
   flat over time. We conclude by demonstrating that discrimination beliefs
   have significant implications for systemic trust, anxiety, and policy
   preferences.},

Abstract = {This article interrogates the relationship between epistemic authority
   and journalistic technology through the perspective of mechanical
   objectivity-a belief in technological systems capable of rendering a
   particular output in a manner that overcomes the limits of human
   subjectivity. By treating journalistic objectivity not as a stable
   referent, but as a contextual one prone to shifts in practices and
   understandings over time, it foregrounds how changing technologies of
   recording, creating, and distributing news content affect how
   journalistic objectivity is understood. Following this perspective, two
   technological practices are examined: photojournalism and algorithms.
   The development of photojournalism led to the prizing of news images as
   objective representations produced by the camera to the diminishment of
   human judgment. Similarly, the various outputs produced by news
   algorithms are accompanied by an orientation toward computational
   objectivity in contrast to human subjectivity. Exploring these dynamics
   sheds light on the ongoing relationship between news technologies and
   discourses of journalistic objectivity in the face of digital
   innovations in the production and circulation of news.},

Abstract = {This article proposes a definition of alternative news media and
   suggests routes for further research. It complements and extends
   previous conceptualizations in research on alternative media and
   outlines an umbrella definition of this phenomenon aimed to inspire
   contemporary research and scholarly debate. Previous research has been
   guided by a ``progressive{''} perspective as a form of resistance
   against ``bourgeois{''} hegemonic discourse. Such normative evaluations
   have in turn limited how the phenomenon has been studied empirically, by
   limiting the scope of research so that important contemporary phenomena
   fall outside the theoretical map. Conceptualizing alternative news media
   in the present hybrid and polarized media environment, we first propose
   a non-normative, multilevel relational definition: Alternative news
   media position themselves as correctives of the mainstream news media,
   as expressed in editorial agendas or statements and/or are perceived as
   such by their audiences or third-parties. This counter-hegemonic
   alternativeness can emerge on the macro-level of societal function, the
   meso-level of organizations and/or the micro-level of news content and
   producers. Second, demonstrating why this umbrella definition is
   fruitful in the changing media environment characterized by boundary
   struggles, crisis in legacy news media and mushrooming of alternative
   news outlets, we highlight research gaps and propose future research.},

Abstract = {What is the relationship between interpretive methods and decolonizing
   projects? Decolonial thinkers often invoke pre-colonial traditions in
   their efforts to fashion ``national cultures{''}- modes of being,
   understanding, and self-expression specific to a de-colonizing
   collectivity's experience. While the substantive contributions of
   precolonial traditions to decolonial thought have received well-deserved
   attention in postcolonial and comparative political theory, this paper
   focuses on the role that interpretive methods play in generating the
   emancipatory sensibilities envisioned by decolonial thinkers. It draws
   on the contemporary Moroccan philosopher Mohammed `Abed Al-Jabri's
   interpretive method to show that its decolonial potential lies in its
   ``reader-centric{''} approach. This approach is concerned with
   transforming its postcolonial reader's relationship to precolonial
   traditions, and not only with establishing the truth of historical texts
   or making use of their insights in the present as is more common in
   political-theoretical modes of interpretation. It does so through a
   tripartite process of disconnection, reconnection, and praxis.},

   of phraseology, especially Construction Grammar. The article proposes
   that a large number of meaning-pattern combinations can be identified as
   constructions. This endeavour assists and is assisted by the derivation
   of a local grammar of evaluation. The grammar is made explicit in 22
   `Analyses', grouped into five main categories. It includes discussion
   around the process of mapping meaning on to pattern, the consideration
   of borderline cases, and the debate around naming of elements. This
   contributes to a comparison of different approaches to phraseology, and
   in particular to the place of Construction Grammar in relation to more
   output-oriented approaches. Suggestions for the application of this
   approach to language teaching are offered.},

Abstract = {Using multimodal conversation analysis, this article analyses language
   learning as an in situ process during a teacher-assigned, experientially
   based pedagogical activity. The activity involved a three-part
   pedagogical structure, where learners first prepared for and then
   participated in real-life service encounters, and later reflected on
   their experiences back in the classroom. The analysis details how the
   co-constructed telling sequences through which novice second language
   users re-enact their experiences create an occasion for language-focused
   activity. We argue that the actions through which the participants
   display and sustain an orientation to an interactional practice as an
   object of learning make visible a learning project. The findings
   illuminate the practices through which language-focused activity is
   initiated, sustained, and managed to enable in situ learning. They also
   show how re-enactments function in storytelling and display a novice
   learner's interactional competence. Finally, the findings illustrate how
   experiences gained in everyday social activities can be `harvested and
   reflected upon' (Wagner 2015: 77) in the classroom and contribute to
   recent initiatives to develop teaching practices that support learning

Abstract = {Is criminal disenfranchisement compatible with a democratic political
   order? This article considers this question in light of a recently
   developed view that criminal disenfranchisement is justified because it
   expresses our commitment to democratic values. We call this view
   expressive disenfranchisement and refer to the general conception in
   which it is grounded as democratic expressivism. Contra supporters of
   expressive disenfranchisement, we argue that democratic expressivism
   does not offer a sound justification of criminal disenfranchisement.
   Additionally, we argue that, insofar as one really cares about answering
   serious criminal wrongs via an expression of democratic values, criminal
   disenfranchisement should be abandoned and replaced with a policy that
   temporarily obliges the relevant criminals to vote. Democratic
   expressivists should, in other words, move from supporting the
   disenfranchisement of serious offenders to endorsing a policy of
   compulsory criminal voting for a finite period of time.},

Journal = {POLITICAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {36},

Abstract = {Communication of political information is vital for a well-functioning
   democratic system, and texts are one of the main mediums of politics.
   Most studies dealing with political text consider how such texts
   communicate content, rather than the structural characteristics of texts
   themselves. The current study focuses on complexity as one of the focal
   structural characteristics of political text. Previous research showed
   that different types of textual complexity affect learning processes.
   Such prior studies are, however, limited both conceptually and
   empirically. This study addresses these gaps by employing a large-scale
   experimental design (N= 822), investigating how different dimensions of
   textual complexity affect factual and structural political knowledge,
   and whether such relationships are mediated through perceived
   complexity. Results indicate that different levels (high vs. low) and
   different dimensions of textual complexity (semantic vs. syntactic)
   influence reader's perception of text, as well as their factual and
   structural knowledge. Only semantic complexity has an effect on one's
   perceived complexity, which in turn negatively affects factual and
   structural knowledge. Syntactic complexity directly lowered one's
   factual knowledge acquisition, while there was no direct effect of
   syntactic complexity on structural knowledge. The results suggest that
   text complexity indeed plays an important role in political information
   acquisition, and our findings also highlight the importance of
   perception in mediating the structural effects of the text.},

Abstract = {This article reviews research that uses conversation analysis to analyze
   online interaction. Research in this area has tended to focus on several
   key areas, and these are addressed in detail: turn taking, sequence
   organization, repair, openings, and embodied conduct. The focus is on
   how these features of interaction are organized online and across online
   platforms and how the interactional practices may orient to particular
   affordances of the platforms. The debates around the use of CA
   terminology when analyzing online interaction are also discussed.
   Overall, this review suggests that CA can offer in-depth evidence about
   the nature of online interaction and so can contribute to wider debates
   about the role of technology in society. At the same time, through
   analyzing online interaction there is the possibility for understanding
   how interactional practices arise and develop over time. Data are in

   impairment: (a) atypical forms of delay in TCU progressivity; (b)
   atypical problems of understandability, intelligibility, and hearing;
   and (c) atypical actions. I also discuss forms of atypicality that
   appear to arise from one or more participants adapting their talk or
   conduct to deal with the impact of the impairment within interaction.
   The article concludes with some considerations of directions that future
   work in this field might take. Data are in British and Australian

   increases in the complexity (operationalized as number of elements) of
   three versions of each of three tasks on the syntactic complexity and
   lexical diversity of the speech of 42 English native speakers. Data on
   native speaker performance are important because they reveal task
   complexity effects unfiltered by non-native competence. Independent
   evidence that greater task complexity increased cognitive load was shown
   by participant self-ratings of perceived difficulty, mental effort, and
   stress, shorter prospective duration estimates and, using dual-task
   methodology, slower reaction times. Mid-complex versions of the three
   tasks elicited the most complex syntactic structures, and the most
   complex versions elicited the greatest lexical diversity. Implications
   are noted for the design of parallel studies with non-native speakers,

Abstract = {Using data of articles from 42 Social Science Citation Index
   (SSCI)-indexed journals of applied linguistics, this study renders a

   analysis focuses on, among other issues, the most frequently discussed
   topics, the most highly cited publications, and the changes that have
   occurred in the research trends. The results show that while most of the
   frequently discussed topics have remained popular over the 12 years,
   some (especially sociocultural/functional/identity issues) have
   experienced a significant increase of interest, but some others
   (particularly certain phonological/grammatical/generative linguistic
   topics) have witnessed a substantial decrease of interest. There has
   also been an increased use of new theories including those coming from
   distant disciplines. Furthermore, while the number of publications from
   traditional publication powerhouses, such as the USA, has shown a slow,
   albeit steady decline proportionally, those from some other countries,
   such as China, have exhibited a substantial steady rise. The latter
   countries' increasing publication rates appear to have contributed to
   the increased discussion of issues specific to their context.
   Implications of the findings are also discussed.},

Abstract = {Do judges telegraph their preferences during oral arguments? Using the
   U.S. Supreme Court as our example, we demonstrate that Justices
   implicitly reveal their leanings during oral arguments, even before
   arguments and deliberations have concluded. Specifically, we extract the
   emotional content of over 3,000 hours of audio recordings spanning 30
   years of oral arguments before the Court. We then use the level of
   emotional arousal, as measured by vocal pitch, in each of the Justices'
   voices during these arguments to accurately predict many of their
   eventual votes on these cases. Our approach yields predictions that are
   statistically and practically significant and robust to including a
   range of controls; in turn, this suggests that subconscious vocal
   inflections carry information that legal, political, and textual
   information do not.},

   the same tests to 48 students in non-classroom settings in these same
   two cities. We found significant differences in both sets of results,
   with classroom participants registering stronger preferences for Belize
   City Kriol in status and solidarity traits. Our results add to a small
   but important body of literature in which setting is shown to influence

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Recent longitudinal approaches to second language (L2) pronunciation
   development have prioritized developmental trajectories, highlighting
   individual variation in phonetic learning over time. Aligning with this
   research paradigm, the present study examined voice onset time (VOT)
   production in Spanish/b/and/p/ over two semesters of elementary language
   instruction. Twenty-six native speakers of English who were novice
   learners of Spanish completed two L2 production tasks five times and an
   English production task once, designed to ascertain the frequency with
   which they prevoiced English voiced stops. Growth curve modeling
   revealed that linear and quadratic functions most accurately captured
   participants' L2 VOT development insofar as more gains occurred during
   the first half of the study. Speakers' propensity to prevoice in the
   native language also predicted prevoicing in L2 Spanish/b/. However,
   individual results varied, including near-native learners and
   asymmetrical developers, individuals who improved their production of
   /p/but not/b/. These results are interpreted within the frameworks of
   the Speech Learning Model and L2 Perceptual Assimilation Model.},

Volume = {40},

Abstract = {Extensive reading (ER) has been implemented in various second language
   (L2) teaching and learning contexts, and studies in the field have
   provided a wealth of empirical evidence that a large amount of L2
   reading over an extended time improves students' reading ability and
   benefits other areas of language learning (Nakanishi 2015; Jeon and Day
   2016). However, despite the large amount of research on ER, there is
   still a lack of studies that show how or whether students accomplish
   learning during ER activities. To begin to fill this gap, this study
   applies a conversation analytic lens to investigate cases of local L2
   learning and linguistic development during ER book club interactions.
   The analysis of the selected excerpts shows how the participants
   themselves shift the interactional focus from book talk to a lexical
   item during talk-in-interaction (i.e. orientation to learning), and how
   they deploy the learning object in subsequent speech events (i.e.
   short-term development). The analysis also shows how the participants
   orient to emergent learning objects from several different angles (e.g.
   pronunciation, meaning, spelling, and morphological form).},

Pages = {43-63},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {We examine the syntactic structures exhibited by persons with dementia
   in conversation. Traditionally, research on the linguistic abilities of
   persons with dementia is either observational (reports kept by
   caregivers) or experimental (e.g. based on comprehension tasks), and the
   focus is not on the syntactic competence of the speaker. We combine
   insights from corpus-based syntactic analysis with methods from
   interactional approaches. Our close syntactic analysis of the talk of 20
   persons diagnosed with dementia and their non-impaired co-participants
   document both grammatical accuracy and the range of linguistic
   complexity produced as compared to patterns reported in studies of
   non-impaired speakers. We note the selection of complex grammatical
   structures (i.e. verbal arguments) is largely a consequence of the
   interaction rather than evidence of linguistic decrement. We report on
   the most pertinent of these interactional influences. Our findings
   support strategies that promote complex linguistic and interactional
   talk with persons diagnosed with dementia. We believe that these
   strategies will help increase the interactional opportunities that are
   lacking as reported by and about persons residing in an assisted living
   facility (Brooker 2011).},

Abstract = {There are reasons why some political ideas fit better into a theoretical
   framework than others. This article analyzes attempts to detheorize
   nationalism, arguing that they serve three major functions. First, they
   free nationalists from universalizing their arguments and from the
   ensuing rights and obligations. Second, they allow its rivals to present
   nationalism as morally inferior to other political standpoints. Third,
   they lead to the singling out and legitimization of one specific form of
   nationalism that is principle driven. Drawing a line between forms of
   nationalism-those motivated by primordial feelings and those motivated
   by rational and universal principles-lays the groundwork for a
   distinction between ethnic and civic nationalism. Though in theory these
   are two distinct forms of nationalism, in reality the boundaries are
   blurred. And yet advocates of civic nationalism keep the distinction
   alive, wishing to distance themselves from the other form of nationalism
   and promoting a vision (some would say the illusion) of a nationless
   nationalism. Assuming thatWestern democracies have transcended their
   national and ethnic elements encourages politicians to ignore social
   schisms, avoiding the need to cope with their consequences. The civic
   language therefore not only is theoretically inaccurate but also
   motivates avoidance where action is needed.},

Abstract = {In spite of the widespread use of Common European Framework of Reference
   for language learning, teaching, and assessment (CEFR) scales, there is
   an overwhelming lack of evidence regarding their power to describe
   empirical learner language (Fulcher 2004; Hulstijn 2007). This article
   presents results of a study that focused on the empirical robustness
   (i.e. the power of level descriptions to capture what learners actually
   do in a language test) of the CEFR vocabulary \& fluency scales (A2-B2).
   Data stem from an Italian \& German oral proficiency test (Abel et al.
   2012). Results show that the empirical robustness was flawed: Some scale
   contents were hardly observable or so evenly distributed that they could
   not distinguish between learners. Contradictory/weak correlations among
   scale features and heterogeneous cluster solutions suggest that scales
   did not consistently capture typical learner behaviour. Often, learner
   language could not be objectively described by any level description.
   Also, it was only partially possible to link scale contents to
   research-based measures of fluency and vocabulary. Given the importance
   of CEFR levels in many high-stakes contexts, the results suggest the
   need of a large empirical validation project.},

   proposes Membership Categorization Analysis (MCA) as one possible
   approach for examining the participants' endogenous makings of social
   class in situ. With interview excerpts of mothers discussing an English
   immersion policy proposal in South Korea, I will demonstrate how MCA can
   produce an analysis that is empirically grounded in the participants'
   own categorial knowledge and commonsense reasoning about stratified
   social structure. Such an approach respecifies social class from being a
   rigid, abstract, and predetermined construct to a socially constructed

Abstract = {Posthumanism urges us to reconsider what it means to be human. From
   proclamations about the death of `Man' to investigations into enhanced
   forms of being, from the advent of the Anthropocene (human-induced
   planetary change) to new forms of materialism and distributed cognition,
   posthumanism raises significant questions for applied linguistics in
   terms of our understandings of language, humans, objects, and agency.
   After reviewing the broad field of post-humanist thought, this paper
   investigates-through an overview of a series of recent research
   projects-the notion of repertoire, to show how this can be better
   understood by stepping out of the humanist constructs of the individual
   and the community and looking instead at the notion of distributed
   language and spatial repertoires. The paper concludes by discussing the
   implications of posthumanism for applied linguistics, in particular the
   ways we understand language in relation to people, objects, and place.},

Volume = {62},
Number = {3},

Abstract = {Nearly all research on the political impact of Americans' religious and
   secular orientations assumes that such orientations are exogenous to
   politics. Using multiwave panel and experimental data, we find that
   religious and secular orientations are endogenous to political
   orientations. In other words, religion and secularism are a consequence
   as well as a cause of politics. In showing this, we make three major
   contributions. First, we conceptualize and measure secular orientations
   in a new way-not just as the absence of religion, but also as an
   affirmative secular identity and positive commitment to secular
   principles. Second, our panel and experimental data allow for the most
   definitive test to date of whether political orientations exert a causal
   effect on religious and secular orientations. Third, we isolate the
   conditions under which politics affects religious-secular perspectives,
   thus identifying the mechanism that underlies political orientations.},

Title = {Analyzing Computational Models},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {62},
Number = {3},
Pages = {745-759},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Computational models have been underutilized as tools for formal theory
   development, closing off theoretical analysis of complex substantive
   scenarios that they would well serve. I argue that this occurs for two
   reasons, and provide resolutions for each. First, computational models
   generally do not employ the language or modes of analysis common to
   game-theoretic models, the status quo in the literature. I detail the
   types of insights typically derived from game-theoretic models and
   discuss analogues in computational modeling. Second, there are not
   widely established procedures for analysis of deductive computational
   models. I present a regularized method for deriving comparative statics
   from computational models that provides insights comparable to those
   arising from game-theoretic analyses. It also serves as a framework for
   building theoretically tractable computational models. Together, these
   contributions should enhance communication between models of social
   science and open up the tool kit of deductive computational modeling for
   theory building to a broader audience.},

Abstract = {As a result of one young woman's ability to speak out, nine men living
   in Greater Manchester were convicted in 2012 for sex trafficking of
   underage girls. Reports revealed that numerous vulnerable teenagers had
   been coerced into keeping quiet about this in exchange for various
   rewards, but, through one victim's account, we can visualize the torture
   endured at the hands of these men. In an interview on ITV, Girl A
   constructs her identity as a survivor who describes how she has been
   preyed upon. To show how she perceives her world, herself, and other
   participants, this article applies a Critical Discourse Analysis
   informed approach. The focus is on the TRANSITIVITY patterns (Halliday
   and Matthiessen 2014) employed in her discourse and that of the
   interviewers, with the aim of providing insights into how this system
   shapes the representation of a particular experience, in this case rape.},

Journal = {LEADERSHIP QUARTERLY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {29},
Number = {3},
Pages = {389-402},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Although it is known that leaders can have a strong impact on whether
   employees voice work-related ideas or concerns, no research has
   investigated the impact of leader language on voice-particularly in
   professionally diverse contexts. Based on a social identity approach as
   well as on collectivistic leadership theories, we distinguish between
   implicit (i.e., First-Person Plural pronouns) and explicit (i.e.,
   invitations and appreciations) inclusive leader language and test its
   effects on voice in multi-professional teams. We hypothesized that
   implicit inclusive leader language promotes voice especially among team
   members sharing the same professional group membership as the leader
   (in-group team members) while explicit inclusive leader language
   promotes voice especially among team members belonging to a different
   professional group (out-group team members). These hypotheses were
   tested in a field setting in which 126 health care professionals (i.e.,
   nurses, resident and attending physicians), organized in 26 teams,
   managed medical emergencies. Behavioral coding and leader language
   analyses supported our hypotheses: Leaders' ``WE{''}-references were
   more strongly related to residents' (in-group) and explicit invitations
   related more strongly to nurses' (out-group) voice behavior. We discuss
   how inclusive leader language promotes employee voice and explain why
   group membership functions as an important moderator in professionally
   diverse teams.},

Volume = {112},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {In their 2016 American Political Science Review article, Kogelmann and
   Stich argue that public reason fails to provide the assurance reasonable
   citizens require to act justly and that, as a consequence, Rawls's
   account of political stability fails. Convergence discussions, because
   they are a costly signal, provide such assurance. Kogelmann and Stich
   fail to recognize that constituents influence representatives such that
   the costs of convergence discourse are unknown. It thus cannot assure.
   Constituents' influence also undermines convergence's ability to show
   how decision-making processes that follow its norms result in justified
   laws. Far from supporting convergence, then, the stability question
   demands revision of the view. This response develops these objections,
   extends them from Kogelmann and Stich's analysis to other convergence
   theorists and political liberals, and explores what political theorists
   can learn from convergence's difficulties.},

   is discounted. The results of the current study provide the first
   empirical evidence to account for the misgivings about emotional effects
   of personalized political information on media audiences. Using data
   from an online experiment, this study shows that news coverage regarding
   behaviors and personal characteristics of a foreign leader influences
   (a) evaluations of personal characteristics typical of his or her
   nation's citizens and (b) emotional perceptions of that leader's country
   (sentiment and respect). This effect is shown to reflect a psychological
   phenomenon whereby people project their emotions and perceptions
   regarding a leader's personal characteristics onto his or her country

Abstract = {How do civilians respond to civil war narratives? Do they react to

   battle for hearts and minds as well as strategic terrain, and winning
   the narrative war can shift legitimacy, popular support, and material
   resources to the sympathetically framed side. We examine the effect of
   one-sided and competing war discourses on ordinary people's
   understandings of the Syrian civil war-a conflict with multiple
   narratives, but which has become more communal over time. We conduct a
   framing experiment with a representative sample of Syrian refugees in
   Lebanon in which we vary the narrative that describes the reasons for
   the conflict. We find that sectarian explanations, framed in isolation,
   strongly increase the importance government supporters place on
   fighting. When counterframed against competing narratives, however, the
   rallying effect of sectarianism drops and vanishes.},

Abstract = {We introduce a model that extends the standard vote choice model to
   encompass text. In our model, votes and speech are generated from a
   common set of underlying preference parameters. We estimate the
   parameters with a sparse Gaussian copula factor model that estimates the
   number of latent dimensions, is robust to outliers, and accounts for
   zero inflation in the data. To illustrate its workings, we apply our
   estimator to roll call votes and floor speech from recent sessions of
   the US Senate. We uncover two stable dimensions: one ideological and the
   other reflecting to Senators' leadership roles. We then show how the
   method can leverage common speech in order to impute missing data,
   recovering reliable preference estimates for rank-and-file Senators
   given only leadership votes.},

Title = {Translingual Practice as Spatial Repertoires: Expanding the Paradigm
   beyond Structuralist Orientations},

Year = {2018},
Volume = {39},

Pages = {31-54},

Abstract = {The expanding orientations to translingualism are motivated by a gradual
   shift from the structuralist paradigm that has been treated as
   foundational in modern linguistics. Structuralism encouraged scholars to
   consider language, like other social constructs, as organized as a
   self-defining and closed structure, set apart from spatiotemporal
   `context' (which included diverse considerations such as history,
   geography, politics, and society). Translingualism calls for a shift
   from these structuralist assumptions to consider more mobile, expansive,
   situated, and holistic practices. In this article, I articulate how a
   poststructuralist paradigm might help us theorize and practice
   translingualism according to a spatial orientation that embeds
   communication in space and time, considering all resources as working
   together as an assemblage in shaping meaning. I illustrate from my
   ongoing research with international STEM scholars in a Midwestern
   American university to theorize how translingualism will redefine the
   role of constructs such as language, non-verbal artifacts, and context
   in communicative proficiency.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {68},
Number = {1},

Abstract = {Although it has been argued that populist communication only appeals to
   a specific audience, extant research has exclusively studied the effects
   of populist communication in forced-exposure media environments.
   Responding to this discrepancy, we conducted two experiments (N = 562
   and N = 558) in which we manipulated the core idea of populist
   messages-attributing blame-in forced and selective exposure media
   environments. Our results demonstrate that citizens higher in relative
   deprivation are most likely to select populist messages. Irrespective of
   selective exposure, citizens' populist attitudes are only positively
   affected if the populist message is congruent with their prior feelings
   of relative deprivation. These results provide important insights for
   the polarizing potential of media populism in a fragmented media
   environment.},

   Post-structuralism (philosophy) meets the digital age (electronics),

   future exploration. I want to first add my voice to the excitement
   generated by this trans-perspective, and then examine more closely the
   ways in which its dominant spatial metaphor gets declined across each of
   the papers, and finally raise a word of caution against the current
   engagement with space and the concomitant neglect of time and history. I
   end with a plea to bring back historicity and subjectivity into our
   applied linguistic enterprise.},

Journal = {APPLIED LINGUISTICS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {39},

Pages = {78-98},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Translingualism advocates for the appreciation of multilingual speakers'
   fluid, flexible, and creative deployment of semiotic resources without
   regard to the ideological constructs of named languages. While this
   scholarship has been developed primarily in the contexts of world
   Englishes, English as a lingua franca, and bilingual education in
   Anglophone nations, its implications to foreign language education in
   higher education have not been fully explored. The current article
   addresses this issue by shedding light on the conditions of teaching and
   learning of indigenous languages spoken in once-colonized regions of the
   world as an additional language for English speakers. More specifically,
   it examines how American students who participated in an eight-week
   YorA(1)ba study abroad program in Nigeria navigated a rather conspicuous
   gap between a monolingual utopia promoted by the program and the complex
   translingual realities of everyday language use outside of the
   classroom. Through the review of the perspectives of students with
   diverse backgrounds, the article discusses the significance of taking
   sociohistorical and geopolitical contexts surrounding the target
   language into account to cultivate informed learners.},

   the difference between voters of the far-right and the center-right
   party. The effects persisted for at least a month, and, as a byproduct,
   the intervention also reduced antipathy toward refugees, another
   stigmatized group in Hungary, and decreased vote intentions for
   Hungary's overtly racist, far-right party by 10\%. Our study offers a
   proof-of-concept for a general class of interventions that could be

Abstract = {This article seeks to develop Translanguaging as a theory of language

   transcend the boundaries between named languages, language varieties,
   and language and other semiotic systems. I highlight the contributions
   Translanguaging as a theoretical concept can make to the debates over
   the Language and Thought and the Modularity of Mind hypotheses. One
   particular aspect of multilingual language users' social interaction
   that I want to emphasize is its multimodal and multisensory nature. I
   elaborate on two related concepts: Translanguaging Space and
   Translanguaging Instinct, to underscore the necessity to bridge the
   artificial and ideological divides between the so-called sociocultural
   and the cognitive approaches to Translanguaging practices. In doing so,
   I respond to some of the criticisms and confusions about the notion of
   Translanguaging.},

Abstract = {This paper examines the 2016 US presidential election campaign to

   firms and academics during the globally leading technology conference,
   South-by-South West, in March 2017. We further argue that what is most
   significant about the contemporary fake news furore is what it portends:
   the use of personally and emotionally targeted news produced by
   algo-journalism and what we term ``empathic media{''}. In assessing
   solutions to this democratically problematic situation, we recommend
   that greater attention is paid to the role of digital advertising in
   causing, and combating, both the contemporary fake news phenomenon, and
   the near-horizon variant of empathically optimised automated fake news.},

   these nonlinear probability models and, particularly, to difficulties in
   interpreting their parameters. In this review, we draw on that
   literature to explain the problems, show how they manifest themselves in
   research, discuss the strengths and weaknesses of alternatives that have
   been suggested, and point to lines of further analysis.},

Journal = {RESEARCH ON LANGUAGE AND SOCIAL INTERACTION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {51},
Number = {1},
Pages = {52-66},
Abstract = {Children's whining is identified in extracts of video-recorded social
   interaction at home with siblings, parents, and other family. Whining is
   primarily a vernacular category, but it can be identified in terms of a
   set of phonetic features including pitch movement, loudness and
   nasality, and contrasted with crying. We focus on the uses and
   consequences of whining, in and for social interaction. Rather than
   identifying and attributing experiential causes or correlates of
   whining, we examine what children do with it, how it is occasioned, and
   how others, mostly parents, respond to it. Whining performs actions such
   as objecting to transgressions and thwarted goals and making complaints.
   Parental reactions include one or more of: stance inversion, which is
   the adoption of a contrasting tone in next turn; formulations of the
   offending circumstances; orientations to remedying the problem; and
   rejection of the whine's basis, including dispositional formulations of
   the child's whining (e.g., being grumpy) and accounts for not complying
   with a called-for remedy. Data are in English.},

Abstract = {This article navigates the findings of conversation analysis,

   what we know about the grammar-body interface. It shows how grammar is
   fitted to sequences and trajectories of embodied activities, as well as
   deployed interchangeably with bodily displays, resulting in truly
   multimodal patterns that emerge in real time. These findings
   problematize both the paradigmatic and syntagmatic structures documented
   in verbal-only linguistics. They call for a reconceptualization of
   grammar as an assembly of routinized methods for the organization of
   vocal conduct, capable of incorporating aspects of participants' bodily
   behavior. Data are in Estonian, French, German, Italian, Japanese and

Journal = {DIGITAL JOURNALISM},

Volume = {6},
Number = {6},
Pages = {719-736},
Abstract = {After prediction-defying elections in 2015 and 2016 in the United
   Kingdom and the United States rattled journalists, some publicly blamed
   data journalism-an indictment that raised questions about journalistic
   discourse surrounding the polysemic phrase and still-developing field. A
   content analysis (n = 612) of all published news stories over two years
   in four international news databases revealed the potential of
   journalists to embrace data as an empirical tool, for the phrase was
   most frequently associated with numerical analysis. However, the next
   most-frequent definitional category was electoral prediction, which was
   statistically more likely in the nations where data journalism is most
   often practiced, the U.K. and U.S. Correlating data journalism with
   electoral prediction also was statistically more likely in the month
   immediately after the surprising elections. Further, it was more likely
   to stimulate pushback from practitioners who saw data as
   epistemologically less reliable than ``shoe-leather{''} approaches
   marked by observation and interviews with a few people perceived to be
   voter archetypes. The results reveal more than journalistic ignorance
   about polling techniques. They reveal an element of news culture that
   privileges traditional methods and dismisses unfamiliar evidentiary
   tools, which risks skewing audience understanding of data journalism.},

Volume = {6},

Pages = {1165-1185},
Abstract = {This article considers how, and why, ``Topic Modelling{''} tools can be
   used to analyse historical newspaper archives. While a growing number of
   media and communication studies projects have applied these techniques
   to corpuses of born-digital journalism, using the same tools to analyse
   large-scale collections of historical newspapers requires us to overcome
   additional technological and methodological challenges. Our discussion
   is framed around a historical case study examining references to the
   United States in the 19th Century British Library Newspaper Archive. The
   article begins by highlighting the problems that researchers of both
   digital and historical journalism face when attempting to deal with an
   enormous body of evidence. Next, it argues that Topic Modelling offers
   one potential solution to these problems by providing a way to ``distant
   read{''} the archive. The remainder of the article is divided into five
   experiments that demonstrate how Topic Modelling can be applied to a
   series of research questions, each of which is applicable to other
   projects that might make use of newspaper archives. As well as
   demonstrating the investigative potential of topic modelling, the
   article also highlights the practical and technological barriers that
   currently undermine its effectiveness, particularly when it is applied
   to archives of historical material.},

Journal = {DIGITAL JOURNALISM},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {6},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {418-435},
Abstract = {A number of social, technological, and economic shifts over the past two
   decades have led to the proliferation of audience analytics and metrics
   in journalism. This article contends that we are witnessing a third wave
   toward the rationalization of audience understanding and distinguishes
   between audience analytics (systems that capture information) and
   audience metrics (quantified measures output by those systems). The body
   of literature on analytics and metrics in the context of news production
   is then synthesized across the ABCDE of news production: attitudes,
   behaviors, content, discourse, and ethics. That synthesis leads to an
   overarching conclusion that while contemporary journalism is not being
   driven by quantified audiences, both audiences and quantification are
   playing far more prominent roles in news production than in the past.
   Scholars and practitioners have also become less pessimistic about
   analytics and metrics over time, recognizing more nuanced effects and
   prosocial possibilities. Finally, important gaps in the literature are
   identified and new research directions proposed to help address them.},

Journal = {APPLIED LINGUISTICS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {38},
Number = {6},
Pages = {800-823},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {This article explores the fit between orthodox ideas about intercultural
   language education and situations of acute insecurity. It describes the
   teaching of Turkish to Greek-Cypriots, introduced in 2003 by the
   Republic of Cyprus as part of a de-securitization policy. Although these
   classes were optional, many students regarded Turks as enemies, and
   after documenting hostility itself as one motive for learning Turkish,
   we describe three teaching strategies used to deal with the powerful
   emotions that Turkish evoked: (i) focusing on the language as a code,
   shorn of any cultural association; (ii) treating it as a local language;
   and (iii) presenting it as a contemporary international language in a
   cosmopolitan ambience that potentially transcended the island-specific
   conflict. In this way, the Cypriot case calls mainstream language
   teaching assumptions into question: exclusively grammar-focused
   pedagogies display acute cultural sensitivity, and images of language in
   a globalized world look radical and innovative. For intercultural
   language education more generally, it is the combination of
   institutionalised language learning as a distinct cultural activity with
   the ideological plasticity of language itself that seems especially
   valuable.},

Abstract = {Scholars have long observed that presidential communication about a
   marginalized group can help shape that group's reality. Yet most
   analyses of such communication focus on a relatively small number of
   texts, making it difficult to identify important changes over time and
   analyze factors that might explain those changes. The present study
   proposes an analytic framework that specifies 4 measurable parameters of
   presidential communication about marginalized groups, as well as 4
   explanatory factors. We use this framework to analyze the census of
   presidents' formal communications about the LGBT community. Results
   highlight presidents' limited communicative engagement with the LGBT
   community and the roles that political party, rhetorical context, public
   opinion, and sociocultural touchstones play in explaining presidential
   communication about this important group.},

Number = {4},

Abstract = {This article evaluates Jurgen Habermas's attempt to reopen political
   liberalism to religion. In trying to take religion seriously, Habermas
   goes further than John Rawls and other liberal theorists by affirming
   that religious traditions articulate truths on which democratic
   societies continue to depend for their civic and moral health.
   Post-secular societies, in his view, should learn from religion by
   translating its moral intuitions into universal secular language.
   Although Habermas in this way appears friendlier to religion than Rawls,
   unlike Rawls he also calls for the modernization of religious
   consciousness. This theological transformation not only reveals the
   foundationalist presuppositions of liberalism, but also points to a
   highly attenuated conception of learning from religion. Taking religion
   seriously will require us to be open to its insights not only when they
   agree with, but especially when they challenge, our secular
   presuppositions. This dimension of religion is at risk of getting lost
   in translation in the Habermasian paradigm.},

Abstract = {The trial and execution of Louis XVI served as a founding act of French
   republican democracy. It was also a scene of irregular justice: no legal
   warrants or procedural precedents existed for bringing a king to justice
   before the law. This essay describes how Jacobins crafted a new language
   of popular agency to overcome that obstaclethe language of redemptive
   violence. Although redemptive violence had roots in prerevolutionary
   notions of penal justice and social cohesion, its philosophical
   ambitions were revolutionary and modern. Analyzing that language
   illuminates how republican democracy weaponized a distinctive ideology
   of extralegal violence at its origins. It also helps explain redemptive
   violence's enduring appeal during and after the French Revolution.},

Volume = {38},

Abstract = {Content and Language Integrated Learning (CLIL) programmes are
   burgeoning in European school contexts due to the widespread belief that
   they help to significantly improve foreign language learning while
   content learning is not negatively affected. However, some of its
   purported benefits still need to be empirically confirmed. Thus, while
   this approach is widely believed to positively influence students'
   affective stance, research studies are scant, and hardly any are
   longitudinal in nature. In an attempt to fill this gap, the present
   longitudinal study aims to analyse the impact of CLIL on different
   affective components. The participants are 304 secondary education
   students who were enrolled in CLIL and non-CLIL programmes. Contrary to
   expectations and the reviewed literature, the downward motivational
   trend observed in non-CLIL students in previous studies was not found.
   The results also indicate that CLIL does not help to sustain students'
   motivation over time, but motivation to learn the subject matter is
   maintained in CLIL classes.},

Abstract = {In institutional settings of globalization, labelled languages are

   English is treated as an invariable `ad hoc' idiom in the Belgian asylum
   interview, this article demonstrates how institutional measures and
   routines relating to multilingualism fail to address the communicative
   needs and practices of the participants involved. I argue that by
   privileging the variety of the host institution as a means to monitor
   all incoming Englishes, the institution perpetuates traditional-though
   academically contested-centre-periphery categorizations of global
   Englishes. I proceed by discussing how the divergent potentialities of
   the speakers' linguistic repertoires reflect a remarkable inversion of
   client-gatekeeper resources in the way the participants with the least
   linguistic resources in the interview process eventually have the power
   to act as arbiters of what is or is not institutionally relevant for the

Abstract = {Anti-Islamic sentiments have become central to right-wing populist
   mobilization in Western societies, which often results in negative
   portrayals of Muslims in political campaigns. Although these portrayals
   may have detrimental effects on minority members' identity formation and
   attitudes toward majority members, little is known about their effects
   on members of the depicted group. A lab experiment with 145 young
   Muslims reveals that right-wing populist ad exposure increases perceived
   discrimination, which in turn decreases individuals' self-esteem and
   national identification, and encourages hostility toward majority
   members. Religious identification, in contrast, is not affected by ad
   exposure. Implications of these findings for intergroup relations and
   democratic processes are discussed.},

Journal = {APPLIED LINGUISTICS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {38},
Number = {4},
Pages = {463-488},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Most of the world's population has knowledge of at least two languages.
   Many of these bilinguals are also exposed to and identify with at least
   two cultures. Because language knowledge enables participation in
   cultural practices and expression of cultural beliefs, bilingual
   experience and cultural identity are interconnected. However, the
   specific links between bilingualism and cultural identity remain largely
   unidentified. The current study examined which aspects of bilingualism
   relate to identification with first-and second-language cultures. Two
   hundred and nine bilinguals completed a questionnaire probing linguistic
   background and cultural affiliations. Regression analyses indicated that
   cultural identification was predicted by age of language acquisition,
   language proficiency, foreign accentedness, and contexts of long-term
   language immersion and current language exposure. Follow-up analyses
   revealed that the language-culture relations were mediated by the age
   and manner in which the second language was acquired. These findings are
   situated within a proposed framework of bilingual cultural identity. By
   identifying features of bilingualism that are relevant for cultural
   identity, the current research increases our understanding of the
   relationship between language and culture.},

Abstract = {Do adults learn the same syntactic second language (L2) form explicitly
   and implicitly simultaneously during meaning-based exposure, and does
   the type of learning (explicit and/or implicit) affect subsequent
   performance. In this study, 81 anglophones completed comprehension tasks
   providing incidental exposure to a semi-artificial language (English
   lexis, German syntax). A surprise grammaticality-judgement test (GJT)
   measured performance with the novel syntax. Source attributions and
   verbal reports provided information on type of learning (implicit and/or
   explicit), which were analysed in an exploratory fashion to classify
   within-participant implicit and explicit learning. Sixty-three
   participants demonstrated both types of learning, which suggests that
   extant binary classifications of type of learning may be inadequate.
   Furthermore, there were no significant performance differences on the
   GJT based on type of learning despite poor performance overall. The
   interpretation of the findings considers within-participant explicit and
   implicit learning measures and research issues when comparing the
   effectiveness of initial explicit learning and implicit learning on

Abstract = {The aim of this article is to explore the connections between the
   concepts of the linguistic repertoire, of language ideologies, and of
   lived experience of language. In foregrounding the concept of
   Spracherleben, the lived experience of language, this article
   contributes to the ongoing debate on how to rethink the notion of the
   linguistic repertoire considering that current phenomena such as
   increased mobility, migration, or participation in transnational
   networks of communication make it difficult to take, as Gumperz (1964)
   did in his original concept, relatively stable speech communities as
   point of departure. The notion of the lived experience of language which
   I am elaborating here emphasizes the intersubjective dimension of
   language as a gesture toward the other and casts light on the
   often-neglected bodily and emotional dimensions of perception and
   speech. Attaching particular importance to the perspective of the
   experiencing subject, the concept is based on phenomenological
   approaches, as developed in the 1940s by the French philosopher
   Merleau-Ponty.},

Volume = {61},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Active research on a wide range of political contexts centers on
   ethnicity's role in collective action. Many theories posit that
   information flows more easily in ethnically homogeneous areas,
   facilitating collective action, because social networks among coethnics
   are denser. Although this characterization is ubiquitous, little
   empirical work assesses it. Through a novel field experiment in a
   matched pair of villages in rural Uganda, this article directly examines
   word-of-mouth information spread and its relationship to ethnic
   diversity and networks. As expected, information spread more widely in
   the homogeneous village. However, unexpectedly, the more diverse
   village's network is significantly denser. Using unusually detailed
   network data, we offer an explanation for why network density may hamper
   information dissemination in heterogeneous areas, showing why even
   slight hesitation to share information with people from other groups can
   have large aggregate effects.},

Title = {Translation Between L2 Acquisition and L1 Attrition: Anaphora Resolution

Journal = {APPLIED LINGUISTICS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {38},
Number = {1},

Abstract = {This article reports on the findings of an empirical study that relates
   translation studies and research on language acquisition/attrition by
   looking at the interpretation of overt pronominal subjects, previously
   found to be problematic in both domains. The focus is on the resolution
   of intra-sentential anaphora and cataphora in Italian by two groups of
   native speakers, English-Italian trainee translators and a control group
   of non-translators. The participants did a picture selection task in
   which they had to identify the antecedents of third person null and
   overt subject pronouns in ambiguous anaphoric and cataphoric conditions.
   Contrary to what was expected based on previous work, proposing that
   translators undergo a form of first language attrition due to extended
   exposure to a second language, trainee translators did not exhibit
   evidence of overt pronoun overgeneralization (i. e. second language
   influence). In fact, they selected pragmatically inappropriate
   antecedents to a lesser extent than the control group, leading to the
   conclusion that in language comprehension, metalinguistic awareness can
   override other influences affecting translators.},

Journal = {COMMUNICATION METHODS AND MEASURES},

Volume = {11},
Number = {2},
Pages = {105-120},
Abstract = {Due to the fact that mediated associations are a central aspect of many
   mass communication theories, their measurement is of central interest
   for communication research. Mediated associations are defined as the
   repeated pairing of an object (e.g., social group, political party) with
   specific attributes (e.g., crime, economy). In this article, we
   introduce a recently developed, automated text-analytic technique. We
   present an application of this method in the media stereotyping domain
   via the content analysis of German news coverage of Islam. As predicted,
   the analysis revealed substantial mediated associations between
   Islam-related concepts and violence (e.g., ``Koran + violence{''}),
   terror (e.g., ``Islam + terror{''}), dehumanization (e.g., `` Muslims +
   animal-related terms{''}), and general negativity (valence). We discuss
   the promises and pitfalls of this method, make software suggestions, and
   provide application-related information for speedy dissemination in
   communication research.},

   best measure public opinion through polls. This article is a call for
   political scientists to be more self-conscious about the choices we make
   when we attempt to measure public opinion with surveys in two realms. I
   first take up the question of whom to interview, discussing the major
   challenges survey researchers face when sampling respondents from the
   population of interest. I then discuss the level of specificity with
   which we can properly collect information about the political
   preferences of individuals. I focus on the types of question wording and
   item aggregation strategies researchers can use to accurately measure

   were indeed timed to the end of TCUs. Also, long blinks were more likely
   than short blinks to occur during mutual gaze, with nods or continuers,
   and their occurrence was restricted to sequential contexts in which
   signaling understanding was particularly relevant, suggesting a special
   signaling capacity of long blinks.},

Journal = {DIGITAL JOURNALISM},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {5},
Number = {7},
Pages = {850-867},
Abstract = {The emergence of blogging and citizen journalism has created challenges
   in defining the once-simple terms of ``journalist{''} and ``news
   media{''}. Internationally, courts, legislators and policy makers are
   developing new definitions that incorporate a broader understanding of
   journalism practice, as territories blur and shift across digital
   spaces. However, a lack of consensus has resulted in jurisdictional
   clashes, challenges to legislative amendments, appeals to higher courts,
   and confusion for regulators and practitioners alike. In Australia,
   recently legislated shield laws have resulted in different definitions
   across the country's various jurisdictions. In the United States, court
   cases relating to defamation and shield laws have been successfully
   appealed based on differing definitions of the role of a journalist. In
   New Zealand, a High Court judgement overturned a lower court decision,
   to find that a blogger could be viewed as a journalist. At the same
   time, courts internationally are developing policies and guidelines
   relating to live text-based communication from courts, which also
   requires them to determine who is permitted to text, tweet or blog from
   within courtroom. This paper examines how these courts, legislators and
   policy makers are grappling with the challenges of redefining
   ``journalist{''} and ``news media{''} while ultimately focusing on the
   objective of ensuring a free and democratic flow of information.},

Abstract = {In this article, we examine gaze direction in responses to polar

   methods. The data come from a novel corpus of conversations in which
   participants wore eye-tracking glasses to obtain direct measures of
   their eye movements. The results show that while most preferred
   responses are produced with gaze toward the questioner, most
   dispreferred responses are produced with gaze aversion. We further
   demonstrate that gaze aversion by respondents can occasion self-repair
   by questioners in the transition space between turns, indicating that
   the relationship between gaze direction and preference is more than a
   mere statistical association. We conclude that gaze direction in
   responses to polar questions functions as a signal of response
   preference. Data are in American, British, and Canadian English.},

   manually coded data, also for less manifest contents. While scale

Title = {CRYPTIC JOURNALISM News reporting of encryption},
Journal = {DIGITAL JOURNALISM},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {5},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {299-317},
Abstract = {In light of Edward Snowden's global surveillance disclosures, this
   article examines news discourses about online communication security and
   surveillance circumvention practices. It analyses 1249 news reports
   mentioning encryption in The Guardian and The New York Times, covering a
   three-year period from June 2012 to June 2015 (one year before and two
   years after the Snowden revelations). Whilst there was a marked increase
   in the volume of news articles mentioning encryption post-Snowden, the
   context in which encryption is discussed has since shifted from an
   initial emphasis on ``surveillance{''} towards ``security{''} issues.
   However, the research found that greater news coverage of encryption did
   not necessarily mean an increase in depth of coverage, with most
   mentions of encryption vague and non-descript. In terms of source usage,
   the research finds an emphasis on private corporations in both
   publications analysed. This is problematic when many of the
   organisations allowed to speak on encryption were those accused of
   colluding with the US and UK Governments to aid covert mass
   surveillance-the likes of Google, Facebook, Apple, Microsoft and so
   forth-thus providing them with a platform to exonerate themselves from
   the accusations. This contradictory depiction of communication security
   serves the status quo and prevents advancement of the `` encrypted by
   default{''} communication practice called for by Snowden. This, by
   extension, has serious implications for both journalistic freedom and
   civil liberties since it helps to perpetuate the ability of nation
   states and corporations to conduct indiscriminate mass surveillance.},

Abstract = {Computational text analysis has become an exciting research field with
   many applications in communication research. It can be a difficult
   method to apply, however, because it requires knowledge of various
   techniques, and the software required to perform most of these
   techniques is not readily available in common statistical software
   packages. In this teacher's corner, we address these barriers by
   providing an overview of general steps and operations in a computational
   text analysis project, and demonstrate how each step can be performed
   using the R statistical software. As a popular open-source platform, R
   has an extensive user community that develops and maintains a wide range
   of text analysis packages. We show that these packages make it easy to
   perform advanced text analytics.},

Abstract = {This is an activity-theoretic study of agency and identity in the study
   abroad experiences of a Korean learner named Julie-a 50-year-old
   lesbian, feminist, and non-traditional student from the USA. During
   6-weeks in Seoul, Julie struggled to gain participation and to define
   her identity in a setting that was hostile towards homosexuality. These
   struggles were exacerbated by her Korean class, where she was positioned
   as an `older' student and, therefore, consigned to working with a
   `sexist' and `narcissistic' 65-year-old European male ('Peter'). Within
   this unfavourable socio-historical context, this study focuses on how
   Julie exerted her agency to modulate her identity and redefine the
   socialmaterial conditions of her language learning. I argue that through
   exerting her agency Julie was able to alter the `rules of interaction'
   in the `activity system' that she was part of. As such, Julie's story
   highlights the significance of acts of `changing' in defining language
   learning experiences and emphasizes the role of agency in
   activity-theoretic approaches to language learning.},

Journal = {AMERICAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {81},
Number = {6},
Pages = {1223-1250},

Abstract = {The negative outcomes associated with cultural stereotypes based on
   race, class, and gender and related schema-consistency biases are well
   documented. How these biases become culturally entrenched is less well
   understood. In particular, previous research has neglected the role of
   information transmission processes in perpetuating cultural biases. In
   this study, I combine insights from the cultural cognition, affect
   control theory, and cultural transmission frameworks to examine how one
   form of internalized culturefundamental cultural sentimentsaffects the
   content of information shared in communication. I argue that individuals
   communicate narratives in ways that minimize deflection of internalized
   cultural sentiments, resulting in cultural-consistency bias. I test this
   proposition using a serial transmission study in which participants read
   and retell short stories. Results show that culturally inconsistent,
   high-deflection information experiences an initial boost in
   memorability, but consistency biases ultimately win out as information
   is altered to increase cultural consistency, demonstrating that
   deflection provides a promising measure of cultural schema-consistency.
   This measure is predictive of the information that individuals share in
   communication and changes to this information in the transmission
   process.},

Abstract = {Is our moral cognition ``colored{''} by the language(s) that we speak?
   Despite the centrality of language to political life and agency, limited
   attempts have been made thus far in contemporary political philosophy to

   influence of linguistic relativity effects on political thinking in
   linguistically diverse societies. We begin by introducing the facts and
   fallacies of the ``linguistic relativity{''} principle, and explore the
   various ways in which they ``color, ``often covertly, current normative
   debates. To illustrate this, we focus on two key Rawlsian concepts: the
   original position and public reason. We then move to consider the
   resulting epistemic challenges and opportunities facing contemporary
   multilingual democratic societies in an age of increased mobility,
   arguing for the consequent imperative of developing political
   metalinguistic awareness and political extelligence among political
   scientists, political philosophers, and political actors alike in an
   irreducibly complex linguistic world.},

Abstract = {This article highlights a gap between a great deal of constitutional
   theory and a great deal of the practice of democratic
   constitution-making. Drawing on data from democratic national and state
   constitutions, we challenge the consensus among constitutional theorists
   that a central purpose of constitutionalism is the entrenchment (the
   fortification against future change) of broad principles. The empirical
   reality is that the majority of democratic constitutions today are
   subject to frequent revision, and are therefore ill-equipped to
   facilitate the entrenchment of their contents. To explore the logic of
   these unentrenched documents, we identify the historical periods in
   which different geographic regions moved away from highly entrenched
   constitutions, and we examine the political contexts of these
   transformations. We find that, in each context, constitution-makers were
   attempting to limit the discretion of constitutional interpreters and
   implementers by drafting highly specific texts and by updating them in
   response to continually changing circumstances.},

Abstract = {Language aptitude remains one of the most understudied predictor
   variables in L1 attrition research. The current study seeks to address
   this gap by investigating the effects of language aptitude on L1
   retention in late attriters. Forty L1 Spanish - L2 Swedish bilinguals
   living in Sweden participated in the study, along with 20 functionally
   monolingual L1 speakers of Spanish. L1 proficiency was measured by means
   of a grammaticality judgement test (GJT) and language aptitude data were
   obtained through the LLAMA Language Aptitude Test (Meara 2005).
   Additional data on the participants' linguistic background were also
   collected. Results revealed a robust difference in GJT scores between
   the bilinguals and the control group. However, degree of language
   aptitude was not found to exert a significant influence on the
   bilinguals' GJT performance. Instead, the only significant predictor for
   GJT performance was linguistic identification, showing that those
   participants with strong L1 identification were more accurate in judging
   L1 grammaticality. The lack of aptitude effects on L1 attrition is
   discussed against the background of age-related attrition
   susceptibility.},

Abstract = {This article reports on the peer socialization of gendered Mandarin

   focuses on how gender is constructed and indexed through language as the
   American students learn to use Mandarin sentence-final particles.
   Sentence-final particles constitute a unique repertoire to achieve
   affective work in Mandarin. They have further become a resource among
   China's urban youth to enact a cute female speech style. In this case
   study, I employ a qualitative approach with an embedded quantitative
   component to examine the participants' use of the particles over the
   course of one semester. The findings show how the American students
   become socialized into using these particles as gendered linguistic
   practices in the dorm conversations.},

Abstract = {This article examines how participants in face-to-face conversation

   from their mobile or providing others with visual access to the device's
   display screen. Drawing from naturalistic video recordings, we focus on
   how mobile-supported sharing activities invite assessments by providing
   access to an object that is not locally accessible to the participants.
   Such practices make relevant coparticipants' assessment of these objects
   and allow for different forms of coparticipation across sequence types.
   We additionally examine how the organization of assessments during these
   sharing activities displays sensitivity to preference structure. The
   analysis illustrates the relevance of embodiment, local objects, and new
   communicative technologies to the production of action in copresent
   interaction. Data are in American English.},

Abstract = {The term `language management' has become a widely used expression in
   the sociolinguistic literature. Originally introduced by Jernudd and
   NeustupnA1/2 in 1987, as a novel continuation of the language planning
   tradition stemming from the 1960/70s, language management along these
   lines has developed into the Language Management Theory (LMT). A second
   definition of language management, diverting from LMT, can be found in
   the work of Spolsky, who treats language management as a theoretical
   component of the wider concept of language policy. Furthermore, over the
   past 15 years a number of scholars, particularly from the international
   management discipline, appear to have taken an interest in language as a
   variable in business and corporate management. It is also common to
   refer to this research field as language management. This conceptual
   article offers a theoretically based comparison of the three definitions
   of language management, before discussing five main focus points, which
   may be used to highlight their analytical differences.},

Abstract = {This article reports on the findings of a large-scale cross-sectional
   survey of the motivational disposition of English language learners in
   secondary schools and universities in China. The total sample involved
   over 10,000 students and was stratified according to geographical region

   locations. The investigation aims to present a balanced overview of the
   general level of L2 motivation in China through the lens of the L2
   Motivational Self System (Dornyei 2005, 2009). The wealth of data
   obtained in the survey provide solid empirical description of the main
   features of language learning in China, and the detailed information
   presented in the study can also serve as a baseline for future research
   conducted to investigate temporal, social, and geographical variation

Year = {2016},
Volume = {49},
Number = {3},
Pages = {272-288},
Month = {JUL-SEP},
Abstract = {Our analysis proceeds from the question that if grammar alone is
   insufficient to identify the action of an imperative (e.g., offering,
   directing, warning, begging, etc.), how can interlocutors come to
   recognize the specific action being performed by a given imperative? We
   argue that imperative directives that occur after the directed action
   could have first been relevantly performed explicitly to direct the
   actions of the recipient and tacitly treat the absence of the action as
   a failure for which the recipient is accountable. The tacit nature of
   the accountability orientation enables both parties to focus on
   restoring progressivity to the directed course of action rather than
   topicalizing a transgression. Data are from everyday interactions in
   British and American English.},

Abstract = {This article explores Adam Smith's attitude toward economic inequality,
   as distinct from the problem of poverty, and argues that he regarded it
   as a double-edged sword. On the one hand, as has often been recognized,
   Smith saw a high degree of economic inequality as an inevitable result
   of a flourishing commercial society, and he considered a certain amount
   of such inequality to be positively useful as a means of encouraging
   productivity and bolstering political stability. On the other hand, it
   has seldom been noticed that Smith also expressed deep worries about
   some of the other effects of extreme economic inequalityworries that
   are, moreover, interestingly different from those that dominate
   contemporary discourse. In Smith's view, extreme economic inequality
   leads people to sympathize more fully and readily with the rich than the
   poor, and this distortion in our sympathies in turn undermines both
   morality and happiness.},

Abstract = {The terror attack on the French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo in
   January 2015 serves to explore the role of religion and secularism in

   its recent criticisms and extensions, helps navigate normative dilemmas
   presented by the attacks. From a deliberative perspective, journalists
   should reprint Charlie cartoons that are perceived by Muslims as
   insulting and incendiary only if this fulfills a real need for public
   reflection and enlightenment. Media and the wider public should engage
   in differentiated solidarity with Charlie Hebdo, help transfer the
   hidden argumentative potential of its cartoons into the realm of truly
   argumentative discourse, and engage in metadeliberation that explicitly
   reflects the contexts and rules for public debate.},

   suggests that cop-watching represents a unique form of citizenship; one
   that combines text and practice to produce embodied narratives, which
   can give voice to the concerns of others. As a form of so-called
   sousveillance, cop-watching extends and complicates existing theories
   about surveillance, journalism, and visual evidence.},

Journal = {DIGITAL JOURNALISM},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {4},
Number = {4},
Pages = {494-511},
Abstract = {This article explores De Correspondent as a specific example of slow
   journalism that aims to establish an alternative for quality journalism
   governed by the objectivity regime. It offers an analysis of the way the
   platform redefines journalism's quality standards against the background
   of the tension between traditional modernistic claims to truth and
   competing postmodern ideas on the social construction of knowledge.
   Moreover, the article examines how these ideals are translated into
   journalistic texts. The article argues that both in its rhetoric and in
   its actual practice, the articles in De Correspondent deviate from the
   principles of quality journalism under the objectivity regime. They are
   structured around the mediating subjectivity of the journalists and are
   thus openly subjective. Yet, they also draw on empirical research and
   scientific knowledge. Moreover, they are transparent about the reporting
   process, which through their reflection becomes an integral part of the
   story itself. Thus, being transparent about their combination of
   different forms of knowledge, rooted in more traditional
   rational-positivistic inquiry as well as in personal experience and
   emotion, they try to reconcile the tension between the modernist and
   postmodernist claims to truth.},

Abstract = {Media exposure is one of the most important concepts in the social
   sciences, and yet scholars have struggled with how to operationalize it
   for decades. Some researchers have focused on the effects of variously
   worded self-report measures. Others advocate the use of aggregate and/or
   behavioral data that does not rely on a person's ability to accurately
   recall exposure. Our study illustrates how an experimental design can be
   used to improve measures of exposure. In particular, we show how an
   experimental benchmark can be employed to (1) compare actual (i.e.,
   manipulated) and self-reported values of news exposure; (2) assess how
   closely the self-reported items approximate the performance of
   ``true{''} exposure in an empirical application; and (3) investigate
   whether a variation in question wording improves the accuracy of
   self-reported exposure measures.},

Abstract = {This paper presents a case study of the possibilities of slow
   photojournalism. Over the past decade, award-winning photojournalist
   David Burnett has used a 60-year-old Speed Graphic film camera to
   document US political events, several Olympic Games, and the aftermath
   of Hurricane Katrina, among other projects. His photographs reveal a
   significantly different aesthetic from contemporary photojournalism and
   he is celebrated for the perspective his analog photographs offer. This
   analysis is based on two points of examination: first, a textual
   analysis of articles and videos discussing the work; and second, a
   semiotic analysis of the imagery. The examination suggests Burnett's
   photo aesthetic signifies a longing for an imagined analog, journalistic
   utopia of yore, where individual journalists had the time and freedom to
   put care and attention into their work.},

Title = {GOOGLING THE NEWS Opportunities and challenges in studying news events
   through Google Search},
Journal = {DIGITAL JOURNALISM},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {4},
Number = {1},
Pages = {107-124},
Abstract = {Search engines provide a window into the changing association between
   websites and keywords across cultures and countries and over time. As
   such, they offer journalism and news researchers an opportunity to study
   how search engines, in this case Google, mediate news events and stories
   online. However, search results are not straightforward to study. Since
   search results are made in the act of searching and will have to be
   retrieved from Google Search in real-time, there is a range of different
   ontological and methodological issues related to this data source. This
   paper addresses these issues by discussing how factors in the search
   algorithm can be used proactively to study variations across searchers
   and in time. The paper identifies various endogenous and exogenous
   factors in the search algorithm one has to pay attention to and
   discusses ways to archive search results accordingly. Through a small
   case study, ways to work with the influence of endogenous factors
   (keywords, language settings, geo-location, Web history and clicking
   behaviour) and mitigate the effects of the exogenous factors
   (experimentation and randomisation) are suggested. Then, a new approach
   to studying search results is put forward, which builds on purposeful
   sampling of real-world participants or constructed research profiles.
   Finally, perspectives for news and journalism scholars in studying
   algorithmically generated content in a broader context are offered.},

Abstract = {Visuals in news media help define, or frame issues, but less is known
   about how they influence opinions and behavior. The authors use an
   experiment to present image and text exemplars of frames from war and
   conflict news in isolation and in image-text congruent and incongruent
   pairs. Results show that, when presented alone, images generate stronger
   framing effects on opinions and behavioral intentions than text. When
   images and text are presented together, as in a typical news report, the
   frame carried by the text influences opinions regardless of the
   accompanying image, whereas the frame carried by the image drives
   behavioral intentions irrespective of the linked text. These effects are
   explained by the salience enhancing and emotional consequences of
   visuals.},

Abstract = {Under what circumstances do new constitutions promote democracy? Between
   1974 and 2011, the level of democracy increased in 62 countries
   following the adoption of a new constitution, but decreased or stayed
   the same in 70 others. Using data covering all 138 new constitutions in
   118 countries during that period, we explain this divergence through
   empirical tests showing that overall increased participation during the
   process of making the constitution positively impacts postpromulgation
   levels of democracy. Then, after disaggregating constitution-making into
   three stages (drafting, debating, and ratification) we find compelling
   evidence through robust statistical tests that the degree of citizen
   participation in the drafting stage has amuch greater impact on the
   resulting regime. This lends support to some core principles of
   ``deliberative{''} theories of democracy. We conclude that
   constitutional reformers should focus more on generating public ``buy
   in{''} at the front end of the constitution-making process, rather than
   concentrating on ratification and referendums at the ``back end{''} that
   are unlikely to correct for an ``original sin{''} of limited citizen
   deliberation during drafting.},

Abstract = {In this article, we present an analysis of closings in two counseling
   media: online, text-based exchanges (usually referred to as ``chat{''}
   sessions) and telephone calls. Previous research has found that the
   participant who initiated a conversation preferably also initiates its
   termination with a possible preclosing. Advice acknowledgments, lying in
   the epistemic domain of the client, are devices that may work as
   preclosings. However, in text-based chat clients regularly refrain from
   advice acknowledgment. While counselors use various practices to elicit
   advice acknowledgment in the context of potential advice resistance,
   hoaxing, and/or seemingly long pauses, these questions do not always
   succeed as ``closing devices.{''} This offers an explanation for
   counselors' perception of online chatting as more difficult than
   calling. The data are in Dutch with English translation.},

Pages = {326-344},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Research on the efficacy of second language (L2) pronunciation
   instruction has produced mixed results, despite reports of significant
   improvement in many studies. Possible explanations for divergent
   outcomes include learner individual differences, goals and foci of
   instruction, type and duration of instructional input, and assessment
   procedures. After identifying key concepts, we survey 75 L2
   pronunciation studies, particularly their methods and results. Despite a
   move towards emphasizing speech intelligibility and comprehensibility,
   most research surveyed promoted native-like pronunciation as the target.
   Although most studies entailed classroom instruction, many featured
   Computer Assisted Pronunciation Teaching (CAPT). Segmentals were studied
   more often than suprasegmentals. The amount of instruction required to
   effect change was related to researchers' goals; interventions focusing
   on a single feature were generally shorter than those addressing more

Journal = {LEADERSHIP QUARTERLY},

Volume = {26},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {436-447},

Abstract = {While substantial scholarly attention has been paid to the beneficial
   consequences of transformational leadership and the conditions in which
   this leadership style is most effective, there is a remarkable shortage
   of research on the contextual antecedents of transformational leadership
   behavior itself. To address this gap, a laboratory experiment was
   conducted in which we tested the relationship between task complexity
   and the emergence of transformational leadership behavior. In this
   experiment, 111 participants were divided in groups of three (comprising
   one leader and two subordinates), and were instructed to solve three
   decision-making tasks with varying levels of task complexity. Results
   indicated that task complexity was negatively related to
   transformational leadership behavior, and that this relationship was
   partially mediated by the leader's state core self-evaluations. In other
   words, when leaders encounter tasks that are overwhelmingly complex,
   they act in less transformational ways because they momentarily lack the
   psychological resources to do so. Limitations and future research
   directions are discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {In examining how framing influences an audience's appreciation of
   products, practices, and people, including the framer, we take the
   perspective of the audience that evaluates the framing. We examine the
   effects of framing on evaluations when audiences are exposed to a
   multiplicity of frames, both by the same actor as the result of
   recurrent communications over time and by multiple actors who vie for
   attention. Using 36,012 research reports by securities analysts,
   covering the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industry between 1989 and
   2012, we tested the relationships between analysts' framing repertoires
   and professional investors' evaluations of analysts as measured in the
   publication of Institutional Investor's short list of the best analysts
   of the year. We found that investors appreciate analysts with framing
   repertoires that resonate with their needs, that are internally coherent
   over time, and that offer a moderate amount of novelty in comparison to
   others' framings. We also found that framing is particularly important
   for analysts without existing high status, that is, who have never
   before been recognized as stars or who cannot benefit from association
   with a prestigious employer.},

Abstract = {Diagnostic language assessment has received increased research interest
   in recent years, with particular attention on methods through which
   diagnostic information can be gleaned from standardized proficiency
   tests. However, diagnostic procedures in the broader sense have been
   inadequately theorized to date, with the result that there is still
   little agreement on precisely what diagnosis in second and foreign
   language learning actually entails. In order to address this problem,
   this article investigated how diagnosis is theorized and carried out in
   a diverse range of professions with a view to finding commonalities that
   can be applied to the context of language assessment. Ten
   semi-structured interviews were conducted with professionals from the
   fields of car mechanics, IT systems support, medicine, psychology and
   education. Data were then coded, yielding five macro-categories that fit
   the entire data set: (i) definitions of diagnosis, (ii) means of
   diagnosis,(iii) key players, (iv) diagnostic procedures, (v)
   treatment/follow-up. Based on findings within these categories, a set of
   five tentative principles of diagnostic language assessment is drawn-up,
   as well as a list of implications for future research.},

Abstract = {In the Social Contract, Rousseau declares that he has given up the idea
   of discussing the external relations of states. Yet numerous
   textsincluding a recently reconstituted work about the law of warshow
   that he thought very seriously about the question of the nature and
   origin of war and of the possibility of making war subject to the rule
   of law. Rousseau, in contrast to Hobbes, links war's appearance to that
   of the sovereign states; the state of war is therefore the necessary
   result of international relations. Moreover, he considers the
   international law as chimerical. How can he then conceive a non-utopian
   theory of just war? My hypothesis is that his conception of the law of
   war is deduced from principles of internal political law and arises from
   pragmatic necessity. The state that discredits itself in its manner of
   waging war weakens itself while believing that it is reinforcing itself.},

Journal = {APPLIED LINGUISTICS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {36},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The article explores `culture talk' at the outset of first-time
   encounters between teachers and students of English as a foreign
   language in the conversation lounge of a Japanese university. It
   analyses the interactional procedures by which the foreign place of
   origin of the teacher becomes the topic of conversation following his or
   her initial categorization by the Japanese students, for example, so you
   are from England'. In doing so, it draws on Maynard and Zimmerman's
   (1984) analytic framework of pre-topical sequences used by unacquainted
   participants to uncover other-identifying information. This is
   reclassified to accommodate the prior knowledge of the Japanese students
   of the teachers' foreign origins, as emergent in categorization. Having
   been granted the pre-allocated right to nominate topic through
   guidelines on use of the lounge, the students further adopt a
   wanting-to-know framing of conversation, by which they orient to the
   teacher's own expertise, as rooted in his or her biographical
   information preserve (Goffman 1971). Knowledge of the foreign country is
   seen to be asymmetrically distributed by the participants, with
   observably reductive effects on both interactional dynamics and cultural
   representation.},

Abstract = {Epistemics in interaction refers to how participants display, manage,
   and orient to their own and others' states of knowledge. This article
   applies recent conversation analytical work on epistemics to classrooms
   where language and content instruction are combined. It focuses on
   Epistemic Search Sequences (ESSs) through which students in peer
   interaction collectively resolve emerging knowledge gaps while working
   on pedagogic tasks. ESSs are initiated when a speaker displays an
   `unknowing' epistemic stance by making an information request about some
   aspect of language or the content being worked on. We examine three
   different types of ESS: those in which a `knowing' response is accepted
   by the initiator of the sequence; those in which there is an `unknowing'
   response; and those where `knowing' responses are contested. The
   findings have implications for understanding peer interaction in
   content-based classrooms in three areas: the affordances of peer
   interaction for learning in contrast with teacher-led `known-answer'
   sequences; how learners manage rights and responsibilities around
   knowing or not knowing; and how learners discover and work on their own
   learning objects.},

Volume = {36},
Number = {1},

Abstract = {This article explores attitudes and response to language selection in
   advertising targeting Italian bilinguals who belong to a defined speech
   community. The research builds upon (i) research on multilingual
   advertising by investigating its attitudinal correlates, and (ii)
   studies on advertising to bilinguals through the verification of the
   presence of processing fluency effects among Italian English bilinguals
   in Australia. Results drawn from a focus group show that attitudes
   towards the two languages are shaped both by the consideration of the
   audience's bilingualism and the socio-psychological features the
   languages carry. Further data collected through a 2 (language of
   advertisements: English versus Italian) x 2 (language dominance: English
   versus Italian) between-subject experiment particularize these findings.
   A total of 103 circumstantial bilinguals of Italian descent evaluated
   four print advertisements. Arguably due to their high level of
   proficiency, subjects do not experience any processing fluency effect
   when exposed to advertising in their dominant language. On the contrary,
   English dominants respond more favourably to messages in Italian whereas
   Italian dominants respond more favourably to messages in English.},

Abstract = {The universe of journalism has always consisted of interspersed texts,
   practices and meanings. Yet, much journalism research has often isolated
   either texts and/or contexts and thus assumed relations between
   professional practices, informed (rational) readers and (conceived) core
   texts. It is, however, more important than ever to shift attention away
   from texts to the processes through which they are circulated. This is
   partly because the many cultural forms of journalism (textual,
   institutional, technological, material, behavioural and imagined) are
   undergoing significant changes, one of which is being interrelated in
   new and increasingly complex ways. To understand some of the related
   processes, this article proposes a notion of circulation that implies a
   close attention to the ways in which the various forms of this landscape
   travel, intertwine and connect and, in particular, to the ways in which
   these forms construct and maintain what is termed cultures of
   circulation. In order to approach such processes, this article traces
   the photographic mediation of a specific event with the overall aim of
   beginning a theorization of the landscape of journalism as interrelated
   cultures of circulation.},

Title = {WAITING FOR DATA JOURNALISM A qualitative assessment of the anecdotal
   take-up of data journalism in French-speaking Belgium},
Journal = {DIGITAL JOURNALISM},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {3},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {432-446},
Abstract = {Data journalism has emerged as a trend worthy of attention in newsrooms
   the world over. Previous research has highlighted how elite media,
   journalism education institutions, and other interest groups take part
   in the emergence and evolution of data journalism. But has it equally
   gained momentum in smaller, less-scrutinized media markets? This paper
   looks at the ascent of data journalism in the French-speaking part of
   Belgium. It argues that journalism, and hence data journalism, can be
   understood as a socio-discursive practice: it is not only the production
   of (data-driven) journalistic artefacts that shapes the notion of (data)
   journalism, but also the discursive efforts of all the actors involved,
   in and out of the newsrooms. A set of qualitative inquiries allowed us
   to examine the phenomenon by first establishing a cartography of who and
   what counts as data journalism. It uncovers an overall reliance on a
   handful of passionate individuals, only partly backed up
   institutionally, and a limited amount of consensual references that
   could foster a shared interpretive community. A closer examination of
   the definitions reveal a sharp polyphony that is particularly polarized
   around the duality of the term itself, divided between a focus on data
   and a focus on journalism, and torn between the co-existing notions of
   ``ordinary{''} and ``thorough{''} data journalism. We also describe what
   is perceived as obstacles, which mostly pertain to broader traits that
   shape contemporary news-making; and explain why, if data journalism
   clearly exists as a matter of concern, it has not transformed in
   concrete undertakings.},

Title = {THE NOTION OF THE ``BLURRING BOUNDARIES{''} Journalism as a (de-)
   differentiated phenomenon},
Journal = {DIGITAL JOURNALISM},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {3},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {68-84},
Abstract = {The notion of the ``blurring boundaries{''} has become a flashy label to
   characterize the way journalism is manifestly changing in the age of the
   internet. This article explores this idea of de-boundedness and
   discusses the question whether there is anything more behind it than a
   catch-all diagnosis for the processes of change and transformation in
   the circumstances of communication in society, in general, and for
   journalism, in particular. To this end, de-boundedness as a proposition
   initially receives a more concrete definition. Its foundations in
   theories of differentiation and especially in the theory of social
   systems by the German sociologist Niklas Luhmann will be discussed,
   where differentiation, that is, drawing lines of demarcation, is the
   essential factor. It is shown that systems theory provides different
   possibilities for characterizing forms of de-differentiation or
   ``blurring boundaries{''}. Within systems theory they can be interpreted
   in terms of the evolutionary emergence of new forms of journalism, the
   co-evolutionary processes between journalism and its environment and/or
   as interpenetrations of journalism with other societal systems. It is
   demonstrated that changes in journalism oscillate between
   differentiation and de-differentiation, so that it can be described as a
   (de-) differentiated phenomenon.},

Title = {AUDIENCE PERCEPTIONS OF EDITING QUALITY Assessing traditional news
   routines in the digital age},
Journal = {DIGITAL JOURNALISM},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {3},
Number = {6},
Pages = {832-849},
Abstract = {The technological and social upheaval that did such damage to the
   economic structure of professional journalism has had some of its
   greatest impact on positions that, even if they did not produce original
   words or pictures, were essential to the smooth functioning of the
   assembly line of news. If off-the-shelf posting software with a built-in
   spell-checking function is all that need stand between the audience and
   a stream of fresh-if unmediated-content, is there a future for the
   technical, practical or even ethical skills that the copy editor brought
   to journalism? This study uses a lab experiment to address whether and
   how traditional editing processes affect audience perceptions of the
   quality, professionalism, and value of news articles. Articles were
   presented in a mixed design in which participants saw four articles in
   the edited condition and four in the unedited condition. Results
   indicate that standard newsroom editing practices have a significant
   positive effect on a digital audience's perceptions of news quality and
   of whether material is worth paying for.},
