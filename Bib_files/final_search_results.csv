We argue that citizens' impolite and/or uncivil behavior is one possible explanation for such decisions. Social media conversations are rife with harassment and politicians are a prime target. This alters the incentive structure of engaging in dialogue on social media. We use Spanish, Greek, German, and U.K. candidates' tweets sent during the run-up to the recent European Parliament elections, and rely on automated text analysis and machine learning methods to measure their level of civility. Our contribution is an actor-oriented theory of political dialogue that incorporates Twitter's specific affordances, clarifying how and why Twitter's democratic promise may be limited.","[Theocharis, Yannis; Popa, Sebastian Adrian] Univ Mannheim, Mannheim Ctr European Social Res, D-68159 Mannheim, Germany; [Barbera, Pablo] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Sch Int Relat, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA; [Fazekas, Zoltan] Univ Oslo, Dept Polit Sci, N-0317 Oslo, Norway; [Parnet, Olivier] Kantar Publ, B-1160 Brussels, Belgium",,"Theocharis, Y (corresponding author), Univ Mannheim, Mannheim Ctr European Social Res, D-68159 Mannheim, Germany.",yannis.theocharis@uni-mannheim.de,"Theocharis, Yannis/Q-8336-2019; Barberá, Pablo/G-1893-2016","Theocharis, Yannis/0000-0001-7209-9669; Barberá, Pablo/0000-0002-9063-4829",Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation; Alfred P.

Borrowing sophisticated tools and resources from computer science and computational linguistics, journalism scholars have started to gain insights into the constant information flow and made big data a regular feature of the scientific debate. Both deductive (manual and semi-automated) and inductive (fully automated) text analysis methods are part of this new toolset. In order to make the automated research process more tangible and provide an insight into the options available, we provide a roadmap of common (semi-) automated options for text analysis. We describe the assumptions and workflows of rule-based approaches, dictionaries, supervised machine learning, document clustering, and topic models. We show that automated methods have different strengths that provide different opportunities, enriching-but not replacing-the range of manual content analysis methods.","[Guenther, Elisabeth; Quandt, Thorsten] Univ Munster, Dept Commun, Munster, Germany",,"Gunther, E (corresponding author), Univ Munster, Dept Commun, Munster, Germany.",elisabeth.guenther@uni-muenster.de,"Quandt, Thorsten/ABE-4668-2021","Quandt, Thorsten/0000-0003-1937-0282",,,,,33,37,37,2,27,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

This study provides an exhaustive comparison of sentiment analysis methods, using a validation set of Dutch economic headlines to compare the performance of manual annotation, crowd coding, numerous dictionaries and machine learning using both traditional and deep learning algorithms. The three main conclusions of this article are that: (1) The best performance is still attained with trained human or crowd coding; (2) None of the used dictionaries come close to acceptable levels of validity; and (3) machine learning, especially deep learning, substantially outperforms dictionary-based methods but falls short of human performance. From these findings, we stress the importance of always validating automatic text analysis methods before usage. Moreover, we provide a recommended step-by-step approach for (automated) text analysis projects to ensure both efficiency and validity.","[van Atteveldt, Wouter; van der Velden, Mariken A. C.

Moving forward, we used a custom-built browser plug-in-passively tracking Dutch online news consumers 24/7-to examine how context (website) and content (news topic) features affect patterns of online news consumption. This resulted in a data set containing more than one million Web pages, from 175 websites (news websites, search engines, social media), collected over 8 months in 2017/18. We used automated content analysis to retrieve news topics, and estimated Markov chains to detect consumption patterns. Our findings indicate that news consumers often directly visit their favorite (typically mainstream) news outlet, and continue browsing within that outlet. We also found a strong preference for entertainment news over any other topic.

The rhetoric that political elites employ structures civic discourse. The emergence of social media platforms as a medium of politics has enabled ordinary citizens to express their ideological inclinations by adopting the lexicon of political elites. This avails to researchers a rich new source of data in the study of political ideology. However, existing ideological text-scaling methods fail to produce meaningful inferences when applied to the short, informal style of textual content that is characteristic of social media platforms such as Twitter. This paper introduces the first viable approach to the estimation of individual-level ideological positions derived from social media content. This method allows us to position social media users-be they political elites, parties, or citizens-along a shared ideological dimension. We validate the proposed method by demonstrating correlation with existing measures of ideology across various political contexts and multiple languages. We further demonstrate the ability of ideological estimates to capture derivative signal by predicting out-of-sample, individual-level voting intentions. We posit that social media data can, when properly modeled, better capture derivative signal than discrete scales used in more traditional survey instruments.","[Temporao, Mickael; Dufresne, Yannick] Univ Laval, Dept Sci Polit, Laval, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada; [Vande Kerckhove, Corentin; Hendrickx, Julien M.] Catholic Univ Louvain, Large Graphs & Networks Grp, Louvain La Neuve, Belgium; [van der Linden, Clifton] Univ Toronto, Dept Polit Sci, Toronto, ON M5S 3G3, Canada",,"Temporao, M (corresponding author), Univ Laval, Dept Sci Polit, Laval, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada.",mickael.temporao.1@ulaval.ca,"Hendrickx, Julien/AFL-9332-2022","van der Linden, Clifton/0000-0001-5649-2970; Temporao, Mickael/0000-0003-4689-2852","Canada Foundation for Innovation (CFI); ministere de l'Economie, de la science et de l'innovation du Quebec (MESI); Fonds de recherche du Quebec-Nature et technologies (FRQ-NT)","Canada Foundation for Innovation (CFI)(Canada Foundation for Innovation); ministere de l'Economie, de la science et de l'innovation du Quebec (MESI); Fonds de recherche du Quebec-Nature et technologies (FRQ-NT)","We thank Francois Gelineau, Thierry Giasson, William Jacoby, Jonathan N.

We argue that rational and emotional styles of communication ebb and flow within public discussions about social problems due to the alternating influence of social contagion and saturation effects. These cognitive-emotional currents create an opportunity structure whereby advocacy organizations stimulate more conversation if they produce emotional messages after prolonged rational debate or vice versa. We test this hypothesis using automated text-analysis techniques that measure the frequency of cognitive and emotional language within two advocacy fields on Facebook over 1.5 years, and a web-based application that offered these organizations a complimentary audit of their social media outreach in return for sharing nonpublic data about themselves, their social media audiences, and the broader social context in which they interact. Time-series models reveal strong support for our hypothesis, controlling for 33 confounding factors measured by our Facebook application. We conclude by discussing the implications of our findings for future research on public deliberation, how social contagions relate to each other, and the emerging field of computational social science.","[Bail, Christopher A.] Duke Univ, Sociol & Publ Policy, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Brown, Taylor W.; Mann, Marcus] Duke Univ, Sociol, Durham, NC 27708 USA",,"Bail, CA (corresponding author), Duke Univ, 254 Soc Psych Bldg, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",christopher.bail@duke.edu,,,National Science Foundation [1357223]; Robert Wood Johnson Foundation; Amazon,National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Robert Wood Johnson Foundation(Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF)); Amazon,"This research was made possible by the National Science Foundation (Grant # 1357223), The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, and Amazon.",,139,30,30,5,64,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0003-1224,1939-8271,,AM SOCIOL REV,Am.

Using the question of which news article characteristics predict news engagement on social media, this illustration of the multiverse approach shows how different measurement, data processing, and modelling choices lead to divergent conclusions. In particular, we show how the selection of widely used automated text analysis tools and preprocessing steps influence the conclusions drawn from the analysis. We also use this illustration to guide interested scholars through the different steps of doing a multiverse analysis. More broadly, we demonstrate how multiverse analysis can be an open and transparent research approach in a field that is increasingly faced with a wide range of analytical choices.","[Pipal, Christian] Univ Amsterdam, Dept Polit Sci, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Song, Hyunjin] Yonsei Univ, Dept Commun, Seoul, South Korea; [Boomgaarden, Hajo G.] Univ Vienna, Dept Commun, Vienna, Austria",,"Pipal, C (corresponding author), Univ Amsterdam, Dept Polit Sci, Amsterdam, Netherlands.",c.pipal@uva.nl,"Pipal, Christian/ABY-0629-2022","Boomgaarden, Hajo G./0000-0002-5260-1284; Pipal, Christian/0000-0002-5395-2035",European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme [759079],European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme(European Research Council (ERC)),"unding Christian Pipal received funding from the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No 759079, POLEMIC.",,66,0,0,7,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

However, although researchers routinely and conveniently resort to certain forms of human coding to validate the results derived from automated procedures, in practice the actual quality assurance of such a gold standard often goes unchecked. Contemporary practices of validation via manual annotations are far from being acknowledged as best practices in the literature, and the reporting and interpretation of validation procedures differ greatly. We systematically assess the connection between the quality of human judgment in manual annotations and the relative performance evaluations of automated procedures against true standards by relying on large-scale Monte Carlo simulations. The results from the simulations con?rm that there is a substantially greater risk of a researcher reaching an incorrect conclusion regarding the performance of automated procedures when the quality of manual annotations used for validation is not properly ensured. Our contribution should therefore be regarded as a call for the systematic application of high-quality manual validation materials in any political communication study, drawing on automated text analysis procedures.","[Song, Hyunjin; Eberl, Jakob-Moritz; Eisele, Olga; Heidenreich, Tobias; Lind, Fabienne; Galyga, Sebastian] Univ Vienna, Dept Commun, Vienna, Austria; [Boomgaarden, Hajo G.] Univ Vienna, Dept Commun, Empir Social Sci Methods Focus Text Anal, Vienna, Turkey; [Tolochko, Petro] Univ Vienna, Dept Polit Sci, Vienna, Austria; [Greussing, Esther] Tech Univ Carolo Wilhelmina Braunschweig, Dept Commun & Media Sci, Braunschweig, Germany",,"Song, H (corresponding author), Univ Vienna, Dept Commun, Vienna, Austria.",hyunjin.song@univie.ac.at,"Song, Hyunjin/ABD-2100-2020; Eberl, Jakob-Moritz/K-4689-2019; Galyga, Sebastian/AAS-4407-2021","Song, Hyunjin/0000-0001-7752-3035; Eberl, Jakob-Moritz/0000-0002-5613-760X; Galyga, Sebastian/0000-0003-2642-0815; , Fabienne/0000-0002-4978-9415; Tolochko, Petro/0000-0001-5971-8816; Heidenreich, Tobias/0000-0001-9070-0550; Boomgaarden, Hajo G./0000-0002-5260-1284; Eisele, Olga/0000-0002-6604-3498",Austrian Science Fund under the Hertha-Firnberg-Program [T-989],Austrian Science Fund under the Hertha-Firnberg-Program,Olga Eisele is supported by the Austrian Science Fund under the Hertha-Firnberg-Program [Grant no: T-989].,,39,12,12,2,8,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1058-4609,1091-7675,,POLIT COMMUN,Polit.

Although the issue has received some scholarly attention, there is a need to improve the conceptual precision in the increasingly blurry debate. The use of computational communication science approaches allows us to track political conversations in a fine-grained manner within their natural settings - the realm of interactive social media. The present study combines different algorithmic approaches to studying social media data in order to capture both the interactional structure and content of dynamic political talk online. We conducted an analysis of political polarization across social media platforms (analyzing Facebook, Twitter, and WhatsApp) over 16 months, with close to a quarter million online contributions regarding a political controversy in Israel. Our comprehensive measurement of interactive political talk enables us to address three key aspects of political polarization: (1) interactional polarization - homophilic versus heterophilic user interactions; (2) positional polarization - the positions expressed, and (3) affective polarization - the emotions and attitudes expressed. Our findings indicate that political polarization on social media cannot be conceptualized as a unified phenomenon, as there are significant cross-platform differences. While interactions on Twitter largely conform to established expectations (homophilic interaction patterns, aggravating positional polarization, pronounced inter-group hostility), on WhatsApp, de-polarization occurred over time. Surprisingly, Facebook was found to be the least homophilic platform in terms of interactions, positions, and emotions expressed.

Simple classifiers often serve well in these tasks. However, if words occurring early in a document alter the meaning of words occurring later in the document, using a more complicated model that can incorporate these time-dependent relationships can increase classification accuracy. Long short-term memory (LSTM) models are a type of neural network model designed to work with data that contains time dependencies. We investigate the conditions under which these models are useful for political science text classification tasks with applications to Chinese social media posts as well as US newspaper articles.

We answer this question by linking original survey data collected during the U.S. 2016 election campaign with respondents' observed social media activity. We use supervised machine learning to classify whether these Twitter and Facebook account data are content related to politics. We then benchmark our survey measures on frequency of posting about politics and the number of political figures followed. We find that, on average, our self-reported survey measures tend to correlate with observed social media activity. At the same time, we also find a worrying amount of individual-level discrepancy and problems related to extreme outliers. Our recommendations are twofold. The first is for survey questions about social media use to provide respondents with options covering a wider range of activity, especially in the long tail. The second is for survey questions to include specific content and anchors defining what it means for a post to be about politics.","[Guess, Andrew] Princeton Univ, Polit & Publ Affairs, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Munger, Kevin] Princeton Univ, Ctr Study Democrat Polit, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Nagler, Jonathan; Tucker, Joshua] NYU, Polit, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Nagler, Jonathan; Tucker, Joshua] NYU, Social Media & Polit Participat SMaPP Lab, New York, NY 10003 USA",,"Guess, A (corresponding author), Princeton Univ, Dept Polit, 213 Fisher Hall, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",aguess@princeton.edu,"Guess, Andrew/J-4904-2019","Guess, Andrew/0000-0003-2974-7848",INSPIRE program of the National Science Foundation [SES-1248077],INSPIRE program of the National Science Foundation,"This study has been approved by the New York University Institutional Review Board (IRB-12-9058, IRB-FY2017-150).

Reliability was established when two different metrics of inter-coder reliability could not distinguish whether a human or a machine coded the text on a separate hold-out set. Finally, in Step 3 we assessed validity. To accomplish this, we administered a survey in which participants described their own relational uncertainty/certainty via text and completed a questionnaire. After classifying the text, the machine's classifications of the participants' text positively correlated with the subjects' own self-reported relational uncertainty and relational satisfaction.

This reflects a growing worldwide trend in the use of physical repression to censor online speech. In this paper, we systematically examine the consequences of imprisoning well-known Saudis for online dissent by analyzing over 300 million tweets as well as detailed Google search data from 2010 to 2017 using automated text analysis and crowd-sourced human evaluation of content. We find that repression deterred imprisoned Saudis from continuing to dissent online. However, it did not suppress dissent overall. Twitter followers of the imprisoned Saudis engaged in more online dissent, including criticizing the ruling family and calling for regime change. Repression drew public attention to arrested Saudis and their causes, and other prominent figures in Saudi Arabia were not deterred by the repression of their peers and continued to dissent online.","[Pan, Jennifer] Stanford Univ, Dept Commun, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Siegel, Alexandra A.] Stanford Univ, Immigrat Policy Lab, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",,"Pan, J (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Dept Commun, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",jp1@stanford.edu; aasiegel@stanford.edu,"Siegel, Alexandra A./M-1331-2019","Siegel, Alexandra A./0000-0003-0792-7813; Pan, Jennifer/0000-0002-4818-0122",Stanford King Center on Global Poverty and Development; National Science Foundation [1647450],Stanford King Center on Global Poverty and Development; National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"Our thanks to Charles Crabtree, Killian Clarke, Christian Davenport, Martin Dimitrov, Jennifer Earl, Will Hobbs, Holger Kern, Beatriz Magaloni, Elizabeth Nugent, Molly Roberts, Arturas Rozenas, Anton Sobolev, Rory Truex, Lauren Young, Zachary SteinertThrelkeld, and participants at the 2018 APSA pre-conference on politics and computational social science for their helpful comments and suggestions; to SMaPP Global for making our collaboration possible; to the Stanford King Center on Global Poverty and Development and the National Science Foundation (Award #1647450) for research support.

We show that two reasonable approaches to corpus selection yield radically different corpora and we advocate for the use of keyword searches rather than predefined subject categories provided by news archives. We demonstrate the benefits of coding using article segments instead of sentences as units of analysis. We show that, given a fixed number of codings, it is better to increase the number of unique documents coded rather than the number of coders for each document.

By applying RF classifier models to Twitter data sets relevant to four news events and a randomly pooled dataset, the study finds systematic differences between general user samples and institutional user samples in their messaging patterns.

Digital platforms have reduced the gatekeeping power of traditional media and, potentially, they have increased the capacity of various kinds of actors to shape the agenda. We study this question in the Swiss context by examining the connections between three agendas: the traditional media agenda, the social media agenda of parties, and the social media agenda of politicians. Specifically, we validate and apply supervised machine learning classifiers to categorize 2.78 million articles published in 84 newspapers, 6,500 tweets posted on official party accounts, and 210,000 tweets posted by politicians on their own accounts from January 2018 until December 2019. We first use the classifier to measure the salience of the four most relevant issues of the period: the environment, Europe, gender equality, and immigration. Then, using a vector autoregression (VAR) approach, we analyze the relationship between the three agendas. Results show that not only do the traditional media agenda, the social media agenda of parties, and the social media agenda of politicians influence one another but, overall, no agenda leads the others more than it is led by them. There is one important exception: for the environment issue, the social media agenda of parties is more predictive of the traditional media agenda than vice-versa. These findings underscore how closely different agendas are tied together, but also show that advocacy campaigns may play an important role in both constraining and enabling parties to push their specific agendas.","[Gilardi, Fabrizio; Gessler, Theresa; Kubli, Mael] Univ Zurich, Dept Polit Sci, Affolternstr 56, CH-8050 Zurich, Switzerland; [Muller, Stefan] Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Polit & Int Relat, Dublin, Ireland",,"Gilardi, F (corresponding author), Univ Zurich, Dept Polit Sci, Affolternstr 56, CH-8050 Zurich, Switzerland.",gilardi@ipz.uzh.ch,"Gilardi, Fabrizio/AGF-1855-2022; Gessler, Theresa/AAB-5676-2019","Gessler, Theresa/0000-0003-2339-6266; Muller, Stefan/0000-0002-6315-4125; Gilardi, Fabrizio/0000-0002-0635-3048; Kubli, Mael/0000-0002-5592-9648",Swiss National Science Foundation [10DL11_183120]; European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union [883121],Swiss National Science Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)European Commission); European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union(European Research Council (ERC)),This project received funding from the Swiss National Science Foundation (grant nr. 10DL11_183120) and the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program (grant agreement nr. 883121),,71,12,12,36,77,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1058-4609,1091-7675,,POLIT COMMUN,Polit.

The results suggest that computer software can be used successfully to identify trending news stories, allow journalists to search within a social media corpus, and help verify social media contributors and content. However, such software also raises questions about accountability as social media is algorithmically filtered for use by journalists and others. Our analysis of the inputs SocialSensor relies on shows biases towards those who are vocal and have an audience, many of whom are men in the media. We also reveal some of the technology's temporal and topic preferences. The conclusion discusses whether such biases are necessary for systems like SocialSensor to be effective.

Although all substantive results depend on this choice, researchers usually pick keywords in ad hoc ways that are far from optimal and usually biased. Most seem to think that keyword selection is easy, since they do Google searches every day, but we demonstrate that humans perform exceedingly poorly at this basic task. We offer a better approach, one that also can help with following conversations where participants rapidly innovate language to evade authorities, seek political advantage, or express creativity; generic web searching; eDiscovery; look-alike modeling; industry and intelligence analysis; and sentiment and topic analysis. We develop a computer-assisted (as opposed to fully automated or human-only) statistical approach that suggests keywords from available text without needing structured data as inputs. This framing poses the statistical problem in a new way, which leads to a widely applicable algorithm. Our specific approach is based on training classifiers, extracting information from (rather than correcting) their mistakes, and summarizing results with easy-to-understand Boolean search strings. We illustrate how the technique works with analyses of English texts about the Boston Marathon bombings, Chinese social media posts designed to evade censorship, and others.","[King, Gary] Harvard Univ, Inst Quantitat Social Sci, 1737 Cambridge St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Lam, Patrick] Thresher, Dudley, England; [Roberts, Margaret E.] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Polit Sci, Social Sci Bldg 301,9500 Gilman Dr,0521, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA",,"King, G (corresponding author), Harvard Univ, Inst Quantitat Social Sci, 1737 Cambridge St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",King@Harvard.edu; patrick@thresher.io; meroberts@ucsd.edu,,,,,,,35,35,35,1,25,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0092-5853,1540-5907,,AM J POLIT SCI,Am.

With an eye toward capturing the accuracy of media coverage on public policy, we apply both hierarchical dictionary counts and supervised learning to measure mass media coverage of change in US defense spending. Both approaches appear to do well at capturing a media policy signal in the area, which provides an important test of convergent validity. While the results highlight the value of both dictionary and machine learning methods used independently, they also illustrate ways in which the two can be used in combination.","[Dun, Lindsay; Wlezien, Christopher] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Govt, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Soroka, Stuart] Univ Michigan, Dept Commun & Media, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",,"Wlezien, C (corresponding author), Univ Texas Austin, Dept Govt, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",Wlezien@austin.utexas.edu,"Soroka, Stuart/N-6501-2019","Wlezien, Christopher/0000-0002-0719-697X; Soroka, Stuart/0000-0001-7524-0859; Dun, Lindsay/0000-0002-2982-5386",,,,,37,1,1,2,10,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1058-4609,1091-7675,,POLIT COMMUN,Polit.

Based on open-ended responses from a representative survey conducted during the election campaign, we train a human-interpretable Bayesian language model to identify political topics. Applying the model to social media messages of candidates and their direct audiences, we find that both prioritize different topics than the mass audience. The analysis also shows that politicians use Facebook and Twitter for different purposes.

While machine learning approaches usually perform better, they offer little insight into (a) which of the assumptions underlying dictionary approaches (bag-of-words, domain transferability, or additivity) impedes performance most, and (b) which language features drive the algorithmic classification most strongly. To fill both gaps, we offer a systematic assumption-based error analysis, using the integrative complexity of social media comments as our case in point. We show that attacking the additivity assumption offers the strongest potential for improving dictionary performance. We also propose to combine off-the-shelf dictionaries with supervised glass box machine learning algorithms (as opposed to the usual black box machine learning approaches) to classify texts and learn about the most important features for classification. This dictionary-plus-supervised-learning approach performs similarly well as classic full-text machine learning or deep learning approaches, but yields interpretable results in addition, which can inform theory development on top of enabling a valid classification.","[Dobbrick, Timo; Jakob, Julia; Chan, Chung-Hong] Univ Mannheim, Mannheim Ctr European Social Res, Mannheim, Germany; [Wessler, Hartmut] Univ Mannheim, Inst Media & Commun Studies, Mannheim, Germany",,"Dobbrick, T (corresponding author), Mannheimer Zentrum Europaische Sozialforsch MZES, A 5,6,A Raum 215, D-68159 Mannheim, Germany.",Timo.Dobbrick@mzes.uni-mannheim.de,"; Chan, Chung-hong/D-6946-2013","Wessler, Hartmut/0000-0003-4216-5471; Dobbrick, Timo/0000-0002-6252-1157; Chan, Chung-hong/0000-0002-6232-7530; Jakob, Julia/0000-0003-2340-5193",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [260291564],Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft(German Research Foundation (DFG)),This work was supported by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [260291564].,,49,1,1,1,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1931-2458,1931-2466,,COMMUN METHODS MEAS,Commun.

We conducted a series of open-ended, in-depth qualitative interviews with campaign professionals active during the 2016 presidential cycle. Our analysis revealed that scholars need to account for the ways that campaigns perceive their candidates in addition to the audiences, affordances, and genres of different social media platforms, as well as the timing of the electoral cycle, in order to effectively study strategic social media communication. Our findings reveal that campaigns proceed from perceptions of their candidates' public personae and comfort with engagement on social media. Campaigns perceive that social media platforms vary according to their audiences, including their demographics and other characteristics; with respect to their affordances, actual and perceived functionalities; the genres of communication perceived to be appropriate to them; and the timing of the electoral cycle, which shapes messaging strategies and the utility of particular platforms. These factors shape how campaigns use social media in the service of their electoral goals. We conclude by developing these findings into an analytic framework for future research, arguing that researchers should refrain from automatically generalizing the results of single-platform studies to social media as a whole, and detailing the implications of our findings for future political communication research.","[Kreiss, Daniel] Univ N Carolina, Sch Media & Journalism, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Lawrence, Regina G.] Univ Oregon, George S Turnbull Ctr, Eugene, OR 97403 USA; [Lawrence, Regina G.] Univ Oregon, Agora Journalism Ctr, Eugene, OR 97403 USA; [Lawrence, Regina G.] Univ Oregon, Sch Journalism & Commun, Eugene, OR 97403 USA; [McGregor, Shannon C.] Univ Utah, Dept Commun, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA",,"Kreiss, D (corresponding author), Univ N Carolina, Sch Media & Journalism, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA.",,"McGregor, Shannon C/AAO-1718-2020","McGregor, Shannon/0000-0002-3275-0397",Social Media Collective at Microsoft Research,Social Media Collective at Microsoft Research(Microsoft),"The authors wish to thank editor Claes deVreese and guest editors Leticia Bode and Emily Vraga for their guidance on this study, as well as for attending our 8am APSA presentation and suggesting we submit to the special issue.

Based on media logic theory, we argue that the communication style of these messages is likely to be more interpersonal and subjective. To investigate this we used computational text analysis to compare status messages to headlines and leads, covering nine newspapers from the Netherlands and Flanders over a period of 2.5 years. We conclude that newspapers use status messages to add a subjective expression to news on social media, and call for research into how this takes shape and affects the audience.","[Welbers, Kasper] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Commun Sci, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Opgenhaffen, Michael] Univ Leuven, Inst Media Studies, Leuven, Belgium",,"Welbers, K (corresponding author), Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Commun Sci, Amsterdam, Netherlands.",k.welbers@vu.nl; michael.opgenhaffen@kuleuven.be,"Welbers, Kasper/D-2785-2016","Welbers, Kasper/0000-0003-2929-3815",,,,,52,27,27,2,22,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

This paper examines discourses around mobilization vs. demobilization in the context of the municipal elections in Jerusalem. As the sweeping majority of East Jerusalem Palestinians have continuously been boycotting Jerusalem's municipal elections, this is a potent case through which to examine how demobilization functions in action, through social media conversations. Using a mixed-methods analysis of Twitter contents as structured by different languages, our findings show how mobilization and demobilization discourses can co-occur during the same election event. Users of different languages - reflecting different social and political identities - interpret the elections in contrasting ways, with tangible implications for (in)equality in political participation. The study thus contributes theoretically to several domains of political communication, including election studies, local politics, and language fragmentation in online political discourse.","[Kligler-Vilenchik, Neta; de Vries Kedem, Maya] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Commun & Journalism, IL-91905 Jerusalem, Israel; [Maier, Daniel] Free Univ Berlin, Inst Media & Commun Studies, Berlin, Germany; [Stoltenberg, Daniela] Univ Munster, Munster, Germany",,"Kligler-Vilenchik, N (corresponding author), Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Commun & Journalism, IL-91905 Jerusalem, Israel.",neta.kv@mail.huji.ac.il,,"Kligler-Vilenchik, Neta/0000-0003-3470-3305; Stoltenberg, Daniela/0000-0001-9334-1514",,,,,38,2,3,1,16,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1058-4609,1091-7675,,POLIT COMMUN,Polit.

First, we develop a model to estimate the ideology of politicians and their supporters using social media data on individual citizens' endorsements of political figures. Our measure allows us to place politicians and more than 6 million citizens who are active in social media on the same metric. We validate the ideological estimates that result from the scaling process by showing they correlate highly with existing measures of ideology from Congress, and with individual-level self-reported political views. Finally, we use these measures to study the relationship between ideology and age, social relationships and ideology, and the relationship between friend ideology and turnout.","[Bond, Robert] Ohio State Univ, Sch Commun, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Messing, Solomon] Facebook Data Sci, Menlo Pk, CA 94025 USA",,"Bond, R (corresponding author), Ohio State Univ, Sch Commun, 3072 Derby Hall 154 North Oval Mall, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.",bond.136@osu.edu; solomon@fb.com,"Bond, Robert Meade/A-1561-2014",,,,,,73,72,73,1,61,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0003-0554,1537-5943,,AM POLIT SCI REV,Am.

By interaction, we refer to the attention participants gave to news (measured through the time devoted to looking at the content); how they read these news items (measured through ocular movements on the screen); and the way they engaged with this content (measured through forms of participation such as liking, commenting, or sharing news). The data were triangulated through interviews with Facebook users and an analysis of the metrics of posts from Costa Rican news organizations on Facebook from 2017 to 2020. We draw on scholarship in communication studies and multimodal discourse analysis. We argue for a more nuanced approach to what study participants did when they incidentally encountered news on social media that focuses on mechanisms, that is, the specific procedures and operations that shape user interaction with news on Facebook (such as visual fixations on parts of news posts; the visual entry points through which they begin to interact with the news; the sequences that characterize how they navigate content; and the time they spend assessing various multimodal elements).","[Vergara, Adrian; Castro, Ana Claudia] Univ Costa Rica, Sch Philol Linguist & Literature, San Jose, Costa Rica; [Siles, Ignacio; Chaves, Alonso] Univ Costa Rica, Sch Commun, San Jose, Costa Rica",,"Siles, I (corresponding author), Univ Costa Rica, Sch Commun, San Jose, Costa Rica.",ignacio.siles@ucr.ac.cr,"Siles, Ignacio/ABF-6087-2020","Siles, Ignacio/0000-0002-9725-8694",Universidad de Costa Rica's Espacio de Estudios Avanzados (UCREA),Universidad de Costa Rica's Espacio de Estudios Avanzados (UCREA),This work was supported by Universidad de Costa Rica's Espacio de Estudios Avanzados (UCREA).,,49,3,3,5,22,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

Building on a simple formal theoretical model of two-candidate elections informed by the ideational approach to populist communication, we argue that the initially less popular political actors are more likely to use populist rhetoric in a gamble to have at least some chance of winning. To test the empirical implications of our argument, we construct the most comprehensive corpus of U.S. presidential campaign speeches (1952-2016) and estimate the prevalence of populist rhetoric across these speeches with a novel automated text analysis method utilizing active learning and word embedding. Overall, we show the robustly greater use of populism among the presidential candidates with the lower polling numbers regardless of their partisanship or incumbency status.","[Dai, Yaoyao; Kustov, Alexander] Univ N Carolina, Dept Polit Sci & Publ Adm, 9201 Univ City Blvd, Charlotte, NC 28223 USA",,"Dai, YY (corresponding author), Univ N Carolina, Dept Polit Sci & Publ Adm, 9201 Univ City Blvd, Charlotte, NC 28223 USA.",yaoyao.dai@uncc.edu,"Dai, Yaoyao/ADJ-9675-2022","Dai, Yaoyao/0000-0003-3035-331X; Kustov, Alexander/0000-0001-9361-8739",,,,,80,1,1,10,10,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1058-4609,1091-7675,,POLIT COMMUN,Polit.

The study builds on an extensive data collection of all Scandinavian news outlets' Facebook posts including their respective websites' article teasers over the course of 11 months. We investigate the use of news text grammar (e.g., punctuation or the use of pronouns) and social media features (e.g., hashtags or the use of emojis) alongside structural influences from individual countries, outlet reach, and ownership. Findings show Facebook posts to include less punctuation while employing more calls to action through the use of question and exclamation marks.

Unfortunately, conversations on social media are often toxic and not conducive to healthy political discussions. Twitter, the most widely used social network for political discussions, doubled the limit of characters in a tweet in November 2017, which provided an opportunity to study the effect of technological affordances on political discussions using a discontinuous time series design. Using supervised and unsupervised natural language processing methods, we analyzed 358,242 tweet replies to U.S. politicians from January 2017 to March 2018. We show that doubling the permissible length of a tweet led to less uncivil, more polite, and more constructive discussions online. However, the declining trend in the empathy and respectfulness of these tweets raises concerns about the implications of the changing norms for the quality of political deliberation.","[Jaidka, Kokil] Nanyang Technol Univ, Wee Kim Wee Sch Commun & Informat, Singapore 637718, Singapore; [Zhou, Alvin; Lelkes, Yphtach] Univ Penn, Annenberg Sch Commun, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",,"Lelkes, Y (corresponding author), Univ Penn, Annenberg Sch Commun, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",ylelkes@upenn.edu,"Jaidka, Kokil/AAK-2618-2020","Jaidka, Kokil/0000-0002-8127-1157",,,,,97,24,24,10,63,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0021-9916,1460-2466,,J COMMUN,J.

These revelations led to public outcry, mostly from conservatives upset at possible bias and journalists critical of Facebook for its largely secretive and haphazard approach to news. This study examines the response to the controversy as metajournalistic discourse-talk about news that seeks to define appropriate practices and legitimate news forms. It identifies a fundamental divergence in the public articulation of Facebook's role in the larger news ecosystem. Facebook reacted to the controversy by formulating an approach to news as a form of content that, like other content on the site, should be personalized, organized according to popularity in the form of user engagement, and free of editorial control from the social media site. By contrast, journalists positioned news as purposively selected and shared while placing Facebook as an active participant within the news ecosystem and therefore beholden to an enhanced institutional commitment to public responsibility.","[Carlson, Matt] St Louis Univ, Dept Commun, St Louis, MO 63103 USA",,"Carlson, M (corresponding author), St Louis Univ, Dept Commun, St Louis, MO 63103 USA.",mcarls10@slu.edu,,,,,,,38,55,56,8,53,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

A systematic analysis of Internet search data, social media postings, and newspaper articles allows us to identify how the documentary Gasland reshaped public discourse. We find that Gasland contributed not only to greater online searching about fracking, but also to increased social media chatter and heightened mass media coverage. Local screenings of Gasland contributed to anti-fracking mobilizations, which, in turn, affected the passage of local fracking moratoria in the Marcellus Shale states.

These developments have occurred in tandem with, and accelerated by, the emergence of digital and social media. Research on news production has shown that journalistic work has always taken emotion into consideration, shaping approaches to storytelling and presentation. However, the view of journalists as detached observers has rendered the emotional labor associated with news production invisible. Research on emotion in journalistic texts has highlighted the fact that even conventional hard news genres are shaped by an engagement with emotion. As studies on news audiences and emotions have shown, audiences are more likely to be emotionally engaged, recall information and take action when news stories are relatable. The affordances of digital platforms and social media have had a profound impact on the space for emotion. The expanded opportunities for participation have contributed to questioning traditional distinctions between news audiences and producers and have ushered in new and more forms of emotional expression that have spilled over into practices of news production.","[Wahl-Jorgensen, Karin] Cardiff Univ, Sch Journalism Media & Culture, Cardiff, S Glam, Wales",,"Wahl-Jorgensen, K (corresponding author), Cardiff Univ, Sch Journalism Media & Culture, Cardiff, S Glam, Wales.",wahl-jorgensenk@cardiff.ac.uk,,,,,,,111,77,77,37,73,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

The results showed that information utility-related message features increased the duration for which articles prompted email-based sharing, whereas emotional positivity and controversiality increased the longevity of social media-based sharing. Expressed emotional evocativeness and the absence of death-related words lengthened the duration for which articles prompted both email- and social media-based sharing. News retransmission, via either email or social media, was more likely to persist when the articles stayed on the most-emailed list for a longer time, showing social endorsement-driven cumulative advantage effects. The results further revealed synergistic interaction effects between social endorsements and message features. While social endorsements produced strong cumulative-advantage effects on the longevity of news sharing, articles with certain message features that are diagnostic of their inherent share-worthiness generated even stronger effects than those articles that appeared on the most-emailed list for the same amount of time but lacked such features. These features were expressed emotional evocativeness (email-based sharing), the absence of death-related words, and exemplification (social media-based sharing).","[Kim, Hyun Suk] Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Commun, Seoul, South Korea",,"Kim, HS (corresponding author), Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Commun, Seoul, South Korea.",hyunsuk.kim@snu.ac.kr,,,"National Cancer Institute at the National Institutes of Health [R01CA160226, 5U01CA154254]; Annenberg (Dissertation Research Fellowship); Wharton (Russell Ackoff Doctoral Student Fellowship) Schools at the University of Pennsylvania; research resettlement fund for new faculty [200-20180112]; Institute of Communication Research at Seoul National University; Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea; National Research Foundation of Korea [NRF-2018S1A5B8070398]",National Cancer Institute at the National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Cancer Institute (NCI)); Annenberg (Dissertation Research Fellowship); Wharton (Russell Ackoff Doctoral Student Fellowship) Schools at the University of Pennsylvania; research resettlement fund for new faculty; Institute of Communication Research at Seoul National University; Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea; National Research Foundation of Korea(National Research Foundation of Korea),"The author acknowledges the funding support of the National Cancer Institute at the National Institutes of Health (R01CA160226 and 5U01CA154254), the Annenberg (Dissertation Research Fellowship) and Wharton (Russell Ackoff Doctoral Student Fellowship) Schools at the University of Pennsylvania, the research resettlement fund for new faculty (200-20180112) and the Institute of Communication Research at Seoul National University, and the Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea and the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF-2018S1A5B8070398).

The internationalization of news consumption is intensified by social media like Twitter, as users share news from different countries. In our study, we combine the two strands of research about media repertoires as well as transnational news consumption. Switzerland is a compelling case with regard to transnational news consumption as media outlets in the three official languages, German, French, and Italian can reach audiences in the larger neighbouring countries of Germany, France, and Italy. To investigate transnational news consumption, we tracked URL shares of Swiss online news media websites for two months on Twitter. We then combined this data with the users' followee structures in the Twitter network (n = 355,197 tweets, n = 64,170 unique users) and inductively detected domestic and foreign audience communities with social network analysis. Thus, we were able to identify and compare the Twitter news media repertoires of domestic and foreign audience communities. Regarding transnational usage patterns, we show that especially quality media brands continuously reach audience communities in neighbouring countries.","[Rauchfleisch, Adrian] Natl Taiwan Univ, Grad Inst Journalism, Taipei, Taiwan; [Vogler, Daniel] Univ Zurich, Dept Commun & Media Res, Zurich, Switzerland; [Vogler, Daniel; Eisenegger, Mark] Univ Zurich, Res Ctr Publ Sphere & Soc, Zurich, Switzerland",,"Rauchfleisch, A (corresponding author), Natl Taiwan Univ, Grad Inst Journalism, Taipei, Taiwan.",adrian.rauchfleisch@gmail.com,"Rauchfleisch, Adrian/AAK-4164-2020","Vogler, Daniel/0000-0002-0211-7574; Eisenegger, Mark/0000-0002-4964-2528; RAUCHFLEISCH, ADRIAN/0000-0003-1232-083X",,,,,53,3,3,3,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

Results revealed that 2-sided CSR responses are more effective than 1-sided responses in enhancing altruistic motives for CSR, reducing perceived negativity in the public's comments, and eliciting favorable attitudes, especially when comments were negative. The effects of message sidedness disappeared when the public's comments were positive.

We use text analyses to characterize the frequency, toxicity, and tone of comments in the chat. Our experimental findings indicate that Democratic subjects assigned to the Facebook (social) chat condition reported lower affect toward Democrats and a worse viewing experience, aligned with the toxic and overwhelming nature of the chat. The polarity of candidate-directed comments also influenced candidate evaluations and perceived performance in the polls.

Considering the fundamental transformations of the media ecology brought about by digitization and the advent of social media, it has been assumed that journalists are more or less compelled to reinvent their professional role and identity. We know a good deal about how social media is adopted by journalists, mostly through survey and interview studies investigating self-perceptions of identity in terms of norms and values. There are also some case studies, predominantly in the form of (quantitative) content analyses, exploring the (innovative) uses of Twitter. However, we still have little knowledge about how the professional identity of journalists is discursively constructed-how, in specific detail, traditional norms and ideals are discursively reinforced or challenged-in the Twitter flow. With a discourse theoretical and methodological approach, this article aims to contribute to our understanding of the discursive construction of professional identity on Twitter by qualitatively analyzing tweets from the most widely followed journalist in Sweden. The analysis of the most active j-tweeter can yield important clues as to what journalism may be in the process of becoming. The article identifies discourses that (1) reinforce the watchdog identity, (2) challenge the watchdog identity, (3) reinforce the disseminator/explicator identity, and (4) reinforce transparency but challenge professional identity. It concludes that the reinvented journalistic identity includes discursive processes that both shape and are shaped by Twitter in a dialectical relationship.","[Olausson, Ulrika] Jonkoping Univ, Sch Educ & Commun, Jonkoping, Sweden",,"Olausson, U (corresponding author), Jonkoping Univ, Sch Educ & Commun, Jonkoping, Sweden.",ulrika.olausson@ju.se,,,Swedish Research Council,Swedish Research Council(Swedish Research CouncilEuropean Commission),This work was supported by The Swedish Research Council.,,49,30,30,2,31,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

This study addresses a gap in the literature on citizen-initiated peace communication in the context of interstate relations, conflict and public diplomacy, with a focus on the understudied case of media flows between India and Pakistan, two nuclear-armed nations embroiled in perpetual enmity since the 1947 Partition. Revolutions in ICTs led to a shift in the dominant media flow from top-down and statist to bottom-up, with horizontal media flows fostered by individuals and groups now on social media platforms that opened up space for civil discourse. Dozens of different online citizen groups promoting peace on Facebook, YouTube and other platforms lead to the conclusion that peace communication in cross-border media flows indeed may have the potential to result in peace dividends in the form of fostering civil communication in shared values, culture, and collective well-being.","[Kumar, Anup] Cleveland State Univ, Sch Commun, Cleveland, OH 44115 USA; [Semetko, Holli A.] Emory Univ, Polit Sci, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA",,"Semetko, HA (corresponding author), Emory Univ, Polit Sci, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA.",holli.semetko@emory.edu,,"Semetko, Holli/0000-0002-8383-7919",,,,,73,3,3,0,16,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0021-9916,1460-2466,,J COMMUN,J.

I argue that the leaders of patriarchal social movements face pragmatic incentives to expand women's authority roles when seeking new movement members. Women authorities help patriarchal movements by making persuasive, identity-based arguments in favor of patriarchy that men cannot, and by reaching new audiences that men cannot. I support this argument by examining the rise of online female preachers in the Islamist Salafi movement, using interviews, Twitter analysis, and automated text analysis of 21,000 texts by 172 men and 43 women on the Salafi-oriented website saaid.net. To show the theory's generality, I also apply it to the contemporary white nationalist movement in the United States. The findings illustrate how movements that aggressively enforce traditional gender roles for participants can nevertheless increase female authority for pragmatic political reasons.","[Nielsen, Richard A.] MIT, Dept Polit Sci, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",,"Nielsen, RA (corresponding author), MIT, Dept Polit Sci, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",rnielsen@mit.edu,,,Carnegie Corporation of New York,Carnegie Corporation of New York,"I appreciate comments on earlier versions from Amaney Jamal, Tarek Masoud, Marc Lynch, Mirjam Kunkler, Ana Weeks, Marsin Alshamary, Rebecca Nielsen, Bruce Rutherford, Zehra Arat, Henri Lauziere, Aaron Rock-Singer, Ari Schriber, and Malika Zhegal, and participants at the NYU Center for Data Science, the University of Connecticut, the Northeast Middle East Politics Working Group, the 2016 AALIMS conference, the 2016 MESA conference, and the Salafiyya Workshop held at Harvard in March 2016.

This article aims to extend the analysis to the public interactions between citizens and media on Twitter after the airplane accident of Germanwings' flight 9525, in which citizens' eyewitnessing role was minimized. Thematic and interpretative analysis have been carried out of 70,000 messages posted on Twitter with the hashtag #germanwings during the three days after the crash. Results point towards a hegemonic position of accounts connected to news media (mainstream, but also local and specialized outlets) in what regards public interactions in Twitter. However, findings also suggest that this central position coexists with an important role of the common citizen in shaping both the agenda of issues that are going to be covered but also the particular narratives and discourses associated to these issues. Furthermore, results also reflect how Twitter users were active in auditing the work of news media, criticising some of the approaches of their coverage that they considered to be negligent, unprofessional or unethical, performing as watchdogs of professional journalists and news media.","[Masip, Pere; Ruiz, Caries; Suau, Jaume] Univ Ramon Llull, Blanquerna Sch Commun & Int Relat, Barcelona, Spain",,"Masip, P (corresponding author), Univ Ramon Llull, Blanquerna Sch Commun & Int Relat, Barcelona, Spain.",peremm@blanquerna.url.edu,"Suau, Jaume/AAA-2575-2020","Suau, Jaume/0000-0003-4480-4441; Masip, Pere/0000-0002-8231-0824; Ruiz, Carlos/0000-0002-1395-2145",Ministerio de Ecomomia y Competitividad (Spain) [CSO2015-64955-C4-1-R],Ministerio de Ecomomia y Competitividad (Spain),This work was supported by the Ministerio de Ecomomia y Competitividad (Spain) under Grant CSO2015-64955-C4-1-R (MINECO/FEDER).,,67,7,7,5,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

We elaborate and illustrate this definition through a discussion of the co-evolving relationship of journalism with the Internet and social media platforms since the 2000s and outline in detail how social news outlets such as BuzzFeed are paradigmatic examples of these dynamics and relationships. The article concludes by emphasizing the urgent need for both the study and practice of digital journalism in the public interest, especially in the context of an increasingly platformed and closed media system.

Especially in the study of natural discourse on digital media, the interactive, ever-evolving stream of conversations across multiple platforms regularly defies efforts to obtain well-defined samples of manageable size, while their linguistic variability imposes major limitations upon the accuracy of automated tools. In this paper, we draw upon recent advances in computational text analysis to develop a hybrid approach to the deductive analysis of large-scale digital discourse, which combines the algorithmic extraction of coherent, recurrent patterns with a manual coding of identified patterns. The approach scales up to treat millions of texts at minimal added human effort, while affording researchers close control over the process of theory-guided classification. We demonstrate the power of Hybrid Content Analysis by studying polarization in a quarter of a million contributions from cross-platform interactive social media discourse about a controversial incident.","[Baden, Christian; Kligler-Vilenchik, Neta] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Commun & Journalism, IL-90105 Jerusalem, Israel; [Yarchi, Moran] Interdisciplinary Ctr Herzliya, Sch Commun, Herzliyya, Israel",,"Baden, C (corresponding author), Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Commun & Journalism, IL-90105 Jerusalem, Israel.",c.baden@mail.huji.ac.il,"Kligler-Vilenchik, Neta/J-3472-2019; Yarchi, Moran/H-6480-2015; Baden, Christian/U-9165-2019","Kligler-Vilenchik, Neta/0000-0003-3470-3305; Yarchi, Moran/0000-0002-8044-2145; Baden, Christian/0000-0002-3771-3413",,,,,55,5,5,3,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1931-2458,1931-2466,,COMMUN METHODS MEAS,Commun.

We combine a quantitative text analysis approach with supervised learning and limited human resources in order to classify the front-page articles of a leading Hungarian daily newspaper based on their full text. Our goal was to assign items in our dataset to one of 21 policy topics based on the codebook of the Comparative Agendas Project. The classification of the imbalanced classes of topics was handled by a hybrid binary snowball workflow. This relies on limited human resources as well as supervised learning; it simplifies the multiclass problem to one of binary choice; and it is based on a snowball approach as we augment the training set with machine-classified observations after each successful round and also between corpora. Our results show that our approach provided better precision results (of over 80% for most topic codes) than what is customary for human coders and most computer-assisted coding projects. Nevertheless, this high precision came at the expense of a relatively low, below 60%, share of labeled articles.","[Sebok, Miklos; Kacsuk, Zoltan] Hungarian Acad Sci, Ctr Social Sci, Budapest, Hungary; [Kacsuk, Zoltan] Hsch Medien, Stuttgart, Germany",,"Sebok, M (corresponding author), Hungarian Acad Sci, Ctr Social Sci, Budapest, Hungary.",sebok.miklos@tk.mta.hu,"Sebők, Miklós/AAG-4854-2019","Sebők, Miklós/0000-0003-0595-2951","National Research, Development and Innovation Office (NKFIH) [AJP-K-109303, FK-123907]; Bolyai Research Grant; Incubator and Flagship grants of ELKH TK","National Research, Development and Innovation Office (NKFIH)(National Research, Development & Innovation Office (NRDIO) - Hungary); Bolyai Research Grant(Hungarian Academy of Sciences); Incubator and Flagship grants of ELKH TK","This work was supported by the National Research, Development and Innovation Office (NKFIH) grant (AJP-K-109303, FK-123907); the Incubator and Flagship grants of ELKH TK, and the Bolyai Research Grant for Miklos Sebok.",,29,3,3,3,6,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1047-1987,1476-4989,,POLIT ANAL,Polit.

I analyze this new trend toward different sorts of political scientists using digital resources to study ideas, to outline underlying paradigms relating language and politics in these respective fields, and to consider how they could be brought into productive conversation. I then consider how such conversation would enrich subdisciplinary understandings of the role of language in politics.

However, the digitization of newspaper archives now allows for innovative digital methods for systematic longitudinal research beyond the scope of incidental case studies. We argue that supervised machine learning offers promising approaches to analyse abundant source material, ground analyses in big data, and map the structural transformation of journalistic discourse longitudinally. By automatically analysing form and style conventions, that reflect underlying professional norms and practices, the structure of news coverage can be studied more closely. However, automatically classifying latent and period-specific coding categories is highly complex. The structure of digital newspaper archives (e.g. segmentation, OCR) complicates this even more, while machine learning algorithms are often a black box. This paper shows how making classification processes transparent enables journalism scholars to employ these computational methods in a reliable and valid way. We illustrate this by focusing on the issues we encountered with automatically classifying news genres, an illuminating but particularly complex coding category. Ultimately, such an approach could foster a revision of journalism history, particularly the often hypothesized but understudied shift from opinion-based to fact-centred reporting.","[Broersma, Marcel; Harbers, Frank] Univ Groningen, Ctr Media & Journalism Studies, Groningen, Netherlands",,"Broersma, M (corresponding author), Univ Groningen, Ctr Media & Journalism Studies, Groningen, Netherlands.",m.j.broersma@rug.nl; f.harbers@rug.nl,,"Harbers, Frank/0000-0003-1578-7582; Broersma, Marcel/0000-0002-7342-3472",Netherlands e-Science Center [ADAH.2016.020]; CLARIAH/NWO,Netherlands e-Science Center; CLARIAH/NWO,This work was supported by CLARIAH/NWO and the Netherlands e-Science Center [Grant number: ADAH.2016.020].,,45,2,2,8,30,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

Yet, research on the psychological motivations behind the spread of political fake news on social media is surprisingly limited. Are citizens who share fake news ignorant and lazy? Are they fueled by sinister motives, seeking to disrupt the social status quo? Or do they seek to attack partisan opponents in an increasingly polarized political environment? This article is the first to test these competing hypotheses based on a careful mapping of psychological profiles of over 2,300 American Twitter users linked to behavioral sharing data and sentiment analyses of more than 500,000 news story headlines. The findings contradict the ignorance perspective but provide some support for the disruption perspective and strong support for the partisan polarization perspective. Thus, individuals who report hating their political opponents are the most likely to share political fake news and selectively share content that is useful for derogating these opponents. Overall, our findings show that fake news sharing is fueled by the same psychological motivations that drive other forms of partisan behavior, including sharing partisan news from traditional and credible news sources.","[Osmundsen, Mathias; Bor, Alexander; Petersen, Michael Bang] Aarhus Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Aarhus, Denmark; [Vahlstrup, Peter Bjerregaard] Aarhus Univ, Sch Commun & Culture Informat Sci, Aarhus, Denmark; [Bechmann, Anja] Aarhus Univ, DATALAB, Sch Commun & Culture, Aarhus, Denmark",,"Osmundsen, M (corresponding author), Aarhus Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Aarhus, Denmark.",m.osmundsen@ps.au.dk; alexander.bor@ps.au.dk; imvpbv@cc.au.dk; anjabechmann@cc.au.dk; michael@ps.au.dk,"Bor, Alexander/AAE-9421-2020","Bor, Alexander/0000-0002-2624-9221; Petersen, Michael Bang/0000-0002-6782-5635; Osmundsen, Mathias/0000-0002-6234-5624; Bechmann, Anja/0000-0002-5588-5155",Aarhus University Research Foundation [AUFF-E-2016-9-22]; Carlsberg Foundation [CF18-1108],Aarhus University Research Foundation; Carlsberg Foundation(Carlsberg Foundation),This study was funded by grant AUFF-E-2016-9-22 from the Aarhus University Research Foundation to Michael Bang Petersen and grant CF18-1108 from the Carlsberg Foundation to Michael Bang Petersen.,,51,30,30,12,19,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0003-0554,1537-5943,,AM POLIT SCI REV,Am.

Political scientists have offered a variety of conceptual frameworks, but have neglected to explore how ordinary citizens understand terrorism, despite the central role the public plays in our understanding of the relationship between terrorism and government action in the wake of violence. We synthesize components of both scholarly definitions and public debates to formulate predictions for how various attributes of incidents affect the likelihood they are perceived as terrorism. Combining a conjoint experiment with machine learning techniques and automated content analysis of media coverage, we show the importance not only of the type and severity of violence, but also the attributed motivation for the incident and social categorization of the actor. The findings demonstrate how the language used to describe violent incidents, for which the media has considerable latitude, affects the likelihood the public classifies incidents as terrorism.","[Huff, Connor] Harvard Univ, Dept Govt, 1737 Cambridge St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Kertzer, Joshua D.] Harvard Univ, Dept Govt, 1737 Cambridge St,K206, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",,"Huff, C (corresponding author), Harvard Univ, Dept Govt, 1737 Cambridge St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",cdezzanihuff@fas.harvard.edu; jkertzer@gov.harvard.edu,,,Weatherhead Center for International Affairs; Institute for Quantitative Social Science; Niehaus Center for Globalization and Governance,Weatherhead Center for International Affairs; Institute for Quantitative Social Science; Niehaus Center for Globalization and Governance,"We thank Bob Bates, Mia Bloom, Alex Braithwaite, Dara Kay Cohen, Naoki Egami, Marcus Holmes, Jeff Kaplow, In Song Kim, Melia Pfannenstiel, Peter Vining, Ariel White, Thomas Zeitzoff, and audiences at the Political Violence Workshop at Harvard University, ISA 2016, MPSA 2016, Trinity College, Dublin, andWilliam and Mary for helpful comments, suggestions, and assistance.

This field applies computational methods to novel sources of digital data such as social media, administrative records, and historical archives to develop theories of human behavior. We review the evolution of this field within sociology via bibliometric analysis and in-depth analysis of the following subfields where this new work is appearing most rapidly: (a) social network analysis and group formation; (b) collective behavior and political sociology; (c) the sociology of knowledge; (d) cultural sociology, social psychology, and emotions; (e) the production of culture; ( f) economic sociology and organizations; and (g) demography and population studies. Our review reveals that sociologists are not only at the center of cutting-edge research that addresses longstanding questions about human behavior but also developing new lines of inquiry about digital spaces as well. We conclude by discussing challenging new obstacles in the field, calling for increased attention to sociological theory, and identifying new areas where computational social science might be further integrated into mainstream sociology.","[Edelmann, Achim] Univ Bern, Inst Sociol, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland; [Edelmann, Achim] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Sociol, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Wolff, Tom; Montagne, Danielle; Bail, Christopher A.] Duke Univ, Dept Sociol, Durham, NC 27708 USA",,"Edelmann, A (corresponding author), Univ Bern, Inst Sociol, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland.;Edelmann, A (corresponding author), London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Sociol, London WC2A 2AE, England.",achim.edelmann@soz.unibe.ch; christopher.bail@duke.edu,,"Edelmann, Achim/0000-0001-8293-674X",NICHD NIH HHS [P2C HD065563] Funding Source: Medline,NICHD NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD)),,,138,29,32,27,78,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",0360-0572,1545-2115,978-0-8243-2246-5,ANNU REV SOCIOL,Annu.

The study found divergent disclosure practices across websites, between language and visual disclosures, and between native ad links on the homepage and native ad posts on story pages within a website. Overall, older organizations with more Pulitzer awards and younger organizations with relatively more Pulitzer awards and social media followers seemed to execute clearer disclosure. Moreover, the organizations with more Pulitzer awards seemed to impose a clearer disclosure language on native ad links at gateway locations than those with fewer awards but lessened disclosure of native ad posts on the landing pages. The older news websites with more social media followers adopted an obscurer disclosure language of native ad links but distinguished native ad posts more once audiences landed on the content page. This study recommends media effect scholars take a holistic approach to assess ad recognition and suggest publishers build on cultural capital as an ultimate defense against heteronomous forces.","[Li, You] Eastern Michigan Univ, School Commun Media & Theatre Arts, Ypsilanti, MI 48197 USA; [Wang, Ye] Univ Missouri, Dept Commun, Kansas City, MO 64110 USA",,"Li, Y (corresponding author), Eastern Michigan Univ, School Commun Media & Theatre Arts, Ypsilanti, MI 48197 USA.",yli23@emich.edu,,,,,,,66,0,0,1,1,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

We contribute to the literature on party platform change by theorizing and assessing how party performance motivates parties to change their platform in-between elections. We built a new and unique dataset of >20,000 press releases issued by 15 Dutch national political parties that were in parliament between 1997 and 2014. Utilizing automated text analysis (topic modeling) to measure parties' platform change, we show that electoral defeat motivates party platform change in-between elections.

A little-understood aspect of this phenomenon and of the processing of online news in general is how sources influence whether people believe and share what they read. In contrast to the predigital era, the Internet makes it easy for anyone to imitate well-known and credible sources in name and appearance. In a preregistered survey experiment, we first investigate the effect of this contrast (real vs. fake source) and find that subjects, as expected, have a higher tendency to believe and a somewhat higher propensity to share news by real sources. We then expose subjects to a number of reports manipulated in content (congruent vs. incongruent with individuals' attitudes), which reveals our most crucial finding. As predicted, people are more likely to believe a news report by a source that has previously given them congruent information. However, this only holds if the source is fake. We further use machine learning to uncover treatment heterogeneity. Effects vary most strongly for different levels of trust in the mainstream media and having voted for the populist right.","[Bauer, Paul C.] Univ Mannheim, Mannheim Ctr European Social Res MZES, D-68131 Mannheim, Germany; [Clemm von Hohenberg, Bernhard] European Univ Inst, Dept Social & Polit Sci, Florence, Italy",,"Bauer, PC (corresponding author), Univ Mannheim, Mannheim Ctr European Social Res MZES, D-68131 Mannheim, Germany.",mail@paulcbauer.eu,,"Clemm von Hohenberg, Bernhard/0000-0002-6976-9745; Bauer, Paul Cornelius/0000-0002-8382-9724",,,,,105,4,4,7,59,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1058-4609,1091-7675,,POLIT COMMUN,Polit.

While it might facilitate the research process, there are also concerns about their impact on journalism. Based on reconstruction interviews with 27 journalists, we first answer the primary question to what extent journalists actually use algorithmic-driven tools for research purposes. Then, we analyze which folk theories journalists create during their use of algorithm-driven tools. Results show that algorithmic tools specifically designed for the journalistic research process are rarely or not at all used. Yet, more crucially, search engines and social media, that are driven by algorithms, play a major role when it comes to the search, selection, and verification of sources and information. However, journalists are not aware of this hidden research assistant facilitating their research process. When explicitly asked, they profess specific notions regarding the use of algorithmic-driven tools in the form of folk theories, which are predominantly negative regarding the influence of AI on journalism. At the same time, there is a still a strong feeling of a professional authority among journalists who feel they are able to work autonomously of any kind of influence, including algorithms.","[de Haan, Yael; van den Berg, Eric; Goutier, Nele] HU Univ Appl Sci Utrecht, Res Ctr Journalism Digital Transit, Utrecht, Netherlands; [Kruikemeier, Sanne] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Sch Commun Res ASCoR, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Lecheler, Sophie] Univ Vienna, Dept Commun, Vienna, Austria",,"de Haan, Y (corresponding author), HU Univ Appl Sci Utrecht, Res Ctr Journalism Digital Transit, Utrecht, Netherlands.",yael.dehaan@hu.nl,,"Kruikemeier, Sanne/0000-0002-8053-8200; Lecheler, Sophie/0000-0001-7320-1012",,,,,61,1,1,8,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

However, recent theorizing and evidence has cast doubts on the universal applicability of the echo chamber metaphor, pointing out that communication effects on opinion expression are much more complex than the metaphor suggests. Using the refugee crisis in Germany as a background, the current study challenges four implicit premises of the echo chamber metaphor empirically. The findings show a more complex picture than the metaphor implies: (1) Ignoring other information sources beyond SM may lead to severe misinterpretations; seeming evidence for echo chambers disappears after controlling for news media use. (2) SM reliance does not generally stimulate opinion expression. (3) Attitude extremity moderates the effect of SM reliance, suggesting that people with more extreme views are susceptible to echo chamber effects. (4) Attitude position on the issue-at-hand moderates the effect of SM reliance, which suggests that echo chambers do not completely shield their users from the public discourse. We propose the Echo Chamber Continuum (ECCo) Model to stimulate developing the echo chamber metaphor into a theory suitable for studying opinion formation.","[Geiss, Stefan; Magin, Melanie] NTNU, Dept Sociol & Polit Sci, Trondheim, Norway; [Juergens, Pascal; Stark, Birgit] Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Dept Commun, Mainz, Germany",,"Geiss, S (corresponding author), NTNU, Dept Sociol & Polit Sci, Trondheim, Norway.",stefan.geiss@ntnu.no,,"Jurgens, Pascal/0000-0002-6810-0011; Magin, Melanie/0000-0003-2545-3594",Media Authority of North Rhine-Westphalia (Landesanstalt fur Medien Nordrhein-Westfalen); Research Unit Media Convergence at the Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz,Media Authority of North Rhine-Westphalia (Landesanstalt fur Medien Nordrhein-Westfalen); Research Unit Media Convergence at the Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz,This study was financially supported by the Media Authority of North Rhine-Westphalia (Landesanstalt fur Medien Nordrhein-Westfalen) and the Research Unit Media Convergence at the Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz.,,48,4,4,33,62,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

However, while these kinds of sentiment scores can capture the overall tone of a document, the underlying concept of interest for political analysis is often actually the document's stance with respect to a given target-how positively or negatively it frames a specific idea, individual, or group-as this reflects the author's underlying political attitudes. In this paper, we question the validity of approximating author stance through sentiment scoring in the analysis of political texts, and advocate for greater attention to be paid to the conceptual distinction between a document's sentiment and its stance. Using examples from open-ended survey responses and from political discussions on social media, we demonstrate that in many political text analysis applications, sentiment and stance do not necessarily align, and therefore sentiment analysis methods fail to reliably capture ground-truth document stance, amplifying noise in the data and leading to faulty conclusions.","[Bestvater, Samuel E.; Monroe, Burt L.] Penn State Univ, Dept Polit Sci, University Pk, PA 16802 USA",,"Bestvater, SE (corresponding author), Penn State Univ, Dept Polit Sci, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",seb654@psu.edu; burtmonroe@psu.edu,,"Bestvater, Samuel/0000-0003-0301-0100",Center for Social Data Analytics at Pennsylvania State University,Center for Social Data Analytics at Pennsylvania State University,Funding for this project was provided by the Center for Social Data Analytics at Pennsylvania State University.,,35,0,0,4,4,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1047-1987,1476-4989,,POLIT ANAL,Polit.

Based on in-depth interviews, our findings suggest that, far beyond their origins as comment field moderators, SMEs now play a crucial role in integrating complex behavioral data from social network sites and circulating this data in the newsroom to align news production with perceived audience tastes. Our findings also suggest that while SMEs identify with traditional norms of professional journalism, they also work closely with staff in marketing departments and draw on marketing language and imagery when describing their work. Ultimately, we find that our SME participants experience their increasingly central role in the newsroom in contradictory and ambivalent ways, at times defending traditional professional values, while at other times voicing support for audience sovereignty and giving readers what they want. In this way, if Pierre Bourdieu's field theory suggests that journalism is structured by an ongoing struggle between exogeneous (commercial and marketing) logics and endogenous professional values, the changing roles of SMEs indicate the arrival of a new stage in this struggle - a stage marked by the deep and virtually uncontested advance of marketing terminology and goals into the journalistic field. In this restructured professional field, individual SMEs are thus left with the difficult task of reconciling, at the level of habitus, internalized tensions between ascendant marketing imperatives and residual but still-cherished journalistic dispositions and values.","[Neilson, Tai] Macquarie Univ, Dept Media Commun Creat Arts Language & Literatur, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Gibson, Timothy A.] George Mason Univ, Dept Commun, Fairfax, VA USA",,"Neilson, T (corresponding author), Macquarie Univ, Dept Media Commun Creat Arts Language & Literatur, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",tai.neilson@mq.edu.au,"Gibson, Timothy/GLQ-6090-2022","Gibson, Timothy/0000-0003-3986-8774; Neilson, Tai/0000-0002-5109-5850",,,,,54,3,3,0,0,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

Distinguishing trolls from activists can be difficult; democratic theorists have yet to adequately address how to prevent the former while remaining open to the latter. In this article, I outline a theory of democratic politics that takes space as a central element in shaping democratic interactions. Using the work of John Dewey, I draw out two key characteristics of democratic space: boundedness and flexibility. Using these criteria, I then evaluate Kinja, Gawker Media's commenting platform, both before and after trolls attacked the site in 2014. I find that in altering its boundaries to successfully protect against trolls, Kinja introduced a new problem: a lack of flexibility that continues to affect the possibility for democratic discourse on the platform. I conclude by suggesting how this theory of democratic space might shape future research.","[Forestal, Jennifer] Stockton Univ, 101 Vera King Farris Dr, Galloway, NJ 08205 USA",,"Forestal, J (corresponding author), Stockton Univ, 101 Vera King Farris Dr, Galloway, NJ 08205 USA.",jennifer.forestal@stockton.edu,,"Forestal, Jennifer/0000-0003-1153-0552",,,,,39,12,12,1,26,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0003-0554,1537-5943,,AM POLIT SCI REV,Am.

Our proposed solution is to estimate a low-dimensional summary of the text and condition on this summary via matching. We propose a method of text matching, topical inverse regression matching, that allows the analyst to match both on the topical content of confounding documents and the probability that each of these documents is treated. We validate our approach and illustrate the importance of conditioning on text to address confounding with two applications: the effect of perceptions of author gender on citation counts in the international relations literature and the effects of censorship on Chinese social media users.","[Roberts, Margaret E.] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Polit Sci, Social Sci Bldg 301,9500 Gilman Dr,0521, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Stewart, Brandon M.] Princeton Univ, Dept Sociol, 149 Wallace Hall, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Nielsen, Richard A.] MIT, Dept Polit Sci, 77 Massachusetts Ave,E53 Room 455, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",,"Roberts, ME (corresponding author), Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Polit Sci, Social Sci Bldg 301,9500 Gilman Dr,0521, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",meroberts@ucsd.edu; bms4@princeton.edu; rnielsen@mit.edu,,,"Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development [P2-CHD047879]; National Science Foundation RIDIR program [1738411, 1738288]; Carnegie Corporation of New York",Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD)); National Science Foundation RIDIR program; Carnegie Corporation of New York,"We thank the following for helpful comments and suggestions on this work: David Blei, Naoki Egami, Chris Felton, James Fowler, Justin Grimmer, Erin Hartman, Chad Hazlett, Seth Hill, Kosuke Imai, Rebecca Johnson, Gary King, Adeline Lo, Will Lowe, Chris Lucas, Walter Mebane, DavidMimno, Jennifer Pan, Marc Ratkovic, Matt Salganik, Caroline Tolbert, and Simone Zhang; audiences at the Princeton Text Analysis Workshop, Princeton Politics Methods Workshop, the University of Rochester, Microsoft Research, the Text as Data Conference, and the PoliticalMethodology Society and the Visions inMethodology conference; and some tremendously helpful anonymous reviewers.

Part of this problem are malicious bots: automated fake accounts passing as humans. However, we lack a systematic understanding of which politicians benefit most from them. We tackle this question by leveraging a Twitter purge of malicious bots in July 2018 and a new dataset on Twitter activity by all members of national parliaments (MPs) in the EU in 2018. Since users had no influence on how and when Twitter purged millions of bots, it serves as an exogenous intervention to investigate whether some parties or politicians lost more followers. We find drops in follower counts concentrated among radical right politicians, in particular those with strong anti-EU discourse. This is the first set of empirical, causally identified evidence supporting the idea that the radical right benefits more from malicious bots than other party families.","[Silva, Bruno Castanho] Univ Cologne, Cologne Ctr Comparat Polit, Cologne, Germany; [Proksch, Sven-Oliver] Univ Cologne, Cologne Ctr Comparat Polit, Polit Sci, Cologne, Germany; [Proksch, Sven-Oliver] Univ Cologne, Cologne Ctr Comparat Polit, European & Multilevel Polit, Cologne, Germany",,"Silva, BC (corresponding author), Univ Cologne, Cologne Ctr Comparat Polit, Cologne, Germany.",bcsilva@wiso.uni-koeln.de; so.proksch@uni-koeln.de,,"Castanho Silva, Bruno/0000-0001-9363-4704; Proksch, Sven-Oliver/0000-0002-6130-6498","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) under Germany's Excellence Strategy [EXC 2126/1-390838866]","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) under Germany's Excellence Strategy(German Research Foundation (DFG))","We would like to thank Danielle Pullan, Pit Rieger, Rebecca Kittel, Leonie Diffene, Felix Reich, Barbara Zucchi Nobre Silva, Jasmin Spekkers, Noam Himmelrath, Lennart Schurmann, and Lea Kaftan for excellent research assistance, and Leo Baccini, Jens Wackerle, Bastian Becker, Ahmet Suerdem, participants of the PolText Conference at Waseda University in Tokyo, September 13-15, 2019, and the three anonymous reviewers for helpful comments and suggestions.

However, recent studies have found that Twitter reproduces existing networks and hierarchies, indicated through homophily where dominant journalistic users with high symbolic capital tend to amplify and engage more with colleagues of similar symbolic status, which legitimizes their authority and dominance in the public sphere. Still, an in-depth understanding of how this manifests and might be rectified is lacking. To fill this gap, we explore the tweeting behaviour of 356 journalists in Austria, as social capital and personal networks are especially relevant to be recognized by peers. Our findings show strong homophilous tweeting behaviour for those with high professional reputation and for men. New entrants aim more towards gaining visibility in these tight-knit groups.","[Maares, Phoebe; Lind, Fabienne] Univ Vienna, Dept Commun, Vienna, Austria; [Greussing, Esther] Tech Univ Carolo Wilhelmina Braunschweig, Inst Commun Sci, Braunschweig, Germany",,"Maares, P (corresponding author), Univ Vienna, Dept Commun, Vienna, Austria.",phoebe.maares@univie.ac.at,"Maares, Phoebe/AAD-9907-2022; Maares, Phoebe/AAJ-5350-2021","Maares, Phoebe/0000-0002-9518-7132; , Fabienne/0000-0002-4978-9415; Greussing, Esther/0000-0001-8655-5119","Faculty of Social Science, University of Vienna","Faculty of Social Science, University of Vienna","The authors would like to thank Oscar Westlund and the two anonymous reviewers for their helpful comments, and the Faculty of Social Science, University of Vienna, for the financial support provided to cover the proofreading costs for this article.",,66,3,3,2,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

The study uncovers the dynamic utilization of time and its impact on the democratic meaning of the 2016 election (or the lack thereof) before, during, and after the election in old and new media.

Scholars are increasingly using text-as-data methods for social science inquiry, driving a need for more training and professionalization of computational political communication as a sub-field. Text-as-data methods are largely borrowed from other disciplines such as linguistics and computer science, but sustained, institutionalized collaboration between scholars in different departments is still somewhat rare. Using the concept of cohesion as an example, I describe how multiple disciplines interpret and operationalize the same term in different ways. Finally, I provide a list of challenges and lessons learned, including the logistics of running a lab, communicating and publishing across disciplines, implications of authorship sequence, and maintaining your own research profile while collaborating.

We make a distinction between alternative/citizen media, digitally born and mainstream media to examine how different types of media play a role in discursively constructing populist logics. Our key findings show that alternative/citizen media forward political acts and rights-claims for the people by the people, whereas mainstream media generally invite elite sources to speak for the people.

I argue that where governments provide Internet access, surveillance of digital information exchange can provide intelligence that enables the use of more targeted forms of repression, in particular in areas not fully controlled by the regime. Increasing restrictions on Internet accessibility can impede opposition organization, but they limit access to information on precise targets, resulting in an increase in untargeted repression. I present new data on killings in the Syrian conflict that distinguish between targeted and untargeted events, using supervised text classification. I find that higher levels of Internet accessibility are associated with increases in targeted repression, whereas areas with limited access experience more indiscriminate campaigns of violence.

We assess validity by comparing the Wordscores estimates to expert surveys and other judgmental measures, and by examining the Wordscores's estimates ability to predict party membership in the European Parliament groups.

Unable to rely on contradictory or deliberately distorted media accounts, socially interactive audiences turn to trustworthy others to make sense of the political world outside. This study uses the context of the Russian-Ukrainian conflict, marked by discordant media agendas and ideological narratives, to explore how citizens produce shared understandings of conflicting political issues. It draws upon a series of focus groups with media audiences in Eastern Ukraine to explore the socially embedded, interactive reconstruction and renegotiation of shared meaning. Based on a discourse and conversation analysis of the content, group dynamics, and non-verbal cues in the discussions, the study distinguishes three interaction modes (inquiry, narrative, and avoidance) that define the conditions for audiences' opinion formation. The findings show that cooperation in inquiry mode facilitates deliberation, the adoption of rigid consensual boundaries in narrative mode increases polarization, whereas cynical detachment in avoidance mode preserves confusion. The article concludes by discussing the implications for socially mediated meaning-making and democratic potential of political talk.","[Pasitselska, Olga] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Commun & Journalism, Jerusalem, Israel",,"Pasitselska, O (corresponding author), Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Commun & Journalism, Jerusalem, Israel.",olga.pasitselska@mail.huji.ac.il,,"Pasitselska, Olga/0000-0003-1306-2318",,,,,83,0,0,12,12,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1058-4609,1091-7675,,POLIT COMMUN,Polit.

Drawing on a study of Big Brother Israel, we demonstrate how several structural-interactional features of the show encourage viewers to shift from a position of bystanders to one of confidants and companions of the contestants. We analyze this shift through the lens of mediated public intimacy-the staging of exclusive interactions in front of a third party. The emergent sense of collective complicity affects everyday interactions between viewers and public discourse on social media. We conclude that beyond the public staging of self, it is the staging and concretization of social relations in media events that serves to reaffirm the collective's solidarity.","[Kaplan, Danny; Kupper, Yoni] Bar Ilan Univ, Dept Sociol & Anthropol, IL-5290002 Ramat Gan, Israel",,"Kaplan, D (corresponding author), Bar Ilan Univ, Dept Sociol & Anthropol, IL-5290002 Ramat Gan, Israel.",danny@dannykaplan.org,,,Hammer Scholarship of the Second Authority for Television and Radio,Hammer Scholarship of the Second Authority for Television and Radio,"We would like to thank Yaacov Yadgar, Paul Frosh, Oren Livio, and Oren Soffer for their valuable suggestions and advice during various stages of this work as well as our colleagues at the department of Sociology and Anthropology at Bar Ilan University for their feedback on this project and continued support.

Authoritarian Control in the Age of Digital Surveillance,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,SOCIAL MEDIA; INFORMATION; CHALLENGES,"This article studies the consequences of digital surveillance in dictatorships. I first develop an informational theory of repression and co-optation. I argue that digital surveillance resolves dictators' information problem of not knowing individual citizens' true anti-regime sentiments. By identifying radical opponents, digital surveillance enables dictators to substitute targeted repression for nonexclusive co-optation to forestall coordinated uprisings. My theory implies that as digital surveillance technologies advance, we should observe a rise in targeted repression and a decline in universal redistribution. Using a difference-in-differences design that exploits temporal variation in digital surveillance systems among Chinese counties, I find that surveillance increases local governments' public security expenditure and arrests of political activists but decreases public goods provision. My theory and evidence suggest that improvements in governments' information make citizens worse off in dictatorships.","[Xu, Xu] Penn State Univ, Dept Polit Sci, 210 Pond Lab, University Pk, PA 16802 USA",,"Xu, X (corresponding author), Penn State Univ, Dept Polit Sci, 210 Pond Lab, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",xux112@psu.edu,,,,,,,59,25,25,4,28,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0092-5853,1540-5907,,AM J POLIT SCI,Am.

Against this backdrop, we conducted an online experiment with a diverse sample of U.S. citizens (N = 1,404) to investigate the credibility of textual versus multimodal (text-plus-visual) disinformation, and the effects of textual and multimodal fact checkers in refuting disinformation on school shootings and refugees. Our findings indicate that, irrespective of the source, multimodal disinformation is considered slightly more credible than textual disinformation. Fact checkers can help to overcome the potential harmful consequences of disinformation. We also found that fact checkers can overcome partisan and attitudinal filters - which points to the relevance of fact checking as a journalistic discipline.","[Hameleers, Michael; Powell, Thomas E.; Van Der Meer, Toni G.

Two analytical dimensions of people's media use - practice and perception - are tested on survey data from Norway (N = 1692) using a network analysis approach combined with media experience data. The study finds substantial convergence in use of different online and offline media with the largest audience overlap occurring between online local and regional newspapers and Facebook. These digital players represent the backbone of the local media environment under study. Overall, citizens' experiences with different media as democratic resources for their local public life are not very strong and weaker for online media than for their offline editions.","[Olsen, Ragnhild Kristine] BI Norwegian Business Sch, Dept Commun & Culture, Oslo, Norway",,"Olsen, RK (corresponding author), BI Norwegian Business Sch, Dept Commun & Culture, Oslo, Norway.",ragnhild.k.olsen@bi.no,,"Olsen, Ragnhild Kristine/0000-0003-3072-8046",Research Council of Norway (Norges Forskningsrad) as part of The Program on the Culture and Media Sector (KULMEDIA) [247602],Research Council of Norway (Norges Forskningsrad) as part of The Program on the Culture and Media Sector (KULMEDIA)(Research Council of Norway),This work was supported by the Research Council of Norway (Norges Forskningsrad) under project number 247602 as part of The Program on the Culture and Media Sector (KULMEDIA).,,64,2,2,0,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

I argue that certain modalities, particularly the channel and structure of a media platform, facilitate the perception of media as more uncivil even if the content is kept the same. To test this argument, I conduct two survey experiments in which participants are randomly assigned to treatments in which the substantive content and text remains the same but is packaged to mimic different media types. Generally, audio and video increase awareness of incivility cues as well as participants' evaluations of negative, emotional, and entertaining tone. There are also differences in the extent to which individuals notice incivility on Twitter than on other text-based media platforms. The social media platform is also particularly entertaining in comparison to the other platforms studied. This article demonstrates that media attributes interact to shape our understanding and identification of uncivil language. Furthermore, it suggests that more attention should be focused on identifying the different sets of characteristics that make incivility more or less likely or salient in political media.","[Sydnor, Emily] Southwestern Univ, Georgetown, TX USA",,"Sydnor, E (corresponding author), 1001 E Univ Ave, Georgetown, TX 78626 USA.",sydnore@southwestern.edu,,,Southwestern University; University of Virginia Political Psychology Working Group,Southwestern University; University of Virginia Political Psychology Working Group,The author would like to acknowledge Southwestern University and the University of Virginia Political Psychology Working Group for their financial support for this project.,,46,19,19,2,23,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1058-4609,1091-7675,,POLIT COMMUN,Polit.

In the context of elections, search engines may serve to inform citizens and have been argued to sway the choices of undecided voters. I examine two related issues: How political parties and candidates are represented in Google Search results and how strongly results in both Google Search and Google News are personalized in the run up to the 2017 German general elections. My results suggest that some parties and candidates are able to exert greater influence over how they are represented in search results than others, through a combination of local branch websites and social media presences.

In a major extension of existing research, we show that positive short-term effects of platforms mask detrimental long-term effects. Drawing on a four-month tracking dataset and a comprehensive content analysis covering the online news consumption of over 10,000 German citizens, we demonstrate that even though short-term usage of platforms uniformly increases exposure diversity, long-term reliance can lead to decreases. In addition, platforms vary in their influences: News aggregators are beneficial to exposure diversity, while Twitter and search engines have a limiting effect; Facebook offers no significant influence.","[Juergens, Pascal; Stark, Birgit] Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Dept Commun, Jakob Welder Weg 12, D-55099 Mainz, Rhineland Palat, Germany",,"Jurgens, P (corresponding author), Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Dept Commun, Jakob Welder Weg 12, D-55099 Mainz, Rhineland Palat, Germany.",pascal.juergens@uni-mainz.de,,"Jurgens, Pascal/0000-0002-6810-0011",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) [STA1437/3-1],Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)),This project was funded by Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) through grant STA1437/3-1.,,57,0,0,9,9,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0021-9916,1460-2466,,J COMMUN,J.

We analyze social media and digital mobilizing to examine how, in the midst of social protest, linguistic and semiotic tools indexed historicity, contemporaneity, and futurity through relational strategies that are not just textual and discursive, but also historical, social, and political. Throughout this essay, we share examples of intertextual and interdiscursive strategies that marked particular moments of protest as articulations of historical precedents, imperial and colonial presents, and alternative futures. These examples reveal how collective identities (i.e. el pueblo) are mobilized in social protest to generate counternarratives that address structures and systems rather than locate social critiques in particular individuals and political parties. In shedding light on the intra-Caribbean solidarities that emerge over time, this analysis also points to a need to examine the erasures (Gal and Irvine 2019) performed through claims to unity and collective organizing.","[Hamm-Rodriguez, Molly] Univ Colorado, Sch Educ, Program Equ Bilingualism & Biliteracy, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Medina, Carmen Liliana] Indiana Univ, Dept Curriculum & Instruct, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA",,"Hamm-Rodriguez, M (corresponding author), Univ Colorado, Sch Educ, Program Equ Bilingualism & Biliteracy, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",Molly.hamm@colorado.edu,,,,,,,11,0,0,1,1,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0142-6001,1477-450X,,APPL LINGUIST,Appl.

Recent applications include large data sets of various types including roll calls, surveys, and textual and social media data. To overcome the resulting computational challenges, we propose fast estimation methods for ideal points with massive data. We derive the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithms to estimate the standard ideal point model with binary, ordinal, and continuous outcome variables. We then extend this methodology to dynamic and hierarchical ideal point models by developing variational EM algorithms for approximate inference. We demonstrate the computational efficiency and scalability of our methodology through a variety of real and simulated data. In cases where a standard Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm would require several days to compute ideal points, the proposed algorithm can produce essentially identical estimates within minutes. Open-source software is available for implementing the proposed methods.","[Imai, Kosuke] Princeton Univ, Dept Polit, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Imai, Kosuke] Princeton Univ, Ctr Stat & Machine Learning, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Lo, James] Univ Southern Calif, Dept Polit Sci, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA; [Olmsted, Jonathan] NPD Grp, Port Washington, NY 11050 USA",,"Imai, K (corresponding author), Princeton Univ, Dept Polit, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.;Imai, K (corresponding author), Princeton Univ, Ctr Stat & Machine Learning, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",kimai@princeton.edu; lojames@usc.edu; jpolmsted@gmail.com,"Imai, Kosuke/B-7462-2008","Imai, Kosuke/0000-0002-2748-1022",,,,,59,36,37,1,20,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0003-0554,1537-5943,,AM POLIT SCI REV,Am.

While early research preoccupied itself with the hostile nature of comments posted on such forums, and the issue of moderation, recent studies have focused on two interlocking questions: the extent to which professional news organizations, and the journalists they employ, are buying into the value of encouraging audience-members to comment on their articles and how successfully (or not) news-makers are using threads to forge virtual  communities. While the purpose of constructing such communities has largely been viewed through a utilitarian prism-as a means of drawing in traffic, building brand loyalty and generating income-consideration has also been given to threads as vehicles for empowering citizens, by allowing them to debate and/or contest the authority of professionally written news texts and/or establishment narratives. This article aims to go further, by building on an emerging strand of research which conceives of discussion posts less as adjuncts, or mere responses, to journalists' articles than extensions of them. It argues that the most valuable evidence-based posts add background detail, colour and context that can greatly enhance- and help make complete-otherwise unfinished stories.","[Morrison, James] Robert Gordon Univ, Aberdeen Business Sch, Dept Commun Mkt & Media, Aberdeen AB9 1FR, Scotland",,"Morrison, J (corresponding author), Robert Gordon Univ, Aberdeen Business Sch, Dept Commun Mkt & Media, Aberdeen AB9 1FR, Scotland.",j.g.morrison@rgu.ac.uk,,,,,,,52,2,2,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

To facilitate a clean cross-national comparison, we focus on the same person and measurement in 12 Western democracies, that is, the use of the pejorative terms sexist, racist, dictator, and equivalents to describe Donald Trump. Our manually validated automated content analysis (2016-2018; N = 27,830) shows that content varies along with countries' media and authoritarian history: pejoration is more common in countries with a polarized pluralist media system and former authoritarian countries than elsewhere. Newspapers' ideology does not matter, irrespective of countries' level of political parallelism or experiences with authoritarianism. Combined, we provide new methodological and theoretical handles to further comparative communication research in Western democracies.","[de Leeuw, Sjifra E.; Azrout, Rachid; Rekker, Roderik S.

Such news distribution is relevant because it (a) bypasses social media and news aggregators, reaching readers directly; (b) alters the agency and control of temporal news personalisation; and (c) reinforces mobile as the locus of contact between news organisations and audiences. However, push notifications are a relatively under-researched topic. We explore news organisations' use of alerts, considering whether they attempt to integrate with existing mobile-user behaviour patterns or seek to be a disruptive element, garnering attention when audiences are not typically using devices. Through quantitative content analysis, this study examines the temporality of push notifications (n = 7092) from nine Northwestern European countries, comprising 34 news outlets. These data allow for comparisons at two levels: publisher type and national context. The study shows how the temporal patterns of push notifications' dissemination align with existing news consumption behaviours; concepts of content-snacking and audiences' rhythms and rituals are a useful lens through which these immediate, concise texts can be considered. Our findings show that news organisations use the mobile channel for attracting and maintaining users' attention, with varying interpretations of temporal customisability.","[Wheatley, Dawn] Dublin City Univ, Sch Commun, Dublin, Ireland; [Ferrer-Conill, Raul] Karlstad Univ, Dept Geog Media & Commun, Karlstad, Sweden; [Ferrer-Conill, Raul] Univ Stavanger, Dept Media & Social Sci, Stavanger, Norway",,"Ferrer-Conill, R (corresponding author), Karlstad Univ, Dept Geog Media & Commun, Karlstad, Sweden.;Ferrer-Conill, R (corresponding author), Univ Stavanger, Dept Media & Social Sci, Stavanger, Norway.",raul.ferrer@kau.se,"; Ferrer Conill, Raul/G-3347-2014","Wheatley, Dawn/0000-0002-8751-4535; Ferrer Conill, Raul/0000-0002-0501-2217",,,,,55,4,4,7,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

In 2014, Google security experts found that 21 of the world's 25 most popular media outlets were targets of state-sponsored hacking attempts, and many journalists have watched helplessly as hackers took control of their social media accounts, targeting confidential information in their internal servers. When journalists' digital accounts are vulnerable to hacks or surveillance, news organizations, journalists, and their sources are at risk, and journalists' ability to carry out their news making function is reduced. Yet, some journalists do not believe that hacking and surveillance are significant threats, and they are not adopting information security measures to protect their data, themselves, or their sources. This research study includes 19 interviews with journalists, developers, and digital security trainers to shed light on journalists' perceptions of information security technologies, including motivations to adopt and barriers to adoption. The findings show that motivations to adopt information security technologies hinge on the idea of protection: protection of self, story, and the journalist's role-more so than the protection of the source, contrary to contemporary discourse about why journalists need to adopt such technologies.","[Henrichsen, Jennifer R.] Univ Penn, Annenberg Sch Commun, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",,"Henrichsen, JR (corresponding author), Univ Penn, Annenberg Sch Commun, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",jhenrichsen@asc.upenn.edu,,,,,,,43,3,3,1,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

We empirically assess the consequences of these approaches based on both a quantitative comparison of models and a qualitative validation of each method's potentials and weaknesses. Our case study uses two text collections (of tweets and news articles) in three languages (English, Hebrew, Arabic), covering the ongoing local conflicts between Israeli authorities, settlers, and Palestinian Bedouins in the West Bank. We find that both methods produce a large share of equivalent topics, especially in the context of fairly homogenous news discourse, yet show limited but systematic differences when applied to highly heterogenous social media discourse. While the MD model delivers a more nuanced picture of conflict-related topics, it misses several more peripheral topics, especially those unrelated to the dictionary's focus, which are picked up by the MT model.

Against the background of a hybrid media system, we pursue three research goals. First, we evaluate the scope of the Twitter-in-the-news phenomenon relative to news coverage as a whole. Second, we examine the functions of embedded tweets. Third, we identify characteristics that increase the likelihood that tweets will be selected for publication in a news article. We combine computational methods with a manual content analysis and analyze political news coverage of one month outside election periods in four German online news outlets. Our results show that embedding tweets in the news is not a niche phenomenon but has been established as a routine journalistic practice to a moderate extent. In the majority of news articles, the function of tweets is to illustrate an argument or information provided in the text. Geographical proximity and - with some dependencies - the number of popularity cues increased the likelihood of a tweet to be picked up for reporting. The paper shows how transformation processes currently observed in journalism manifest themselves in reporting.","[Oschatz, Corinna] Univ Koblenz Landau, Dept Commun Psychol & Media Educ, Landau, Germany; [Stier, Sebastian] GESIS Leibniz Inst Social Sci, Dept Computat Social Sci, Cologne, Germany; [Maier, Juergen] Univ Koblenz Landau, Dept Polit Sci, Landau, Germany",,"Oschatz, C (corresponding author), Univ Koblenz Landau, Dept Commun Psychol & Media Educ, Landau, Germany.",oschatz@uni-landau.de,"Stier, Sebastian/AAH-4394-2019; Maier, Jürgen/ABH-7963-2020","Stier, Sebastian/0000-0002-1217-5778; Maier, Jürgen/0000-0001-8301-5125; Oschatz, Corinna/0000-0003-3276-5721",,,,,53,5,5,0,1,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

Drawing on genre as a social action, we explore the ways in which churnalism is changing news consumption. New news genres are appearing in response to new social interactions that users repeatedly act out predominantly online. As users, we produce and consume texts which we refer to as news in multiple situations which can be sorted into patterns. Our comparative analysis offers surprising insights into how these patterns form new news genres, characteristic of social media (many-to-many) instead of mass media (one-to-many). Genres should be studied not only through textual analysis but also through the prism of social reality and recurrent social actions, particularly now that users, rather than journalists, are taking a dominant role in identifying what constitutes news genres. Our perception of what defines news is determined by the changing ways in which we consume news.","[Rulyova, Natalia] Univ Birmingham, Dept Modern Languages, Birmingham, W Midlands, England; [Westley, Hannah] Amer Univ Paris, Dept Global Commun, Paris, France",,"Westley, H (corresponding author), Amer Univ Paris, Dept Global Commun, Paris, France.",n.e.rulyova@bham.ac.uk; hwestley@aup.edu,,"Rulyova, Natalia/0000-0003-2840-4595",Marie Curie funding; AHRC [AH/K000160/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Arts and Humanities Research Council [AH/K000160/1] Funding Source: researchfish,Marie Curie funding; AHRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Arts & Humanities Research Council (AHRC)); Arts and Humanities Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Arts & Humanities Research Council (AHRC)),Natalia Rulyova was awarded Marie Curie funding to visit the city of Perm in December 2016 on a scholars' exchange programme.,,55,5,5,5,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

Yet successes with this method have largely been confined to massive corpora where the meanings of words are presumed to be fixed. In political science applications, however, many corpora are comparatively small and many interesting questions hinge on the recognition that meaning changes over time. Together, these two facts raise vexing methodological challenges. Can word vectors trace the changing cultural meanings of words in typical small corpora use cases? I test four time-sensitive implementations of word vectors (word2vec) against a gold standard developed from a modest data set of 161 years of newspaper coverage. I find that one implementation method clearly outperforms the others in matching human assessments of how public dialogues around equality in America have changed over time. In addition, I suggest best practices for using word2vec to study small corpora for time series questions, including bootstrap resampling of documents and pretraining of vectors. I close by showing that word2vec allows granular analysis of the changing meaning of words, an advance over other common text-as-data methods for semantic research questions.","[Rodman, Emma] Univ Washington, Dept Polit Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",,"Rodman, E (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Dept Polit Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",erodman@uw.edu,,,Center for American Politics and Public Policy (CAPPP) at the University of Washington; National Science Foundation [1243917],Center for American Politics and Public Policy (CAPPP) at the University of Washington; National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"This work was supported by the Center for American Politics and Public Policy (CAPPP) at the University of Washington and by the National Science Foundation [#1243917].

We argue that a topically heterogeneous landscape of right-wing populist alternative news outlets could maximize the reach of right-wing populist messages. Using LDA topic modeling, we explore the topical structures of nine different outlets (n = 66,965 articles) and empirically identify meaningful groups of outlets. Our analyses suggest the existence of two topically heterogeneous clusters of alternative news media: (1) core right-wing populist outlets, with around 45-50% of articles coming from topics that are related to right-wing or populist politics; and (2) topically diverse outlets. The latter group's topic selection also reveals right-wing populist partisanship, but less prominently so, while putting more emphasis on general interest news topics, such as sports, economy, or international relations. This group also includes Russian state-owned RT deutsch and Falun Gong-affiliated Epoch Times whose institutional roots, however, are only partially reflected in their topic selection. Additionally, longitudinal analyses reveal an increase of populism-related topics in both groups around the election date of the 2017 German federal election.","[Mueller, Philipp; Freudenthaler, Rainer] Univ Mannheim, Inst Media & Commun Res, Mannheim, Germany",,"Muller, P (corresponding author), Univ Mannheim, Inst Media & Commun Res, Mannheim, Germany.",p.mueller@uni-mannheim.de,,"Freudenthaler, Rainer/0000-0002-9075-1232; Muller, Philipp/0000-0002-5351-0608",,,,,69,0,0,0,0,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

Applying the concept of articulation, wherein an array of terms are juxtaposed and expressed together, this paper examines how the term data-driven journalism is represented on social media. Focusing on the Twittersphere as the research context, the paper employed the Twitter search application programming interface (API) to harvest all available public tweets (N = 6951) containing hashtags or keywords related to data-driven journalism within a four-week period in late 2016. A text-mining analysis of the contents of these tweets found that they focused extensively on journalistic practices, data visualization, and data analytical techniques. Further analysis on the hashtag co-occurrence network revealed that a number of hashtags bridged and organized the discussion of data-driven journalism in the Twittersphere. Some hashtags on technologies and commercial applications, such as #dataviz, #bigdata, and #datajournalism, were located at important positions in the network. In contrast, public-related terms, such as #opendata or #opengovernment, were mentioned in a limited way and positioned peripherally. Implications for journalism and society are discussed.","[Zhang, Xinzhi] Hong Kong Baptist Univ, Dept Journalism, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",,"Zhang, XZ (corresponding author), Hong Kong Baptist Univ, Dept Journalism, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",xzzhang2@gmail.com,"Zhang, Xinzhi/S-9610-2019","Zhang, Xinzhi/0000-0003-3479-9327",Faculty Research Grant (FRG) of Hong Kong Baptist University [FRG1/16-17/020],Faculty Research Grant (FRG) of Hong Kong Baptist University,A part of this study was funded by a Faculty Research Grant (FRG) of Hong Kong Baptist University [FRG1/16-17/020].,,44,4,4,5,38,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

In addition, digital news offers the unique opportunity for readers to engage with the news contents, allowing an analysis of the dynamics of emotional reactions to crisis news coverage. We explore the case of Austria as an early COVID-19 hotspot. We analyse digital news coverage of two high-circulation newspapers and the emotionality it prompted in user comments, based on a unique dataset comprising 38,253 articles and around 1.6 Million comments from 1 January 2020 to 30 June 2020. Results show increased emotionality during lockdown and towards the government.

Much of this literature has focused on politicians running for office and women who hold legislative office. Little research investigates gendered news media presentations of women as heads of government. While the literature predicts that women heads of government should experience gendered differences in news coverage, there is also good reason to expect that news about government operations should not vary based on the gender of the government leader. Using their first year of online news coverage (N = 11,675), we build a series of dictionaries and use automated content analysis to assess how frequently heads of government's uniqueness, gender, family, appearance, sexual orientation, character, and competence are presented. We also assess the tone of news about each head of government. Results show that gendered coverage exists for women heads of government in potentially surprising ways. Fewer new stories are written about them, on average, than men. Women's coverage features more feminine and masculine gendered identifies, as well as more coverage about their clothing. We find little evidence for increased personalization, and women's character and competence are presented more positively than men's. Though blunt, this analysis shows that news about heads of government remains gendered.","[Thomas, Melanee] Univ Calgary, Polit Sci, Calgary, AB, Canada; [Harell, Allison; Gosselin, Tania] Univ Quebec Montreal, Polit Sci, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Rijkhoff, Sanne A.

Against this ideal, the quality of political news in online news outlets is highly contested. While pessimists point out the dangers of increased competition online, optimists emphasize the potential benefits of unlimited space and interactivity. To see which view holds true, this paper compares political news in popular and elite print newspapers and their respective online editions during the 2013 National Election Campaign in Austria. Findings show that online editions score better than paper editions regarding the amount of political news, (party) diversity, and emotionalization, but differences between newspaper types were notable. Whereas elite newspapers cover politics online more extensively than in print, the reverse is true for popular newspapers. Leader focus is also strong in popular papers online. We conclude that the gap in quality between political news in elite and in popular newspapers is larger online. This might contribute to a wider gap between a well-informed elite audience and a lesser-informed popular news audience, when audiences switch from print to online news.","[Jacobi, Carina] Univ Vienna, Dept Commun, A-1010 Vienna, Austria; [Kleinen-von Konigslow, Katharina] Univ Zurich, Inst Mass Commun, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland; [Ruigrok, Nel] Erasmus Univ, Sch Hist Culture & Commun, Rotterdam, Netherlands",,"Jacobi, C (corresponding author), Univ Vienna, Dept Commun, A-1010 Vienna, Austria.",carina.jacobi@univie.ac.at; k.kleinen@ipmz.uzh.ch; nelruigrok@nieuwsmonitor.org,"Konigslow, Katharina Kleinen-von/G-5377-2012","Kleinen-von Konigslow, Katharina/0000-0001-7700-9829",,,,,73,10,10,2,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

In this paper, we focus on the U.S. case and present findings from interviews with 17 former social media firm employees (n = 7) and political practitioners (n = 11). We also analyze emails (n = 45) exchanged between Facebook government and elections staffers and two campaigns, a U.S. gubernatorial (2017) and presidential campaign (2016), regarding the platform's policies in the context of paid speech. In addressing questions about Facebook's and Google's processes and policies regarding paid political content, the rationales for them, and the ability of campaigns to contest decisions, this study shows how while Facebook and Google resist being arbiters of political discourse, they actively vet paid content on their platforms. These platforms differ with respect to how and what decisions they make in the context of paid speech and within each company there are active and ongoing debates among staffers about speech. These debates at times take place in consultation with political practitioners and often occur in the context of external events. Across these firms, policies regarding speech evolve through these internal debates, appeals by practitioners, and outside pressure. At the same time, both Facebook and Google make decisions in often opaque ways, according to policies that are not transparent, and without clear justifications to campaigns or the public as to how they are applied or enforced. This limits options for political practitioners to contest regulation decisions.

There is as yet no standard method for the unsupervised inductive identification of frames based upon the content of articles. Three groups of core approaches underlie a wide range of work in this area, and we compare three techniques based on these approaches against each other and against manual human analysts. The three techniques are a k-means clustering algorithm together with a sophisticated natural language processing (NLP)-based feature selection process; evolutionary factor analysis (EFA), a factor analysis approach; and the structural topic model (STM). We use two datasets - one very focused and one extremely broad - as examples of the kind of frame analysis problems readers may wish to attempt. Even in a highly targeted dataset, we find some distance between the frames generated by computational analysis and those manually produced by our human analysts. The details of each method have a substantial impact on frame quality and interpretation. We find that the STM approach is the most effective for our narrow-scope dataset, but that it returns definite topics, and not frames, when working on our very broad dataset. We also show that we can get results emphasizing different parts of the framing problem by combining parts of different methods as a multi-stage process, rather than viewing available methods as simple plug-and-play models.","[Nicholls, Tom] Univ Oxford, Blavatnik Sch Govt, Oxford OX2 6GG, England; [Culpepper, Pepper D.] Univ Oxford, Blavatnik Sch Govt, Acad Affairs, Oxford, England; [Culpepper, Pepper D.] Univ Oxford, Blavatnik Sch Govt, Govt & Publ Policy, Oxford, England",,"Nicholls, T (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Blavatnik Sch Govt, Oxford OX2 6GG, England.",tom.nicholls@bsg.ox.ac.uk,,"Culpepper, Pepper/0000-0001-6227-0813; Nicholls, Tom/0000-0002-6971-8614",European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union [787887],European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union(European Research Council (ERC)),This project has received funding from the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme (grant agreement No 787887).

One promising approach for coping with this missing data is to find the true values of the missing covariates for a subset of the observations and then train a machine learning algorithm to predict the values of those covariates for the rest. However, plugging in these predictions without regard for prediction error renders regression analyses biased, inconsistent, and overconfident.

Such models require costly manual labeling of documents. In this paper, we introduce active learning, a framework in which data to be labeled by human coders are not chosen at random but rather targeted in such a way that the required amount of data to train a machine learning model can be minimized. We study the benefits of active learning using text data examples. We perform simulation studies that illustrate conditions where active learning can reduce the cost of labeling text data. We perform these simulations on three corpora that vary in size, document length, and domain. We find that in cases where the document class of interest is not balanced, researchers can label a fraction of the documents one would need using random sampling (or passive learning) to achieve equally performing classifiers. We further investigate how varying levels of intercoder reliability affect the active learning procedures and find that even with low reliability, active learning performs more efficiently than does random sampling.","[Miller, Blake] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Methodol, Columbia House,Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Linder, Fridolin] NYU, Dept Polit Sci, Social Media & Polit Participat Lab, 431 19 West 4th St, New York, NY 10012 USA; [Mebane, Walter R., Jr.] Univ Michigan, Dept Polit Sci, Haven Hall, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Mebane, Walter R., Jr.] Univ Michigan, Dept Stat, Haven Hall, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",,"Miller, B (corresponding author), London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Methodol, Columbia House,Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",b.a.miller@lse.ac.uk; fridolin.linder@nyu.edu; wmebane@umich.edu,,"Miller, Blake/0000-0002-4707-0984",NSF [SES 1523355],NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)),Work supported by NSF award SES 1523355.,,49,11,11,9,22,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1047-1987,1476-4989,,POLIT ANAL,Polit.

Using real-world data, we illustrate how our mechanism could be applied to the assignment of refugee families to host country locations, and kindergarteners to schools. Our mechanism allows a planner to first specify a threshold g for the minimum acceptable average outcome score that should be achieved by the assignment. In the refugee matching context, this score corresponds to the probability of employment, whereas in the student assignment context, it corresponds to standardized test scores. The mechanism is a priority mechanism that considers both outcomes and preferences by assigning agents (refugee families and students) based on their preferences, but subject to meeting the planner's specified threshold. The mechanism is both strategy-proof and constrained efficient in that it always generates a matching that is not Pareto dominated by any other matching that respects the planner's threshold.","[Acharya, Avidit; Hainmueller, Jens] Stanford Univ, Dept Polit Sci, 616 Serra St Encina Hall West,Room 100, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Bansak, Kirk] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Polit Sci, 9500 Gilman Dr, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA",,"Acharya, A (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Dept Polit Sci, 616 Serra St Encina Hall West,Room 100, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",avidit@stanford.edu; kbansak@ucsd.edu; jhain@stanford.edu,,"Hainmueller, Jens/0000-0001-8214-9041",Rockefeller Foundation; Schmidt Futures; Stanford AI Lab; Stanford Graduate School of Business; Stanford School of Medicine,Rockefeller Foundation; Schmidt Futures; Stanford AI Lab; Stanford Graduate School of Business; Stanford School of Medicine,"We acknowledge funding from the Rockefeller Foundation, Schmidt Futures, and the 2018 HAI seed grant program from the Stanford AI Lab, Stanford School of Medicine, and Stanford Graduate School of Business.

Here, we propose a method to derive a score of parties' levels of populism using supervised machine learning to perform textual analysis on national manifestos. We illustrate the advantages of our approach, which allows for measuring populism for a vast number of parties and countries without resource-intensive human-coding processes and provides accurate, updated information for temporal and spatial comparisons of populism. Furthermore, our method allows for obtaining a continuous score of populism, which ensures more fine-grained analyses of the party landscape while reducing the risk of arbitrary classifications. To illustrate the potential contribution of this score, we use it as a proxy for parties' levels of populism, analyzing average trends in six European countries from the early 2000s for nearly two decades.","[Di Cocco, Jessica] Sapienza Univ, Dept Econ, Via Castro Laurenziano 19, I-00161 Rome, Italy; [Monechi, Bernardo] Sony Comp Sci Labs, 6 Rue Amyot, F-75005 Paris, France",,"Di Cocco, J (corresponding author), Sapienza Univ, Dept Econ, Via Castro Laurenziano 19, I-00161 Rome, Italy.",jessica.dicocco@uniroma1.it,,"Di Cocco, Jessica/0000-0001-8355-6730",,,,,70,0,0,2,2,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1047-1987,1476-4989,,POLIT ANAL,Polit.

Yet one important question that persists within the fields of political science, communication, and psychology is whether appearance or substance matters more during political campaigns. To a large extent, this appearance vs. substance question remains open and, crucially, the notion that appearance can in fact effectively sway voter perceptions is consequential for the health of democracy. This study leverages advances from the fields of machine learning and computer vision to expand our knowledge on how nonverbal elements of political communication influence voters immediate impressions of political actors. We rely on video from the 4th Republican Party presidential debate held on November 10, 2016, as well as continuous response approval data from a live focus group (n = 311; 36,528 reactions), to determine how the emotional displays of political candidates influence voter impression formation. Our results suggest that anger displays can positively influence viewers' real-time evaluations. Happiness displays, on the other hand, are much less effective in eliciting a response from the viewing public, while fear displays were rarely projected by the candidates of the debate under study.","[Boussalis, Constantine; Coan, Travis G.] Trinity Coll Dublin, Dept Polit Sci, Dublin, Ireland; [Boussalis, Constantine; Coan, Travis G.] Univ Exeter, Polit Dept, Exeter, Devon, England; [Boussalis, Constantine; Coan, Travis G.] Exeter Q Step Ctr, Exeter, Devon, England; [Boussalis, Constantine; Coan, Travis G.] Trinity Coll Dublin, Dept Polit Sci, 3 Coll Green, Dublin 2, Ireland",,"Boussalis, C (corresponding author), Trinity Coll Dublin, Dept Polit Sci, 3 Coll Green, Dublin 2, Ireland.",boussalc@tcd.ie,"Boussalis, Constantine/AAC-5373-2022",,Trinity College Dublin [Arts and Social Sciences Benefactions Fund] [2018-19]; UK Economic and Social Research Council [ES/N012283/1],Trinity College Dublin [Arts and Social Sciences Benefactions Fund]; UK Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),This work was supported by the Trinity College Dublin [Arts and Social Sciences Benefactions Fund 2018-19].

Based on this, we discuss several computational approaches to empirically detect such news events in large corpora of news coverage in an unsupervised manner. We provide two approaches: One based on traditional tf center dot idf based cosine similarities, and one that relies on word embeddings, in particular the softcosine measure. Both methods, combined with a network clustering algorithm, perform very well in detecting news events.

We show that the within-country variation of topics is a good predictor of conflict and becomes particularly useful when risk in previously peaceful countries arises.

But political scientists are often interested in how effects vary across subpopulations-heterogeneous treatment effects-and how differences in the content of the treatment affects responses-the response to heterogeneous treatments. Several new methods have been introduced to estimate heterogeneous effects, but it is difficult to know if a method will perform well for a particular data set. Rather than using only one method, we show how an ensemble of methods-weighted averages of estimates from individual models increasingly used in machine learning-accurately measure heterogeneous effects. Building on a large literature on ensemble methods, we show how the weighting of methods can contribute to accurate estimation of heterogeneous treatment effects and demonstrate how pooling models lead to superior performance to individual methods across diverse problems. We apply the ensemble method to two experiments, illuminating how the ensemble method for heterogeneous treatment effects facilitates exploratory analysis of treatment effects.","[Grimmer, Justin] Univ Chicago, Dept Polit Sci, 5828 S Univ Ave, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Messing, Solomon] Data Labs, Pew Res Ctr, 1615 L St NW, Washington, DC USA; [Westwood, Sean J.] Dartmouth Coll, Dept Govt, Hanover, NH 03755 USA",,"Grimmer, J (corresponding author), Univ Chicago, Dept Polit Sci, 5828 S Univ Ave, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",jgrimmer@stanford.edu,,,,,,,40,37,37,3,18,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1047-1987,1476-4989,,POLIT ANAL,Polit.

The consequences of this practice, which occurs in over two-thirds of recent computational work in political science, are underappreciated. Imperfect proxies can reflect noise and contamination from other concepts, producing biased point estimates and standard errors. We demonstrate how analysts can use causal diagrams to articulate theoretical concepts and their relationships to estimated proxies, then apply straightforward rules to assess which conclusions are rigorously supportable. We formalize and extend common heuristics for signing the bias-a technique for reasoning about unobserved confounding-to scenarios with imperfect proxies. Using these tools, we demonstrate how, in often-encountered research settings, proxy-based analyses allow for valid tests for the existence and direction of theorized effects. We conclude with best-practice recommendations for the rapidly growing literature using learned proxies to test causal theories.","[Knox, Dean] Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Operat Informat & Decis Dept & Analyt Wharton, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Lucas, Christopher] Washington Univ, Dept Polit Sci, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; [Lucas, Christopher] Washington Univ, Div Computat & Data Sci, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; [Cho, Wendy K.

We propose an accurate, fast, and scalable approach to multiple imputation, which we call MIDAS (Multiple Imputation with Denoising Autoencoders). MIDAS employs a class of unsupervised neural networks known as denoising autoencoders, which are designed to reduce dimensionality by corrupting and attempting to reconstruct a subset of data. We repurpose denoising autoencoders for multiple imputation by treating missing values as an additional portion of corrupted data and drawing imputations from a model trained to minimize the reconstruction error on the originally observed portion. Systematic tests on simulated as well as real social science data, together with an applied example involving a large-scale electoral survey, illustrate MIDAS's accuracy and efficiency across a range of settings. We provide open-source software for implementing MIDAS.","[Lall, Ranjit] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Int Relat, London, England; [Robinson, Thomas] Univ Durham, Sch Govt & Int Affairs, Durham, England",,"Lall, R (corresponding author), London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Int Relat, London, England.",r.lall@lse.ac.uk; thomas.robinson@durham.ac.uk,,"Robinson, Thomas/0000-0001-7097-1599; Lall, Ranjit/0000-0003-1455-3506",,,,,20,0,0,6,6,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1047-1987,1476-4989,,POLIT ANAL,Polit.

Using a corpus of hundreds of thousands of headline A/B tests run by hundreds of news publishers, we develop and evaluate a machine-learned model to predict headline testing outcomes. We find that the model exhibits modest performance above baseline and further estimate an empirical upper bound for such content-based prediction in this domain, indicating an important role for non-content-based factors in test outcomes. Together, these results suggest that any particular headline writing approach has only a marginal impact, and that understanding reader behavior and headline context are key to predicting news attention decisions.","[Hagar, Nick; Diakopoulos, Nicholas] Northwestern Univ, Commun Studies, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [DeWilde, Burton] Chartbeat Inc, New York, NY USA",,"Diakopoulos, N (corresponding author), Northwestern Univ, Commun Studies, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",nad@northwestern.edu,,"Hagar, Nick/0000-0001-5110-3737; Diakopoulos, Nicholas/0000-0001-5005-6123",National Science Foundation Grant [IIS-1717330],National Science Foundation Grant(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"This work is supported by the National Science Foundation Grant, award IIS-1717330.",,69,0,0,3,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

But so far only a few investigative stories have utilized AI methods, in relatively narrow ways. This paper surveys what has been accomplished in investigative reporting using AI techniques, why it has been difficult to apply more advanced methods, and what sorts of investigative journalism problems might be solved by AI in the near term. Journalism problems are often unique to a particular story, which means that training data is not readily available and the cost of complex models cannot be amortized over multiple projects. Much of the data relevant to a story is not publicly accessible but in the hands of governments and private entities, often requiring collection, negotiation, or purchase. Journalistic inference requires very high accuracy, or extensive manual checking, to avoid the risk of libel. The factors that make some set of facts newsworthy are deeply sociopolitical and therefore difficult to encode computationally. The biggest near-term potential for AI in investigative journalism lies in data preparation tasks, such as data extraction from diverse documents and probabilistic cross-database record linkage.","[Stray, Jonathan] Columbia Univ, Grad Sch Journalism, New York, NY 10027 USA",,"Stray, J (corresponding author), Columbia Univ, Grad Sch Journalism, New York, NY 10027 USA.",jonathan.stray@columbia.edu,,"Stray, Jonathan/0000-0003-4467-1239",,,,,63,22,26,13,65,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

Du Bois 2014; Tantucci et al. 2018), naturalistic interaction is inherently grounded in resonance, viz. the catalytic activation of affinities across turns (Du Bois and Giora 2014). Resonance occurs dynamically when interlocutors creatively coconstruct utterances that are formally and phonetically similar to the utterance of a prior speaker. In this study, we argue that such similarity can inform the machine learning prediction of linguistic and crosscultural diversity. We compared two sets of 1,000 exchanges involving (dis)agreement from the two balanced Callhome corpora of naturalistic interaction in Mandarin Chinese and American English. We found a correlation of overt use of pragmatic markers with resonance, indicating that priming does not occur as an exclusively implicit mechanism (as it is commonly held in the experimental literature e.g. Bock 1986; Bock et al. 2007), but naturalistically underpins dialogic engagement and cooperation among interactants. We fitted a mixed effects linear regression and a hierarchical clustering model to show that resonance occurs formally and functionally in different ways from one language to another. The applied results of this study can lead to a novel turn in AI research of conversational interfaces (McTear et al. 2016; Klopfenstein et al. 2017), as they reveal the fundamental role played cross-linguistically by resonance as a form of engagement of human-to-human interaction and the importance to address this mechanism in machine-to-human communication.","[Tantucci, Vittorio] Univ Lancaster, Dept Linguist & English Language, Lancaster, England; [Wang, Aiqing] Univ Lancaster, Dept Languages & Cultures, Lancaster, England",,"Tantucci, V (corresponding author), Univ Lancaster, Dept Linguist & English Language, Lancaster, England.",v.tantucci@lancaster.ac.uk,,,,,,,168,3,3,0,0,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0142-6001,1477-450X,,APPL LINGUIST,Appl.

In the U.S. Senate, we estimate a dimension that has moderate within-party correlations with scales based on roll-call votes and campaign donation patterns; however, we observe greater overlap across parties in speech positions than roll-call positions and partisan polarization in speeches varies more clearly in response to major political events.","[Lauderdale, Benjamin E.] London Sch Econ, Dept Methodol, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Herzog, Alexander] Clemson Univ, Sch Comp, Clemson, SC 29634 USA",,"Lauderdale, BE (corresponding author), London Sch Econ, Dept Methodol, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",b.e.lauderdale@lse.ac.uk; aherzog@clemson.edu,,"Lauderdale, Benjamin/0000-0003-3090-0969",,,,,51,56,60,1,21,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1047-1987,1476-4989,,POLIT ANAL,Polit.

The present study aims to examine the issue from a diachronic perspective, and it is probably the first one that employed a mixed method of both a small lexicon analysis and sentiment analysis in this line of research. Specifically, a series of experiments were performed based on a corpus of 775,460 abstracts published between 1969 and 2019 in 123 scientific journals covering 12 research disciplines in life sciences. The results demonstrated a linguistic positivity bias in academic writing. More importantly, a significant upward trend of linguistic positivity bias was observed over the past 5 decades. Major communicative functions of positive and negative sentences are also analysed. Reasons for this linguistic positivity bias are explored from the perspectives of publication pressure/bias, employment of linguistic devices to promote research, and language use for political correctness purposes. Lastly, implications for authors and learners of academic writing and for researchers of sentiment analysis are also discussed.","[Wen, Ju] Chongqing Univ, Sch Foreign Languages & Cultures, Chongqing, Peoples R China; [Lei, Lei] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Foreign Languages, Shanghai, Peoples R China",,"Lei, L (corresponding author), Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Foreign Languages, Shanghai, Peoples R China.",leileicn@126.com,,"Wen, Ju/0000-0002-6778-5098; Lei, Lei/0000-0002-3366-1855",Social Science Fund of Sichuan Province [SC20WY023]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of Chongqing University [2021CDJSKZX10]; National Natural Science Foundation Project of CQ CSTC [cstc2020jcyjmsxmX0554],Social Science Fund of Sichuan Province; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of Chongqing University; National Natural Science Foundation Project of CQ CSTC(Natural Science Foundation Project of CQ CSTC),"The research is supported by the Social Science Fund of Sichuan Province (No.: SC20WY023), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of Chongqing University (NO.: 2021CDJSKZX10) and the National Natural Science Foundation Project of CQ CSTC (No.: cstc2020jcyjmsxmX0554).",,81,1,1,22,22,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0142-6001,1477-450X,,APPL LINGUIST,Appl.

However, only a minority of voters believe that politicians try to keep their promises, and many voters struggle to recall the fulfillment or breaking of salient campaign pledges accurately. I argue that this disparity between the public perception and empirical evidence is influenced by the information voters receive throughout the electoral cycle. I expect that the media extensively inform readers about political promises. In addition, I posit that news outlets focus more on broken than on fulfilled promises and that the focus on broken promises has increased over time. I find strong support for these expectations based on a new text corpus of over 430,000 statements on political commitments published between 1979 and 2017 in 22 newspapers during 33 electoral cycles in Australia, Canada, Ireland, and the United Kingdom. Newspapers inform voters regularly about announced, broken, and fulfilled promises. Yet, across the four countries, newspapers report at least twice as much on broken than on fulfilled promises. Moreover, this negativity bias in reports on political promises has increased substantively. The results have implications for studying campaign promises, negative information in mass media, and the linkages between voters and parties.","[Mueller, Stefan] Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Polit & Int Relat, Newman Bldg, Dublin 4, Ireland",,"Muller, S (corresponding author), Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Polit & Int Relat, Newman Bldg, Dublin 4, Ireland.",stefan.mueller@ucd.ie,,"Muller, Stefan/0000-0002-6315-4125",Irish Research Council (IRC) Government of Ireland Postgraduate Scholarship [GOIPG/2016/1278],Irish Research Council (IRC) Government of Ireland Postgraduate Scholarship,Stefan Muller received financial support from an Irish Research Council (IRC) Government of Ireland Postgraduate Scholarship [Grant no: GOIPG/2016/1278].,,81,8,8,0,8,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1058-4609,1091-7675,,POLIT COMMUN,Polit.

A potential mechanism that may reverse this trend is independent fact-checking to adjudicate competing claims in news stories. We undertake a survey experiment on a sample of 1608 Australians to test the effects of fact-checking on media trust using a real-life case study known as the sports rorts affair. We construct duplicate news articles from two national media outlets (i.e. ABC.net.au , news.com.au ) containing a senior government minister's real-life false claim that public funds were not used for political advantage immediately before an election. Half of the participants are exposed to a third-party fact check, which confirms the Minister's claim is verifiably false, the other half are not. All respondents are asked to evaluate the story's and news outlets' trustworthiness. Contrary to our expectations we find a backfire effect whereby independent fact-checking decreases readers' trust in the original news story and outlet. This negative relationship is not conditional on partisanship or the media source. Our study provides a cautionary tale for those expecting third-party fact-checks to increase media trust and we outline several avenues by which fact-checkers might overcome this.","[Carson, Andrea] La Trobe Univ, Dept Polit Media & Philosophy, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Gibbons, Andrew] Univ Texas Austin, Edward A Clark Ctr Australian & New Zealand Studi, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Martin, Aaron] Univ Melbourne, Sch Social & Polit Sci, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Phillips, Justin B.] Univ Waikato, Sch Social Sci, Hamilton, New Zealand",,"Carson, A (corresponding author), La Trobe Univ, Dept Polit Media & Philosophy, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.",a.carson@latrobe.edu.au,"Carson, Andrea/AAH-2320-2019","Carson, Andrea/0000-0001-5503-3334; Gibbons, Andrew/0000-0001-7175-7770; Phillips, Justin Bonest/0000-0002-2984-4472","La Trobe University; University of Melbourne, Policy Lab, Faculty of Arts","La Trobe University; University of Melbourne, Policy Lab, Faculty of Arts","The study was funded by La Trobe University academic start-up grant and University of Melbourne, Policy Lab, Faculty of Arts.",,57,1,1,4,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

Drawing on role congruity expectations, we study how the use of and reactions to facial, vocal, and textual communication in political debates varies by candidate gender. Relying on full-length videos of four German federal election debates (2005-2017) and a minor party debate, we use video, audio, and text data to measure candidate facial displays of emotion, vocal pitch, and speech sentiment. Consistent with our expectations, Angela Merkel expresses less anger than her male opponents, but she is just as emotive in other respects. Combining these measures of emotional expression with continuous responses recorded by live audiences, we find that voters punish Merkel for anger displays and reward her happiness and general emotional displays.","[Boussalis, Constantine] Trinity Coll Dublin, Dept Polit Sci, Dublin, Ireland; [Coan, Travis G.] Univ Exeter, Dept Polit, Exeter, Devon, England; [Coan, Travis G.] Univ Exeter, Exeter Q Step Ctr, Exeter, Devon, England; [Holman, Mirya R.] Tulane Univ, Dept Polit Sci, New Orleans, LA 70118 USA; [Muller, Stefan] Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Polit & Int Relat, Dublin, Ireland",,"Boussalis, C (corresponding author), Trinity Coll Dublin, Dept Polit Sci, Dublin, Ireland.",boussalc@tcd.ie; t.coan@exeter.ac.uk; mholman@tulane.edu; stefen.mueller@ucd.ie,"Holman, Mirya/I-6647-2016; Boussalis, Constantine/AAC-5373-2022","Holman, Mirya/0000-0001-6648-4122; Muller, Stefan/0000-0002-6315-4125; Boussalis, Constantine/0000-0002-0609-6272","Trinity College Dublin Arts and Social Sciences Benefactions Fund 2019-20; University College Dublin Ad Astra Start Up Grant; Dunbar Fund, Political Science, Tulane University","Trinity College Dublin Arts and Social Sciences Benefactions Fund 2019-20; University College Dublin Ad Astra Start Up Grant; Dunbar Fund, Political Science, Tulane University","This research was funded through generous support from the Trinity College Dublin Arts and Social Sciences Benefactions Fund 2019-20, from the University College Dublin Ad Astra Start Up Grant, and from the Dunbar Fund, Political Science, Tulane University.",,89,3,3,2,2,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0003-0554,1537-5943,,AM POLIT SCI REV,Am.

In this approach, an algorithm learns to classify topics in a labeled source corpus and then extrapolates topics in an unlabeled target corpus from another domain. The ability to use existing training data makes this method significantly more efficient than within-domain supervised learning. It also has three advantages over unsupervised topic models: the method can be more specifically targeted to a research question and the resulting topics are easier to validate and interpret. We demonstrate the method using the case of labeled party platforms (source corpus) and unlabeled parliamentary speeches (target corpus). In addition to the standard within-domain error metrics, we further validate the cross-domain performance by labeling a subset of target-corpus documents. We find that the classifier accurately assigns topics in the parliamentary speeches, although accuracy varies substantially by topic. We also propose tools diagnosing cross-domain classification. To illustrate the usefulness of the method, we present two case studies on how electoral rules and the gender of parliamentarians influence the choice of speech topics.","[Osnabruegge, Moritz] Univ Durham, Sch Govt & Int Affairs, Durham, England; [Ash, Elliott] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Ctr Law & Econ, Zurich, Switzerland; [Morelli, Massimo] Bocconi Univ, Dept Social & Polit Sci, Milan, Italy",,"Osnabrugge, M (corresponding author), Univ Durham, Sch Govt & Int Affairs, Durham, England.",moritz.osnabruegge@durham.ac.uk; ashe@ethz.ch; massimo.morelli@unibocconi.it,,"Osnabrugge, Moritz/0000-0002-6177-1111",European Research Council [694583],European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC)European Commission),This work was supported by the European Research Council (advanced grant 694583).,,46,3,3,6,6,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1047-1987,1476-4989,,POLIT ANAL,Polit.

The digitization of legislative transcripts has increased the potential application of established tools for the automated analyses of emotion in text. Unlike in writing, however, expressing emotion in speech involves intonation, facial expressions, and body lan- guage. Drawing on a new dataset of annotated texts and videos from the Canadian House of Commons, this paper does three things. First, we examine whether transcripts capture the emotional content of speeches. We find that transcripts capture sentiment, but not emotional arousal. Second, we compare strategies for the automated analysis of sentiment in text. We find that leading approaches performed reasonably well, but sentiment dictionaries generated using word embeddings surpassed these other approaches. Finally, we test the robustness of the approach based on word embeddings. Although the methodology is reasonably robust to alternative specifications, we find that dictionaries created using word embeddings are sensitive to the choice of seed words and to training corpus size. We conclude by discussing the implications for analyses of political speech.","[Cochrane, Christopher; Rheault, Ludovic; Whyte, Tanya; Wong, Michael W-C; Borwein, Sophie] Univ Toronto, Dept Polit Sci, Sidney Smith Hall,100 St George St, Toronto, ON M5S 3G3, Canada; [Godbout, Jean-Francois] Univ Montreal, Dept Polit Sci, Montreal, PQ, Canada",,"Cochrane, C (corresponding author), Univ Toronto, Dept Polit Sci, Sidney Smith Hall,100 St George St, Toronto, ON M5S 3G3, Canada.",christopher.cochrane@utoronto.ca,,"Rheault, Ludovic/0000-0002-9599-0427",Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada,Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),This research was funded by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada.,,91,0,0,10,20,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1058-4609,1091-7675,,POLIT COMMUN,Polit.

This seems to be due to the absence of flexible and cost-efficient methods that can be used to analyze documents in different domains and languages. Aiming to solve this problem, this paper proposes a semisupervised document scaling technique, called Latent Semantic Scaling (LSS), which can locate documents on various pre-defined dimensions. LSS achieves this by combining user-provided seed words and latent semantic analysis (word embedding). The article demonstrates its flexibility and efficiency in large-scale sentiment analysis of New York Times articles on the economy and Asahi Shimbun articles on politics. These examples show that LSS can produce results comparable to that of the Lexicoder Sentiment Dictionary (LSD) in both English and Japanese with only small sets of sentiment seed words. A new heuristic method that assists LSS users to choose a near-optimal number of singular values to obtain word vectors that best capture differences between documents on target dimensions is also presented.","[Watanabe, Kohei] Univ Innsbruck, Dept Polit Sci, Innsbruck, Austria",,"Watanabe, K (corresponding author), Dept Polit Sci, Room 2-44,Univ Str 15,2nd Floor, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria.",watanabe.kohei@gmail.com,,"Watanabe, Kohei/0000-0001-6519-5265",JSPS KAKENHI [JP19H01450]; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [JP19H01450],"JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Japan Society for the Promotion of Science(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science)",This study is conducted as part of a project supported by JSPS KAKENHI Grant Number JP19H01450;Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [JP19H01450];,,62,9,9,4,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1931-2458,1931-2466,,COMMUN METHODS MEAS,Commun.

Even though previous research suggests that information about politicians in traditional and new media can provide content that makes stereotypes based on gender and party, little is known about the presence of such bias in search engines, which function as information gatekeepers in the digital age. Using quantitative text analysis and human coding techniques on a novel data set of members of the German parliament, this study examines whether search engine suggestions, i.e. search predictions, for politicians differ with respect to personal and role-oriented information based on the gender and party of the politician. It also explores whether the search engine representation of politicians changes around elections. The study further compares gender and party differences in search engine results with corresponding Wikipedia articles of the same politicians, as users are most often redirected to Wikipedia from Google. The results suggest that politicians' representation in search engines and Wikipedia are structured by a joint effect of their gender and party identity. While Google suggestions provide less personal information about female politicians belonging to a right-wing party compared to their male counterparts, this relationship is not observable for left-wing parties. Moreover, there are changes in gender biases around the election. In Wikipedia articles, politicians belonging to right-wing parties are represented with more personal information compared to politicians belonging to left ones, an effect which is even stronger for females.","[Pradel, Franziska] Univ Cologne, Cologne Ctr Comparat Polit, D-50923 Cologne, Germany",,"Pradel, F (corresponding author), Univ Cologne, Cologne Ctr Comparat Polit, D-50923 Cologne, Germany.",pradel@wiso.uni-koeln.de,,"Pradel, Franziska/0000-0003-4559-0772",Digital Society research program - Ministry of Culture and Science of the German State of North Rhine-Westphalia,Digital Society research program - Ministry of Culture and Science of the German State of North Rhine-Westphalia,"This research was supported by the Digital Society research program funded by the Ministry of Culture and Science of the German State of North Rhine-Westphalia.

Despite a few studies in political science, the potential of this methodology for the analysis of political texts has yet to be fully uncovered. This paper introduces models of word embeddings augmented with political metadata and trained on large-scale parliamentary corpora from Britain, Canada, and the United States. We fit these models with indicator variables of the party affiliation of members of parliament, which we refer to as party embeddings. We illustrate how these embeddings can be used to produce scaling estimates of ideological placement and other quantities of interest for political research. To validate the methodology, we assess our results against indicators from the Comparative Manifestos Project, surveys of experts, and measures based on roll-call votes. Our findings suggest that party embeddings are successful at capturing latent concepts such as ideology, and the approach provides researchers with an integrated framework for studying political language.","[Rheault, Ludovic; Cochrane, Christopher] Univ Toronto, Dept Polit Sci, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Rheault, Ludovic] Univ Toronto, Munk Sch Global Affairs & Publ Policy, Toronto, ON, Canada",,"Rheault, L (corresponding author), Univ Toronto, Dept Polit Sci, Toronto, ON, Canada.;Rheault, L (corresponding author), Univ Toronto, Munk Sch Global Affairs & Publ Policy, Toronto, ON, Canada.",ludovic.rheault@utoronto.ca; christopher.cochrane@utoronto.ca,,"Rheault, Ludovic/0000-0002-9599-0427",,,,,64,17,18,4,19,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1047-1987,1476-4989,,POLIT ANAL,Polit.

Verbal attacks specifically provide leaders with a low-cost, easy to execute tool to delegitimize critical media. In this paper we present a theoretical contribution on when leaders in unconsolidated democracies verbally attack the media. Furthermore, we propose a way to quantitatively measure such attacks. Focusing on unconsolidated democracies, we argue that verbal attacks against independent media will increase when leaders face non-institutional ouster attempts like major protests and coups due to two reasons: 1) the surprise nature of these events, and 2) their disconnect to fully democratic means of staying in power. Our analysis examines verbal attacks on independent media by former Venezuelan president Hugo Ch?vez. We code 385 airings of Ch?vez?s weekly program Al? Presidente, from May 1999 to January 2012, counting verbal attacks against independent media. Using a Box-Tiao intervention model, we find Ch?vez?s verbal attacks against independent media significantly increased during non-institutional ouster efforts, such as major protests and the 2002 coup attempt. These findings show the degree to which elected leaders will go to discredit uncomfortable media outlets in unconsolidated democracies during uncertain political events.","[Solis, Jonathan A.] Coll William & Mary, Global Res Inst, AidData Res Lab, Williamsburg, VA USA; [Sagarzazu, Inaki] Univ Houston, Hobby Sch Publ Affairs, Houston, TX 77004 USA",,"Solis, JA (corresponding author), Coll William & Mary, Williamsburg, VA 23185 USA.",jsolis@aiddata.wm.edu,,"Solis, Jonathan/0000-0002-2570-7411",,,,,80,2,2,2,8,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1058-4609,1091-7675,,POLIT COMMUN,Polit.

Japanese EFL learners (N=279) were divided into three lexical proficiency groups, and their ability to comprehend inflectional and derivational English forms was measured with an English to Japanese translation test. A significant difference among the participants' ability to comprehend 12 base forms, associated inflected forms, and associated derived forms was found across the three proficiency groups, and even among participants who demonstrated mastery of the first 4,000 or 5,000 base forms of English. The flemma, a word's base form and associated inflectional forms, was found to be an appropriate word counting unit for most participants. Results are important because corpus research findings demonstrate that in cases where the word family provides 98 per cent coverage of texts, the flemma only provides 85 per cent coverage of the same texts. Thus, considering the detrimental impact to reading comprehension from only small decreases in the percentage of known tokens within a text, the results question the inferences made in word family-based research.","[McLean, Stuart] Osaka Jogakuin Univ, Osaka, Japan; [McLean, Stuart] Kansai Univ, Grad Sch Foreign Language Educ & Res, Suita, Osaka, Japan",,"McLean, S (corresponding author), Osaka Jogakuin Univ, Osaka, Japan.;McLean, S (corresponding author), Kansai Univ, Grad Sch Foreign Language Educ & Res, Suita, Osaka, Japan.",stuart93@me.com,,,JSPS KAKENHI [JP 16K16890],"JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",This work was supported by JSPS KAKENHI (grant number JP 16K16890).,,39,29,29,1,22,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0142-6001,1477-450X,,APPL LINGUIST,Appl.

It addresses the long-term decline in trust and potential causes for this decline, with an emphasis on the effects of partisanship, polarization, performance, process, and media priming. While dispositions can anchor trust levels, the dominant research findings show that the sources of variation and change in trust are political, if multifaceted, in nature. We discuss new versions of standard measures, call for a renewed look at the distinction between trust in authorities and trust in the regime, review ongoing work on how and why trust matters, and recommend broadening the foci of mistrust to include antiestablishment sentiments and attacks on electoral integrity. How trust intervenes between perceptions of political processes and compliance with authoritative commands is a critical domain for additional research. We conclude with a caveat against confidence that the decline in trust can be quickly or easily reversed.","[Citrin, Jack; Stoker, Laura] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Polit Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",,"Citrin, J (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Polit Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",gojack@berkeley.edu; stoker@berkeley.edu,,,,,,,159,100,102,35,118,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1094-2939,,,ANNU REV POLIT SCI,Annu.

In contrast to previous studies, disciplinary categories are not assumed at the outset of the analysis, but rather emerge from an initial analysis of variation across all writers in the corpus. Variation is presented in the form of a visual map representing degrees of similarity and difference between individual writers. Emergent disciplinary groupings are then used as the basis for a qualitative analysis of distinctive lexical bundles. Analysis reveals four main disciplinary groupings. A primary distinction appears between hard (science/technology) and soft (humanities/social sciences) subjects, with two further groupings (life sciences and commerce) being intermediate between these two. Evidence is also found of cross-group disciplines, which draw on a variety of influences, and of particular disciplines which are internally heterogeneous.

The content of these predicates can be analyzed using existing frequency-based methods, allowing for the analysis of actions, issue positions and framing by different actors within a single text. We show that a small set of syntactic patterns can extract clauses and identify quotes with good accuracy, significantly outperforming a baseline system based on word order.

We compiled, mapped, and analyzed a set of 9,757 stories published over 16 months relevant to the Combating Online Infringement and Counterfeits Act (COICA), Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA), and PROTECT IP Act (PIPA). This study applies a mixed-methods approach that combines text and link analysis with human coding and informal interviews to map the evolution of the controversy over time and to analyze the mobilization, roles, and interactions of various actors. We find a vibrant, diverse, and decentralized networked public sphere that exhibited broad participation, leveraged topical expertise, and successfully reframed a debate and focused public sentiment to shape national public policy. A network of small-scale commercial tech media, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), and individuals fulfilled the fourth estate function; traditional media then amplified the work of these actors. The campaign involved substantial experimentation and rapid development of mobilization strategies. We observe an increased public awareness of an agenda originating in the networked public sphere, which emerged successfully despite substantial expenditures attempting to produce a mass media narrative that favored the legislation. Moreover, we witness what we call an attention backbone, in which more trafficked sites amplify less-visible individual voices on specific subjects. The data suggest that, at least in this case, the networked public sphere enabled a dynamic public discourse that involved both individual and organizational participants and offered substantive discussion of complex issues contributing to affirmative political action.","[Benkler, Yochai] Harvard Univ, Sch Law, Entrepreneurial Legal Studies, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Benkler, Yochai; Roberts, Hal; Faris, Robert; Solow-Niederman, Alicia] Harvard Univ, Berkman Ctr Internet & Soc, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Etling, Bruce] Harvard Univ, Berkman Ctr Internet & Soc, Internet & Democracy Project, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",,"Benkler, Y (corresponding author), Harvard Univ, Berkman Ctr Internet & Soc, 23 Everett St,2nd Floor, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",ybenkler@law.harvard.edu,,,Ford Foundation; Open Society Foundation,Ford Foundation; Open Society Foundation,We are grateful to the Ford Foundation and the Open Society Foundation for their generous support of this research and the Media Cloud platform.,,77,58,58,2,52,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1058-4609,1091-7675,,POLIT COMMUN,Polit.

In particular, the study investigates the lexical overlap among the corpora in the top 3,000 words based on the average reduced frequency (ARF), which is a measure that takes into consideration both frequency and dispersion of lexical items. The results show that there exists a stable vocabulary core of 2,122 items (70.7%) among the four corpora. Moreover, these vocabulary items occur with comparable ranks in the individual wordlists. In producing the new-GSL, the core vocabulary items were combined with new items frequently occurring in the corpora representing current language use (BE06 and EnTenTen12).

We show that the language used to describe a ballot measure does indeed have the potential to affect election outcomes, including measures dealing with contentious social issues affecting individual rights. We also find, however, that exposing individuals to basic campaign information-in our case, endorsements from prominent interest groups-greatly attenuates the framing effects of ballot text.

The German words for yes and but share the same vowel at the word boundary: ja aber. Data from naturally occurring talk show that German speakers exploit this property of their language to differentiate between ja aber and jaber. The phonetic distinction co-occurs with a distinction in how actions are formatted. In ja aber turns, ja performs a separate action, often as a second pair part, providing an elicited confirming response. The action initiated by aber is typically disaffiliative and done for the first time. In contrast, jaber-fronted turns are rarely second pair parts and perform one single disaffiliative action, which is a redoing of a previously accomplished or attempted action. The frequent occurrence of jaber in the corpus suggests that the item is being used as a wordlike entity similar to a discourse marker. The findings reveal that for participants the local requirement to manage action boundaries is more relevant than linguistic word boundaries that may exist outside the interactional context. Data are in German with English translation.","[Reed, Beatrice Szczepek] Univ York, Dept Educ, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England",,"Reed, BS (corresponding author), Univ York, Dept Educ, Derwent Coll, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England.",beatrice.szczepek.reed@york.ac.uk,,"Szczepek Reed, Beatrice/0000-0002-3814-5198",,,,,44,11,11,1,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0835-1813,1532-7973,,RES LANG SOC INTERAC,Res.

Two metadiscourse dimensions, participants' interaction and discourse presentation, are identified. The more interactive registers are more prominently marked by participants' interaction, and the more informational registers by discourse presentation. Along metadiscourse dimensions, the 10 registers are lumped into 6 clusters: 'discussion broadcasts and public conversations', 'scripted speeches and unscripted speeches', 'general prose and nondiscussion broadcasts', 'press and fiction', 'casual conversations', and 'academic prose'. Metadiscourse markers of both dimensions are frequently used in registers of the first two clusters which are highly interactive and informational, while they rarely occur in registers of the next two clusters which have low interactive or informational focuses. Metadiscourse markers of participants' interaction are pervasive in the highly interactive register (casual conversations), and those of discourse presentation in the highly informational register (academic prose).","[Zhang, Man] Cent China Normal Univ, Sch Foreign Languages, Wuhan, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Man] Humboldt Univ, Fac Language Literature & Humanities, Berlin, Germany",,"Zhang, M (corresponding author), Cent China Normal Univ, Sch Foreign Languages, Wuhan, Peoples R China.",zm@ccnu.edu.cn,,,,,,,42,0,0,35,35,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0142-6001,1477-450X,,APPL LINGUIST,Appl.

Yet, they claim that such advocacy is central to their missions. I argue that interest groups representing women, people of color, Native nations, and the poor strategically conduct intersectional advocacy through coalitional lobbying. I test this claim using a new dataset of cosignature patterns within public comments on proposed federal agency rules submitted by a set of such groups between 2004 and 2014. I find that these groups are significantly more likely to pursue intersectional advocacy in coalitions but that coalition work, alone, does not relate to influential intersectional advocacy. Rather, it is particular coalition characteristics, including organizational diversity and financial capacity, that predict such influence. I conclude that collaborative lobbying is an effective tactic for mediating representational bias in interest group advocacy and promoting more pluralistic administrative policy making.","[Dwidar, Maraam A.] Syracuse Univ, Polit Sci, Maxwell Sch Citizenship & Publ Affairs, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA",,"Dwidar, MA (corresponding author), Syracuse Univ, Polit Sci, Maxwell Sch Citizenship & Publ Affairs, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA.",mdwidar@maxwell.syr.edu,,,J.J.

Despite a rich theoretical literature discussing reputation, we do not have a comparable measure across agencies, between countries, and over time. I present a new strategy to measure bureaucratic reputation from legislative speeches with word-embedding techniques. I introduce an original dataset on the reputation of 465 bureaucratic bodies over a period of 40 years, and across two countries-the U.S. and the U.K. I perform several validation tests and present an application of this method to investigate whether partisanship and agency politicization matter for reputation. I find that agencies enjoy a better reputation among the members of the party in government, with partisan differences less pronounced for independent bodies.

Does exposure to a crisis intensify rallying by fomenting nationalism, inciting hawkishness, and distracting from quotidian economic concerns? Or does exposure deepen dissatisfaction with the incumbent, thereby reducing a rallying effect? We argue the latter using evidence from a difficult test in India. A major pre-election terrorist attack boosted the nationwide popularity of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the nationalist ruling party. Yet we find that proximity to the victims' funeral processions, which served as patriotic rallies, substantially reduced BJP support where the party was incumbent. The size and breadth of our observed effects indicate that the social commemoration of the attack, rather than direct personal connections to its victims, fuelled anti-incumbent sentiment. Mobilizing collective anger after a crisis may dampen rather than augment a rally-around-the-flag effect.","[Hintson, Jamie] Stanford Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Encina Hall West,Suite 100, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Vaishnav, Milan] Carnegie Endowment Int Peace, South Asia Program, 1779 Massachusetts Ave, Washington, DC 20036 USA",,"Hintson, J (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Encina Hall West,Suite 100, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",jhintson@stanford.edu; mvaishnav@ceip.org,,,,,,,59,0,0,5,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0092-5853,1540-5907,,AM J POLIT SCI,Am.

Moving beyond two main concepts of 'interlingual' and 'intra-lingual' discrimination in applied linguistics, this article points out the concept of 'translingual discrimination', which refers to inequality based on transnational identities' specific linguistic repertoires and backgrounds that are substantiated by the national order of things. Translingual discrimination adds intensity to transnational processes, with the skilled migrants showing particular potential for exclusion regarding two factors: translingual 'name discrimination' and 'English discrimination'. 'Translingual name discrimination' is a homogenous form of 'name' policing, evident in multiple examples where the skilled transnational migrants' job applications are often largely rejected on the grounds of their 'birth name' written on their curriculum vitae. 'Translingual English discrimination' is another common form of discrimination, where the skilled transnational migrants become subject to discrimination based on their English proficiency and their overall language skills, leading to 'the paradoxes of migration'-discrepancies between the imagination and the reality-where they fall from 'hero to zero' in the host society.","[Dovchin, Sender; Dryden, Stephanie] Curtin Univ, Sch Educ, Bentley Campus, Perth, WA 6102, Australia",,"Dovchin, S (corresponding author), Curtin Univ, Sch Educ, Bentley Campus, Perth, WA 6102, Australia.",sender.dovchin@curtin.edu.au,,"Dryden, Stephanie/0000-0001-6765-7005; Dovchin, Sender/0000-0003-4327-7096",Australian Research Council [DE180100118]; Department of Home Affairs [4-AXFMHKT]; Australian Government Research Training Program (RTP) Scholarship,"Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); Department of Home Affairs; Australian Government Research Training Program (RTP) Scholarship(Australian GovernmentDepartment of Industry, Innovation and Science)","This research was supported by Australian Research Council (grant number DE180100118), the Department of Home Affairs (grant number 4-AXFMHKT) and the Australian Government Research Training Program (RTP) Scholarship.",,53,1,1,2,2,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0142-6001,1477-450X,,APPL LINGUIST,Appl.

Using a multimodal Conversation Analysis of two extended sequences of LP during mealtime conversations, this study analyzes how FLH participants deploy verbal and embodied resources to organize participation in LP. It then illustrates how these strategies dynamically orient to sociability and learning, thereby constructing a hybrid social-and-learning interactional space. As prior studies of LP and learning draw primarily from classroom dyadic conversations, this study sheds additional light on the role of LP in regulating multiparty social talk, with application to understanding the interactional organization of informal immersion-based language learning programs.","[Moody, Stephen J.] Brigham Young Univ, Asian & Near Eastern Languages, 3069 JFSB, Provo, UT 84602 USA; [Tsuchiya, Shinsuke] Brigham Young Univ, Asian & Near Eastern Languages, 3064A JFSB, Provo, UT 84602 USA",,"Moody, SJ (corresponding author), Brigham Young Univ, Asian & Near Eastern Languages, 3069 JFSB, Provo, UT 84602 USA.",sjmoody@byu.edu,,,,,,,38,0,0,2,6,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0142-6001,1477-450X,,APPL LINGUIST,Appl.

Yet vast literatures on political communication focus almost exclusively on what words were spoken, entirely ignoring how they were delivered-auditory cues that convey emotion, signal positions, and establish reputation. We develop a model that opens this information to principled statistical inquiry: the model of audio and speech structure (MASS). Our approach models political speech as a stochastic process shaped by fixed and time-varying covariates, including the history of the conversation itself. In an application to Supreme Court oral arguments, we demonstrate how vocal tone signals crucial information-skepticism of legal arguments-that is indecipherable to text models. Results show that justices do not use questioning to strategically manipulate their peers but rather engage sincerely with the presented arguments. Our easy-to-use R package, communication, implements the model and many more tools for audio analysis.","[Knox, Dean] Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Lucas, Christopher] Washington Univ, Dept Polit Sci, St Louis, MO 14263 USA",,"Knox, D (corresponding author), Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",dcknox@upenn.edu; christopher.lucas@wustl.edu,"Knox, Dean/AGF-3054-2022",/0000-0002-1945-7938,Analytics at Wharton; Schmidt DataX Fund at Princeton University; National Science Foundation [1122374]; Microsoft Research Computational Social Science postdoctoral researcher program,Analytics at Wharton; Schmidt DataX Fund at Princeton University; National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Microsoft Research Computational Social Science postdoctoral researcher program(Microsoft),"For excellent research assistance, we thank Taylor Damann.

The previous empirical literature has measured discretion and delegation by manually coding large bodies of legislation. Drawing from computational linguistics, we provide an automated procedure for measuring discretion and delegation in legal texts to facilitate large-scale empirical analysis. The method uses information in syntactic parse trees to identify legally relevant provisions, as well as agents and delegated actions. We undertake two applications. First, we produce a measure of bureaucratic discretion by looking at the level of legislative detail for US states and find that this measure increases after reforms giving agencies more independence. This effect is consistent with an agency cost model, where a more independent bureaucracy requires more specific instructions (less discretion) to avoid bureaucratic drift. Second, we construct measures of delegation to governors in state legislation. Consistent with previous estimates using non-text metrics, we find that executive delegation increases under unified government.","[Vannoni, Matia] Kings Coll London, London WC2B 4BG, England; [Ash, Elliott] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Morelli, Massimo] Bocconi Univ, I-20136 Milan, Italy; [Morelli, Massimo] CEPR, I-20136 Milan, Italy",,"Vannoni, M (corresponding author), Kings Coll London, London WC2B 4BG, England.",matia.vannoni@kcl.ac.uk; ashe@ethz.ch; massimo.morelli@unibocconi.it,,"Vannoni, Matia/0000-0002-8335-6402",European Research Council [694583],European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC)European Commission),This work was supported by the European Research Council Advanced Grant [694583].,,48,4,4,4,12,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1047-1987,1476-4989,,POLIT ANAL,Polit.

While media have long been acknowledged as important channels of anti-immigration rhetoric, the evidence of the actual impact of news consumption on attitudes to migration and support for populist parties is still inconclusive, and largely limited to pre-digital media ecologies. Combining a representative two-wave panel survey (N=819), digital tracking of real-time electronic measurement of television, radio and online media exposure, and an analysis of news content, this study explores the effect of news consumption on anti-immigration attitudes and electoral behaviour during the EP2019 election campaign in the Czech Republic. Our analysis reveals that being exposed to news about migration - particularly on websites and on commercial television stations - increases the likelihood of voting for populist parties, while exposure to public service media leads to less negative attitudes towards immigration. At the same time, being exposed to more news sources intensifies, rather than reduces, anti-immigrant attitudes. This result challenges the assumption that a more diverse news media diet could serve as an antidote to selective exposure and echo chambers, commonly linked with radicalization of political views.","[Stetka, Vaclav; Mihelj, Sabina; Toth, Fanni] Loughborough Univ, Commun & Media, Loughborough LE11 3TU, Leics, England",,"Stetka, V (corresponding author), Loughborough Univ, Commun & Media, Loughborough LE11 3TU, Leics, England.",V.Stetka@lboro.ac.uk,"Stetka, Vaclav/AAR-6858-2021; Mihelj, Sabina/AAS-7495-2021","Stetka, Vaclav/0000-0001-8381-3645; Mihelj, Sabina/0000-0002-8557-2504; Toth, Fanni/0000-0003-0572-1002",Economic and Social Research Council [ES/S01019X/1]; ESRC [ES/S01019X/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),This work was supported by the Economic and Social Research Council [ES/S01019X/1].,,53,4,4,3,24,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1058-4609,1091-7675,,POLIT COMMUN,Polit.

A key objective is to show how an innovative corpus-based technique, keyword analysis, can be used as a first step towards identifying communicative styles. We view communicative style as a linguistic means by which rapport is managed amongst participants (Spencer-Oatey 2008). Our primary data include 685 forum posts, of which 273 (over 26,000 words) were by the mentors at the heart of our study. We show that the three mentors have different communicative styles: different rapport management orientations are achieved in different ways. Furthermore, we bring together multiple data sources, including participants' posts and self-reported perception data. This allows us to find evidence on if and how communicative styles impact on student engagement and perception. We discovered that rapport enhancement aligns with increased active participation, especially if a self-effacement strategy is used, and positive student perception, but that the lack of such rapport does not automatically imply negative student perception.","[Culpeper, Jonathan] Univ Lancaster, Dept Linguist & English Language, Lancaster, England; [Kan, Qian] Open Univ, Sch Languages & Appl Linguist, Milton Keynes, Bucks, England",,"Culpeper, J (corresponding author), Univ Lancaster, Dept Linguist & English Language, Lancaster, England.",j.culpeper@lancaster.ac.uk,,"Kan, Qian/0000-0001-7440-847X; Culpeper, Jonathan/0000-0001-9833-6087","UK's ESRC; Centre for Corpus Approaches to Social Science (CASS) [ES/K002155/1, ES/R008906/1]; ESRC [ES/R008906/1] Funding Source: UKRI",UK's ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Centre for Corpus Approaches to Social Science (CASS); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"The authors would like to thank the anonymous reviewers and the journal editor for their valuable comments on the earlier drafts of this article.

The proximity of security concerns in language testing with broader national immigration policy objectives suggests a complex role for language tests as gatekeeping devices. This article draws on critical discourse studies to explore this issue. Documents provided in the 2014 tender round for selecting Secure English Language Tests (acquired through a Freedom of Information request) were analysed through a discourse-historical lens (Reisigl and Wodak 2016) to map salient topics and identify discursive strategies used to construct 'secure English language testing'. Findings show that security is a prominent topic in the tender; prospective bidders are required to meet detailed security requirements and to police subcontractors, and social actors, spaces, objects, policies and procedures are routinely described in securitized terms. Implications are drawn for understanding the role of language tests within broader securitization processes.","[Harding, Luke; Brunfaut, Tineke; Unger, Johann W.] Univ Lancaster, Dept Linguist & English Language, Lancaster, England",,"Harding, L (corresponding author), Univ Lancaster, Dept Linguist & English Language, Lancaster, England.",l.harding@lancaster.ac.uk,"Unger, Johnny/AAV-6731-2020; Brunfaut, Tineke/X-2200-2019","Unger, Johnny/0000-0001-8059-9540; Brunfaut, Tineke/0000-0001-8018-8004; Harding, Luke/0000-0001-9579-6571",,,,,45,4,4,7,19,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0142-6001,1477-450X,,APPL LINGUIST,Appl.

Further, I hypothesize protest tactics influence how news organizations frame demands. Evaluating black-led protests between 1960 and 1972, I find nonviolent activism, particularly when met with state or vigilante repression, drove media coverage, framing, congressional speech, and public opinion on civil rights. Counties proximate to nonviolent protests saw presidential Democratic vote share increase 1.6-2.5%. Protester-initiated violence, by contrast, helped move news agendas, frames, elite discourse, and public concern toward social control. In 1968, using rainfall as an instrument, I find violent protests likely caused a 1.5-7.9% shift among whites toward Republicans and tipped the election.

This perceived conflict challenges a key expectation of literatures on political media and the presidency: that functional interdependence will encourage presidential administrations to tolerate more aggressive media questioning in an effort to control media messages. We examine the interactions between U.S. presidential administrations and the White House press corps through thirty-five years of press briefing transcripts to assess the underpinnings of the current shift. We evaluate key hypotheses via a sentiment analysis using the NRC Emotional Lexicon. Generally, each side tends to reinforce, or mirror, positive and negative language of the counterparty during press briefings. However, we find a significant disjunction with the Trump Administration. Trump Administration representatives use negative language at higher rates than previous administrations and respond more sensitively to changes in press tone by decreasing positive language in response to press negativity. We discuss implications for the dynamic role of the media in shaping these changes.","[Meyer-Gutbrod, Joshua; Woolley, John] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Polit Sci, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA",,"Meyer-Gutbrod, J (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Polit Sci, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.",jmeyergutbrod@ucsb.edu,,,National Science Foundation SBE Postdoctoral Research Fellowship [1808962],National Science Foundation SBE Postdoctoral Research Fellowship,For Dr. Meyer-Gutbrod: This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation SBE Postdoctoral Research Fellowship under Grant No. 1808962.,,53,2,2,2,14,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1058-4609,1091-7675,,POLIT COMMUN,Polit.

Findings from a qualitative textual analysis reveal an open commitment to ideological, activist and value-driven reporting by the sites. Outlets openly disclose their biases, attack the mainstream media and privilege truths from subjective perspectives, appealing to partisan audiences disillusioned with the mainstream press.

Despite the close relation of incivility with social and cultural norms of what is an acceptable form of discussion, studies are mostly restricted to one country. To overcome this blind spot, we conduct a cross-national experiment in three countries (the Netherlands, UK and Spain) testing whether civil and uncivil forms of mediated political conflict affect cynicism toward the EU, political participation intentions, and the support for the policies discussed. Results indicate that despite different levels of conflict in the news, and different levels of cynicism and participation in these countries, the effects of incivility are homogenous. Uncivil political conflict has negative effects on political participation intention and policy support but does not significantly affect cynicism ? in each of the three countries. We also test the role of an individual-level factor, namely Tolerance for Disagreement (TfD). Citizens with low levels of TfD are more affected by uncivil conflict, while subjects with high TfD seem to be immune against violations of social norms. We discuss these finding against the backdrop of individual and cultural influences on political communication effects and cross-cultural experimental research in more general terms.","[Otto, Lukas P.] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Sch Commun Res, Polit Commun & Journalism, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Lecheler, Sophie] Univ Vienna, Dept Commun, Polit Commun, Vienna, Austria; [Lecheler, Sophie] Univ Vienna, Polit Commun Res Grp, Vienna, Austria; [Schuck, Andreas R.

Drawing on normative theories of deliberation, we identify empirical standards for good deliberation based on one's ability both to speak and to be heard, and use natural language processing methods to generate these measures. We first show that, even in the rural Indian context, these assemblies are not mere talking shops, but rather provide opportunities for citizens to challenge their elected officials, demand transparency, and provide information about local development needs. Second, we find that women are at a disadvantage relative to men; they are less likely to speak, set the agenda, and receive a relevant response from state officials. And finally, we show that quotas for women for village presidencies improve the likelihood that female citizens are heard.","[Parthasarathy, Ramya] Stanford Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Rao, Vijayendra] World Bank, Dev Res Grp, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Palaniswamy, Nethra] World Bank, Poverty Global Practice, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA",,"Parthasarathy, R (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",ramyap1@alumni.stanford.edu; vrao@worldbank.org; npalaniswamy@worldbank.org,,,UK Aid from the UK government; Australian Government's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade; European Commission (EC) through the South Asia Food and Nutrition Security Initiative (SAFANSI),UK Aid from the UK government(CGIAR); Australian Government's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade(Australian Government); European Commission (EC) through the South Asia Food and Nutrition Security Initiative (SAFANSI)(European Commission),"This paper is a product of the World Bank's Social Observatory.

Based on the analysis of a corpus of 2.2 million words from the same leading journals in four disciplines in 1965, 1985, and 2015, we document a substantial rise in citations over the period, particularly in applied linguistics and sociology. This is partly because there is now so much more research to report and that recognizing previous work is much easier as a result of electronic access and hyperlinks to sources. But citation is also increasingly required as a means of appropriately embedding research more securely in disciplinary understandings. Our results also show a fall in the use of reporting structures, a growing preference for non-integral forms, for research verbs, for the present tense, and for non-evaluative structures when reporting others' research. While patterns differ by discipline, there is a general trend towards writers suppressing human agency in knowledge-making and emphasizing the reported studies rather than those who conducted them to show how earlier research supports their own.","[Hyland, Ken] Univ East Anglia, Sch Educ & Lifelong Learning, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England; [Jiang, Feng (Kevin)] Jilin Univ, Sch Foreign Language Educ, Changchun, Jilin, Peoples R China",,"Hyland, K (corresponding author), Univ East Anglia, Sch Educ & Lifelong Learning, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England.",k.hyland@uea.ac.uk,"Hyland, Ken/ABH-8176-2020; Jiang, Kevin/AAT-5052-2021","Jiang, Kevin/0000-0001-7369-9498",,,,,39,17,17,11,66,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0142-6001,1477-450X,,APPL LINGUIST,Appl.

After arguing for the use of 'task difficulty' instead of 'task complexity', the notion of task interactional difficulty is analyzed, first by reviewing previous SLA research, then by elaborating an explicit theoretical definition. An operationalization is suggested in terms of three dimensions: number of turn exchanges, number of initiating moves, and visual access among participants. The first two parameters can be measured on native speakers' task performance, while the third may be assessed with two categorical values. To demonstrate the feasibility of this approach, these measures are applied to a corpus of native speakers of Italian performing six different oral tasks, which are then ranked according to their interactional difficulty. Implications for SLA research and task-based language teaching and assessment are discussed, as well as possible ways of extending this procedure to other types of tasks and other facets of difficulty.","[Pallotti, Gabriele] Univ Modena & Reggio Emilia, Dept Educ & Human Sci, Via Allegri 9, I-42121 Reggio Emilia, Italy",,"Pallotti, G (corresponding author), Univ Modena & Reggio Emilia, Dept Educ & Human Sci, Via Allegri 9, I-42121 Reggio Emilia, Italy.",pallotti.gabriele@unimore.it,,,,,,,59,4,4,0,17,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0142-6001,1477-450X,,APPL LINGUIST,Appl.

We argue that in contrast to other studies investigating effects of political ads, our approach is more apt to capture the natural environment in which political ads are encountered during a presidential campaign. We focus on the intense inundation of political ads voters are confronted with in swing states in the weeks leading up to the presidential election, and argue that it is unclear a priori whether we should expect advertising to affect vote intention in that critical circumstance. We empirically validate this hypothesis using a trove of data from the 2012 campaign: daily polling in media markets around the country, detailed data on all registered voters in the country, all TV advertisements by market and exact airtime, and the entire Twitter corpus. We find that neither overall increases in advertising spending nor partisan imbalances in spending expanded the candidates' electorate. In fact, total Designated Market Area (DMA)-level spending significantly moderates a negative relationship between spending advantages and advantages in vote intention, suggesting a boomerang effect of additional spending late in the campaign. In closing, we discuss the ramifications of our findings for future research, and stress the importance of research tracking advertising effects.","[Konitzer, Tobias] Stanford Univ, Commun, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Rothschild, David; Hill, Shawndra] Microsoft Res, New York, NY USA; [Wilbur, Kenneth C.] Univ Calif San Diego, Mkt, Rady Sch Management, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA",,"Konitzer, T (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, 450 Serra Mall, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",tobiask@stanford.edu,"Li, Wang/M-1612-2019",,,,,,29,5,5,0,25,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1058-4609,1091-7675,,POLIT COMMUN,Polit.

From a methodological point of view, the robustness of a combined approach is examined. For this purpose the results of different machine translation services (Google Translate vs. DeepL) as well as methods (full-text vs. term-by-term) are compared. From a substantive point of view, the integratability of the approach into comparative study designs is tested. For this, the online discourses about climate change in Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States are compared. First, the results show that the approach is relatively robust and second, that integration in comparative study designs is not a problem. It is concluded that this as well as the relatively moderate costs in terms of time and money makes the strategy to couple topic models with machine translation a valuable addition to the toolbox of comparative communication researchers.","[Reber, Ueli] Univ Bern, Inst Commun & Media Studies, Fabrikstr 8, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland",,"Reber, U (corresponding author), Univ Bern, Inst Commun & Media Studies, Fabrikstr 8, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland.",ueli.reber@ikmb.unibe.ch,,"Reber, Ueli/0000-0001-8036-4493","German Research Foundation (DFG) [FOR 1381, 07, 155794648]; Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) [100017E-154100]",German Research Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)),"This publication was created in the context of the Research Unit Political Communication in the Online World (FOR 1381), Subproject 07, which is funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG, project number 155794648).

It resists generalizations and makes scholars of politics comparativist by necessity, as its language and content are imbued with the political culture of the society in which it arises. A rich body of socio-historical analyses allows us to situate populism within the global phenomenon called democracy, as its ideological core is nourished by the two main entities-the nation and the people-that have fleshed out popular sovereignty in the age of democratization. Populism consists in a transmutation of the democratic principles of the majority and the people in a way that is meant to celebrate one subset of the people as opposed to another, through a leader embodying it and an audience legitimizing it. This may make populism collide with constitutional democracy, even if its main tenets are embedded in the democratic universe of meanings and language. In this article, I illustrate the context-based character of populism and how its cyclical appearances reflect the forms of representative government. I review the main contemporary interpretations of the concept and argue that some basic agreement now exists on populism's rhetorical character and its strategy for achieving power in democratic societies. Finally, I sketch the main characteristics of populism in power and explain how it tends to transform the fundamentals of democracy: the people and the majority, elections, and representation.","[Urbinati, Nadia] Columbia Univ, Dept Polit Sci, New York, NY 10027 USA",,"Urbinati, N (corresponding author), Columbia Univ, Dept Polit Sci, New York, NY 10027 USA.",nu15@columbia.edu,,,,,,,77,70,73,5,29,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1094-2939,1545-1577,,ANNU REV POLIT SCI,Annu.

Rather, it is treated as a self-explanatory concept related to privacy. To overcome this omission, this article develops a complex understanding of anonymity in the context of democratic theory. Drawing upon the diverse literature on anonymity in political participation, it explains anonymity as a highly context-dependent identity performance expressing private sentiments in the public sphere. The contradictory character of its core elements-identity negation and identity creation-results in three sets of contradictory freedoms. Anonymity affords (a) inclusion and exclusion, (b) subversion and submission, and (c) honesty and deception. This contradictory character of anonymity's affordances illustrates the ambiguous role of anonymity in democracy.","[Asenbaum, Hans] Univ Westminster, Ctr Study Democracy, Dept Polit & Int Relat, 309 Regent St, London W1B 2HW, England",,"Asenbaum, H (corresponding author), Univ Westminster, Ctr Study Democracy, Dept Polit & Int Relat, 309 Regent St, London W1B 2HW, England.",H.Asenbaum@westminster.ac.uk,"Asenbaum, Hans/AAJ-7393-2020","Asenbaum, Hans/0000-0001-9780-9735",,,,,72,19,19,2,14,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0003-0554,1537-5943,,AM POLIT SCI REV,Am.

Using highly disaggregated election data and an original survey, we estimate that Russian television substantially increased average electoral support for parties and candidates with a pro-Russian agenda in the 2014 presidential and parliamentary elections. Evidence suggests that this effect is attributable to persuasion rather than differential mobilization. The effectiveness of biased media varied in a politically consequential way: Its impact was largest on voters with strong pro-Russian priors but was less effective, and to some degree even counter-effective, in persuading those with strong pro-Western priors.

Missing from CDA, however, is triangulation incorporating experimental methodologies. In this paper, I argue that CDA in general can benefit from an experimental dimension and that cognitive linguistic approaches in particular lend themselves to extension into experimentalism. I demonstrate this by reporting a recent experiment carried out within a cognitive linguistic framework on the effects of regular transactive versus reciprocal verbs in news reports of political protests. Results of the experiment show that in the context of media discourse on political protests, the presentation of these alternative constructions, as well as differences in information sequence, affect how people apportion blame and the level of aggression they perceive in social actors. The experiment thus not only provides evidence for the ideological effects of these particular linguistic differences but more generally goes some way to justifying CDA's focus on micro-level lexico-grammatical features of texts.","[Hart, Christopher] Univ Lancaster, Dept Linguist & English Language, Lancaster, England",,"Hart, C (corresponding author), Univ Lancaster, Dept Linguist & English Language, Lancaster, England.",c.hart@lancaster.ac.uk,,"Hart, Christopher James/0000-0002-7469-7731",,,,,83,11,11,7,42,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0142-6001,1477-450X,,APPL LINGUIST,Appl.

The focus is, in particular, on how different operationalizations of what constitutes a 'different word' (type) impact on the LD measures themselves and on their ability to discriminate between CEFR levels. The results show that basic measures of LD, such as the number of different words, the TTR (Templin 1957), and the Index of Guiraud (Guiraud 1954) explain more variance in the CEFR levels than sophisticated measures, such as D (Malvern et al. 2004), HD-D (McCarthy and Jarvis 2007), and MTLD (McCarthy 2005) provided text length is kept constant across texts. A simple count of different words (defined as lemma's and not as word families) was the best predictor of CEFR levels and explained 22 per cent of the variance in overall scores on the Pearson Test of English Academic in essays written by 176 test takers.","[Treffers-Daller, Jeanine] Univ Reading, Inst Educ, Reading, Berks, England; [Parslow, Patrick; Williams, Shirley] Univ Reading, Syst Engn, Reading, Berks, England",,"Treffers-Daller, J (corresponding author), Univ Reading, Inst Educ, Reading, Berks, England.",j.c.treffers-daller@reading.ac.uk,"Treffers-Daller, Jeanine/ABD-7048-2021","Treffers-Daller, Jeanine/0000-0002-6575-6736","Language Testing, a trading division of Pearson Education Ltd.","Language Testing, a trading division of Pearson Education Ltd.","This work was funded by Language Testing, a trading division of Pearson Education Ltd.

To aid researchers working in unsupervised settings, we introduce a statistical procedure and software that examines the sensitivity of findings under alternate preprocessing regimes. This approach complements a researcher's substantive understanding of a problem by providing a characterization of the variability changes in preprocessing choices may induce when analyzing a particular dataset. In making scholars aware of the degree to which their results are likely to be sensitive to their preprocessing decisions, it aids replication efforts.","[Denny, Matthew J.] Penn State Univ, 203 Pond Lab, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Spirling, Arthur] NYU, Off 405,19 West 4th St, New York, NY 10012 USA",,"Denny, MJ (corresponding author), Penn State Univ, 203 Pond Lab, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",mdenny@psu.edu; arthur.spirling@nyu.edu,,,National Science Foundation under IGERT Grant [DGE-1144860],National Science Foundation under IGERT Grant,This research was supported by the National Science Foundation under IGERT Grant DGE-1144860.,,41,108,109,3,32,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1047-1987,1476-4989,,POLIT ANAL,Polit.

Key to the theory are two points: (1) common-knowledge lies may be understood as flagrant violations of the norm of truth-telling; and (2) when a political system is suffering from a crisis of legitimacy (Lipset 1959) with respect to at least one political constituency, members of that constituency will be motivated to see a flagrant violator of established norms as an authentic champion of its interests. Two online vignette experiments on a simulated college election support our theory. These results demonstrate that mere partisanship is insufficient to explain sharp differences in how lying demagoguery is perceived, and that several oft-discussed factorsinformation access, culture, language, and genderare not necessary for explaining such differences. Rather, for the lying demagogue to have authentic appeal, it is sufficient that one side of a social divide regards the political system as flawed or illegitimate.","[Hahl, Oliver] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Tepper Sch Business, Business, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA; [Kim, Minjae] MIT, Sloan Sch Management, Econ Sociol Program, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Sivan, Ezra W.

This article presents a critical-cognitive approach that is an evidence-based account of whether, and to what extent, English plays a role in identity constructions and their connection to the local politics of English. This approach is analytically powerful and productive not only in capturing the varying degrees of the contribution of the English language and its role but also in unraveling the ideological dimensions of identity and the English language. Examples of Chinese-English bilingual ads that are representative of the structural features of English mixing are used for the illustrative analysis.

Target materials included picture narratives from 40 native French speakers of English from different proficiency levels. The narratives were subsequently rated by 20 native speakers with or without linguistic and pedagogical experience for comprehensibility, accentedness, and 11 linguistic variables spanning the domains of phonology, lexis, grammar, and discourse structure. Results showed that comprehensibility was associated with several linguistic variables (vowel/consonant errors, word stress, fluency, lexis, grammar), whereas accentedness was chiefly linked to pronunciation (vowel/consonant errors, word stress). Native-speaking listeners thus appear to pay particular attention to pronunciation, rather than lexis and grammar, to evaluate nativelikeness but tend to consider various sources of linguistic information in L2 speech in judging comprehensibility. The use of listener ratings (perceptual measures) in evaluating linguistic aspects of learner speech and their implications for language assessment and pedagogy are discussed.","[Saito, Kazuya] Birkbeck Univ London, Dept Appl Linguist & Commun, London, England; [Trofimovich, Pavel] Concordia Univ, Dept Educ, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Isaacs, Talia] Univ Bristol, Grad Sch Educ, Bristol, Avon, England",,"Saito, K (corresponding author), Birkbeck Univ London, Dept Appl Linguist & Commun, London, England.",k.saito@bbk.ac.uk,,"Saito, Kazuya/0000-0002-4718-2943",,,,,56,66,67,2,58,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0142-6001,1477-450X,,APPL LINGUIST,Appl.

In addition, we examine how policy design as well as federal oversight and enforcement shape implementation and compliance with the language assistance provisions. Our findings not only provide the first systemic evidence that the language assistance provisions have a direct effect on Latino representation, but also link the efficacy of the language assistance provisions to the duration and consistency of coverage and the presence of federal elections observers.

This article contributes to the literature by focusing not on aggregate, behavioral political attention for issues (e.g., parliamentary questions or legislation), but on Members of Parliament's (MP) individual, cognitive attention for specific news stories. Drawing upon a survey of Belgian MPs administered shortly after exposure to news stories, the study shows that MPs are highly selective in exploiting media cues. They pay more attention to both prominent and useful news stories, but a story's usefulness is more important for cognitive processes that are closely linked to MPs' real behavior in parliament. In other words, aggregate political agenda-setting effects are a consequence of the way in which individual MPs process media information that matches their task-related needs.","[Sevenans, Julie; Walgrave, Stefaan; Epping, Gwendolyn Joanna] Univ Antwerp, Dept Polit Sci, Antwerp, Belgium",,"Sevenans, J (corresponding author), Univ Antwerp, Sint Jacobstr 2, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium.",julie.sevenans@uantwerpen.be,"Walgrave, Stefaan/P-6545-2016","Walgrave, Stefaan/0000-0003-1814-1015",European Research Council [295735]; Research Fund of the University of Antwerp [26827],European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC)European Commission); Research Fund of the University of Antwerp,"The authors gratefully acknowledge support of the European Research Council (Advanced Grant 'INFOPOL', No 295735) and of the Research Fund of the University of Antwerp (Grant No 26827).

This article offers a critical examination of the interaction of feminist theories and the international human rights discourses as articulated at the UN forums and documents. It contends that although a range of feminisms that elucidate the diversity of women's experiences and complexities of oppression have been incorporated into some UN documents, the overall women's rights approach of the UN is still informed by the demands and expectations of liberal feminism. This is particularly evident in the aggregate indicators that are employed to assess the empowerment of women. In addition to explaining why liberal feminism trumps other feminisms, the article addresses the problems with following policies that are informed by liberal feminism. Noting that the integrative approach of liberal feminism may establish gender equality without empowering the majority of women, it criticizes using aggregate indicators of empowerment for conflating sources of power with empowerment and making false assumptions.","[Arat, Zehra F.

We document the scope and consequences of affective polarization of partisans using implicit, explicit, and behavioral indicators. Our evidence demonstrates that hostile feelings for the opposing party are ingrained or automatic in voters' minds, and that affective polarization based on party is just as strong as polarization based on race. We further show that party cues exert powerful effects on nonpolitical judgments and behaviors. Partisans discriminate against opposing partisans, doing so to a degree that exceeds discrimination based on race. We note that the willingness of partisans to display open animus for opposing partisans can be attributed to the absence of norms governing the expression of negative sentiment and that increased partisan affect provides an incentive for elites to engage in confrontation rather than cooperation.","[Iyengar, Shanto] Stanford Univ, Commun, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Iyengar, Shanto] Stanford Univ, Polit Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Westwood, Sean J.] Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA",,"Iyengar, S (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Commun, Bldg 120,Room 110,450 Serra Mall, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",siyengar@stanford.edu; seanjwestwood@gmail.com,,"iyengar, shanto/0000-0003-2406-719X",,,,,68,702,705,18,172,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0092-5853,1540-5907,,AM J POLIT SCI,Am.

This dimension of classroom discourse, however, has not been studied systematically. Taking a corpus-based approach, this study investigates the non-informational dimension of classroom discourse, focusing on the marking of emotions, affect, and the speaker's 'involvement' (Chafe 1982) in the talk of university professors, in a large corpus of American university classroom discourse. It tracks the use of involvement markers across class sessions representing three situational factors that define the university setting: academic discipline, level of instruction, and class size. Surprisingly, these factors have relatively little influence on involvement in language, suggesting that involvement is pervasive in American classroom talk. However, involvement tends to be more common in small courses in the Humanities and Social Sciences, at the upper division and graduate level-courses that generally favor student participation, hence interactivity in discourse. Analyses of the relationship between involvement and interactivity reveal that while interactivity tends to predict involvement, involvement is not limited to interactive discourse.","Swansea Univ, Dept English Language & Literature, Swansea SA2 8PP, W Glam, Wales",,"Barbieri, F (corresponding author), Swansea Univ, Dept English Language & Literature, Swansea SA2 8PP, W Glam, Wales.",f.barbieri@swansea.ac.uk,,"Barbieri, Federica/0000-0001-9088-7730",,,,,58,8,7,3,41,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0142-6001,1477-450X,,APPL LINGUIST,Appl.

We systematically analyze White House, military, congressional, and news communications and draw upon scholarship in social psychology to assess why the press might challenge certain frames in response to My Lai but indiscriminately echo others. In particular, within these communications, we examine how serious and widespread the actions at My Lai were conveyed to be, how the circumstances were portrayed, how the actors involved in the incident were characterized, and the extent to which America's core values were questioned. Our findings suggest that the Nixon administration employed frames designed to downplay the severity of the My Lai incident, highlight extenuating circumstances faced by those directly involved, denigrate the alleged low-level perpetrators, and bolster the national identity. These frames were then largely echoed in the press, despite consistent and forceful challenges by congressional Democrats. These findings, we argue, align with the cascading activation model, and we build on it by highlighting the underlying importance of cultural resonance in the framing process. We reflect on the theoretical and practical implications of these patterns and, in doing so, engage the broader scholarly debate over the process through which U.S. news coverage aligns with the communications of government officials, particularly in moments of national dissonance.","[Rowling, Charles M.] Univ Nebraska Kearney, Dept Polit Sci, Kearney, NE 68849 USA; [Sheets, Penelope] Univ Amsterdam, Sch Commun Res, NL-1012 WX Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Jones, Timothy M.] Bellevue Coll, Dept Polit Sci, Bellevue, WA 98007 USA",,"Rowling, CM (corresponding author), Univ Nebraska Kearney, Dept Polit Sci, Founders Hall 2240, Kearney, NE 68849 USA.",rowlingcm@unk.edu,,,,,,,53,7,7,1,10,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1058-4609,1091-7675,,POLIT COMMUN,Polit.

To better explain how leaders acquire information, I develop and test an informational theory of bureaucracies during crises. Time-constrained leaders delegate information collection to advisers who lead bureaucracies. A division of labor between bureaucracies breeds comparative specialization among advisers. Some emphasize information on adversaries' political attributes, which are harder to assess; others stress military attributes, which are easier to assess. Bureaucratic role thus affects the content and uncertainty that advisers provide. I use automated and qualitative coding to measure adviser input in 5,400 texts from US Cold War crises. As hypothesized, advisers' positions affect the information and uncertainty they convey but not the policies they promote as canonical theories suggest. For individuals advising leaders during crises, what you know depends on where you sit. Consequently, the information leaders possess hinges on which bureaucracies have their attention.","[Schub, Robert] Univ Nebraska, Dept Polit Sci, Lincoln, NE 68583 USA",,"Schub, R (corresponding author), Univ Nebraska, Dept Polit Sci, Lincoln, NE 68583 USA.",robert.schub@unl.edu,,"Schub, Robert/0000-0003-3315-4957",,,,,78,0,0,1,1,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0003-0554,1537-5943,,AM POLIT SCI REV,Am.

While news media cannot deliver policy on their own, they are fully equipped to represent, interpret, and amplify grievance. If disaffection is directed at retribution rather than policy, journalism contributes to backsliding in the further pathologizing of (non)-responsive government. This essay proposes critical realism (CR) as a heuristic for conceptualizing unique contributions of news media to backsliding. Reality consists of layered strata in CR. This approach accepts the premise of news as a social construction but maintains that a domain of reality exists independent of discursive representation, and that this realm can be actualized in ways that are damaging to democracy. Applied to political communication, the domain of the real includes democratic deficits that may or may not become actualized depending on how journalism operates at the empirical level. Critical realism also generates insights applicable to reform. CR insists that journalists avoid reifying sentiment in ways that comfort authoritarians. The diagnostic acknowledges the journalistic conviction that an external reality is knowable, positing nevertheless that the news interacts with underlying social forces. The profession must forge a healthier relationship with the public to avoid reifying audience support for anti-democratic norms. Reflexivity could be directed beyond the recognition of complicity to two productive rationales for safeguarding democracy: liberal multiculturalism and journalistic paternalism. A final section offers a framework for future research in tracing linkages between journalistic practice and backsliding.","[McDevitt, Michael] Univ Colorado, Polit Commun, Boulder, CO 80309 USA",,"McDevitt, M (corresponding author), Univ Colorado, Polit Commun, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",mike.mcdevitt@colorado.edu,,,,,,,77,0,0,5,5,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1058-4609,1091-7675,,POLIT COMMUN,Polit.

To date, theories of judicial decision making are rooted in ranked societies with majority-minority group cleavages, leaving unanswered which groups are more prone to express bias and whether it is motivated by in-group favoritism or out-group hostility. We examine judicial bias in Kenya, a diverse society that features a more complex ethnic landscape. While research in comparative and African politics emphasizes instrumental motivations underpinning ethnic identity, we examine the psychological, implicit biases driving judicial outcomes. Using data from Kenyan criminal appeals and the conditional random assignment of judges to cases, we show that judges are 3 to 5 percentage points more likely to grant coethnic appeals than non-coethnic appeals. To understand mechanisms, we use word embeddings to analyze the sentiment of written judgments. Judges use more trust-related terms writing for coethnics, suggesting that in-group favoritism motivates coethnic bias in this context.","[Choi, Donghyun Danny] Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Polit Sci, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA; [Harris, J.

The article uses data from the South African educational context to advance a position in which semiotic repertoires simultaneously give and restrict access, evoke evaluation and construct identities in particular ways because of their entanglement with (racialized) bodies. I propose that this simultaneity can be theorized by viewing the black body as 'intercorporeal' and 'grotesque' (Bakhtin 1984). By drawing on such an approach, processes of racialization are explicitly connected to how semiotic resources are evoked in discourse. This article thus theoretically contributes to the recent movements in applied linguistics that view language as embodied, re-examine repertoires, and view language as multiplex and entangled. In addition, it also offers a framing that can theoretically challenge discourses of post-racialism with its multilayered account of how race continues to be experienced as a significant form of meaning-making.","[OOSTENDORP, M.

I do so by tracing how the post-1959 Cuban regime attempted to build a population-wide revolutionary identity despite persisting cultural understandings of women primarily as apolitical housewives. Through systematic analysis of a large corpus of state discourse in the form of speeches and women's magazines, I show how regime leaders negotiated, with varying degrees of success over time, the cultural constraints that gender posed to their unifying project. Ultimately, the regime's initiatives to politicize women through including them in mass campaigns and radicalizing their traditional household tasks were relatively successful, but cultural backlash against women's increasing presence in the labor force prompted the institutionalization of a gendered division of labor in the economy that traditionalized their initially radical entry into the workplace. Analyzing how political elites confront and manage social differences within political blocs promises to contribute to a better understanding of the political production of social solidarity and its downstream effects on categorical inequalities.","[Triplett, Jen] Univ Michign, Dept Sociol, Room 3115 LSA Bldg,500 S State St, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",,"Triplett, J (corresponding author), Univ Michign, Dept Sociol, Room 3115 LSA Bldg,500 S State St, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",jentrip@umich.edu,,,University of Michigan's Rackham Student Research Grant,University of Michigan's Rackham Student Research Grant,This project was supported by the University of Michigan's Rackham Student Research Grant.,,91,0,0,2,2,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0003-1224,1939-8271,,AM SOCIOL REV,Am.

Recent years have seen notable advances in the automated coding of political event data from international news sources. Yet, the validity of machine-coded event data remains disputed, especially in the context of event geolocation. We analyze the frequencies of human- and machine-geocoded event data agreement in relation to an independent (ground truth) source. The events are human rights violations in Colombia. We perform our evaluation for a key, 8-year period of the Colombian conflict and in three 2-year subperiods as well as for a selected set of (non)journalistically remote municipalities. As a complement to this analysis, we estimate spatial probit models based on the three datasets. These models assume Gaussian Markov Random Field error processes; they are constructed using a stochastic partial differential equation and estimated with integrated nested Laplacian approximation. The estimated models tell us whether the three datasets produce comparable predictions, underreport events in relation to the same covariates, and have similar patterns of prediction error. Together the two analyses show that, for this subnational conflict, the machine- and human-geocoded datasets are comparable in terms of external validity but, according to the geostatistical models, produce prediction errors that differ in important respects.","[Stundal, Logan; Holmes, Jennifer S.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Polit Sci, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Bagozzi, Benjamin E.] Univ Delaware, Dept Polit Sci & IR, Newark, DE USA; [Freeman, John R.] UT Dallas, Sch Econ Polit & Policy Sci, Richardson, TX USA",,"Stundal, L (corresponding author), Univ Minnesota, Dept Polit Sci, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.",stund005@umn.edu; bagozzib@udel.edu; freeman@umn.edu; jholmes@utdallas.edu,,"Stundal, Logan/0000-0003-0444-4154; Bagozzi, Benjamin/0000-0002-6233-6453",National Science Foundation [SBE-SMA-1539302],National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),This work was supported by the National Science Foundation [SBE-SMA-1539302].,,42,0,0,2,2,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1047-1987,1476-4989,,POLIT ANAL,Polit.

What accounts for the variation in news coverage received by different foreign countries? While existing literature points to political concerns at home, in this article, we argue that a regime's economic interests can also be a driving force: the desire to deepen its international economic engagement can motivate the regime to treat foreign countries differently in its news coverage. To test this argument, we examine foreign news coverage by China's state-run television network between 2003 and 2018. Combining textual and quantitative analysis, we find that countries with stronger economic ties with China receive more favorable news coverage. Moreover, the manipulation of coverage favorability is achieved through selective reporting: negative events such as armed conflicts receive less coverage when taking place in a country with close economic ties with China. These findings contribute to our understanding of international news flow, especially in a non-Western setting. They also demonstrate a pragmatic rather than political use of information control by an authoritarian government.","[Ji, Chengyuan] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Int & Publ Affairs, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Liu, Hanzhang] Pitzer Coll, Dept Polit Studies, Claremont, CA 91711 USA",,"Liu, HZ (corresponding author), Pitzer Coll, Dept Polit Studies, Claremont, CA 91711 USA.",hanzhang_liu@pitzer.edu,,"Ji, Chengyuan/0000-0001-8892-3982; Liu, Hanzhang/0000-0003-1003-1372",,,,,47,0,0,18,22,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1058-4609,1091-7675,,POLIT COMMUN,Polit.

However, out-group animosity may operate differently depending on the party or elite. We investigate the extent to which citizens' animus toward (Democratically aligned) minority groups drove political support for Donald Trump, whose incendiary rhetoric regarding such groups is unique in modern presidential politics. Leveraging panel data beginning before Trump's candidacy, we find that animus toward Democratic-linked groups in 2011 predicts future support for Trump regardless of party identity. This animus does not predict future support for other Republican or Democratic politicians or either party. Nor do we find that animus toward Republican groups predicts support for Democratic elites. Trump's support is thus uniquely tied to animus toward minority groups. Our findings provide insights into the social divisions underlying American politics and the role of elite rhetoric in translating animus into political support.","[Mason, Lilliana] Johns Hopkins Univ, SNF Agora Inst, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA; [Mason, Lilliana] Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA; [Wronski, Julie] Univ Mississippi, Dept Polit Sci, University, MS 38677 USA; [Kane, John, V] NYU, Ctr Global Affairs, New York, NY 10003 USA",,"Mason, L (corresponding author), Johns Hopkins Univ, SNF Agora Inst, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA.;Mason, L (corresponding author), Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA.",lmason23@jhu.edu; jwronski@olemiss.edu; jvk221@nyu.edu,"Mason, Lilliana/J-8847-2015","Mason, Lilliana/0000-0002-0305-8246",,,,,15,9,9,1,1,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0003-0554,1537-5943,,AM POLIT SCI REV,Am.

Focusing on the historical production of persons, I analyze interactional recordings, instructional artifacts, and participant interviews collected over three years of qualitative inquiry. The analysis articulates how Tom's narrative of intercultural encounters was reframed, rekeyed, and recycled at home and abroad. Along the way, Tom was identified as (i) an avid learner of Chinese in a language classroom in the USA; (ii) an ignorant foreigner while studying in China; and (iii) a political outcast upon his return to the USA whose intercultural experience abroad, nevertheless, afforded his classmates an opportunity to appreciate a more ethno-relative perspective. The consonance and dissonance of identification are results of interplay between history in person and history in institutionalized struggles. This interplay must be considered to understand the (re)making of language-learning identities across historical time, social space, and communicative modes.

Based on a manual content analysis of 14.690 user comments on nine German news websites, we find that comments with a higher argument strength are more likely to receive disagreement in general and reasoned disagreement in particular. Further, the levels of (reasoned) disagreement are higher on platforms with strong discussion norms and supporting technical features.

It presents a post-hoc CRT analysis of findings from two studies: (i) an ethnographic study examining Spanish curriculum and instructional practices at two minority serving postsecondary institutions and (ii) a participatory action research collaboration with Spanish instructors examining curriculum at a predominantly white institution-both studies linked by how they reveal endemic racism and anti-Blackness in WL programmes. Ultimately, this article addresses how African Americans can more authentically and successfully participate in WL programmes.

Using configurational analyses and data from banks in OECD countries, we identify multiple equifinal combinations of conditions associated with over- and underconformity. We also find that over- and underconformity have different drivers. We conjecture that while overconformity is associated with a shareholder-management coalition in liberal market economies, underconformity results from multiple complex combinations of national and organizational conditions that often include dominant blockholders, strong labor rights, and small organizational size. We leverage these findings to abduct theoretical insights on nonconformity to global corporate governance norms.

The findings suggest that Brazilian ELT, through its reliance on global textbooks, presents interactional scenarios that are often the site of racial humiliation.

Data were collected in two local theaters in a Northeastern city using field interviews, follow-up telephone interviews, and participant observation. Findings revealed that Black womxn audiences (from various age groups) embodied an intersectional resistance discourse of disrespectability ( Cooper, 2012, 2017, 2018) through their (non)verbal behaviors and an ecology of the senses (i.e., sight and sound) that were situated at the intersection of ratchetness, playfulness, and informality. In doing so, they created a homeplace, making an otherwise uncomfortable and highly regulated public space suitable for their collective spectatorship of the film. We argue that Black womxn's embodiment of ratchetness is not necessarily a unidimensional endeavor, but rather an ever-evolving, multifaceted resource that enables Black womxn to reach political and pleasurable ends.","[Davis, Sharde M.] Univ Connecticut, Dept Commun, Storrs, CT 06269 USA; [Tounsel, Timeka N.] Penn State Univ, Dept African Amer Studies, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Tounsel, Timeka N.] Penn State Univ, Dept Media Studies, University Pk, PA 16802 USA",,"Davis, SM (corresponding author), Univ Connecticut, Dept Commun, Storrs, CT 06269 USA.",sharde.davis@uconn.edu,,,,,,,41,0,0,2,2,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0021-9916,1460-2466,,J COMMUN,J.

Research shows that the salience of immigration shapes voters' political behavior, but little is known about whether it influences judicial behavior. This article theorizes that variation in issue salience influences judges' behavior when there is a clear connection between the legal and a generally salient, politicized issue. I test this argument drawing on all Swiss asylum appeal decisions reached between 2007 and 2015. I find that higher asylum salience leads judges to decide otherwise similar asylum appeals less favorably. This effect is not restricted to judges affiliated with anti-immigrant parties, unlikely to be driven by accountability pressures, and strongest for those topics known to drive anti-immigrant sentiment in the general public. Together, these findings raise concerns that issue salience threatens the consistency of judicial decisions.","[Spirig, Judith] UCL, Dept Polit Sci, 29-31 Tavistock Sq, London WC1H 9QU, England; [Spirig, Judith] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Immigrat Policy Lab, Leonhardshalde 21, CH-8090 Zurich, Switzerland",,"Spirig, J (corresponding author), UCL, Dept Polit Sci, 29-31 Tavistock Sq, London WC1H 9QU, England.;Spirig, J (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Immigrat Policy Lab, Leonhardshalde 21, CH-8090 Zurich, Switzerland.",j.spirig@ucl.ac.uk,,,,,,,58,0,0,2,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0092-5853,1540-5907,,AM J POLIT SCI,Am.

Today, it's common for these two youth communities to learn side-by-side in urban and suburban classrooms where they are often positioned to share each other's cultural practices (Martinez 2017). However, language and literacy research often positions these two minoritized communities as mutually exclusive (Paris 2010). Moreover, while researchers have urged the analysis of these two youth communities comparatively few studies document classroom units that cultivate spaces for 'linguistic solidarity' (Martinez 2017). Drawing from an ethnographic study of an 11th-grade ethnic studies class, the authors explore how Arturo (third author) took up a critical translingual approach in his classroom where students-both Latinx and African American-collaborated through the cowriting of corridos (Mexican ballads) about their lived experiences with in/justice.

Intersubject correlations of brain activity during message exposure showed that listening to personal narratives elicited strong audience engagement as evidenced by robust correlations across participants' frontal and parietal lobes compared to a nonpersonal control text and a reversed language control stimulus.

These gains do not come at the expense of white students' academic performance, which also appears to improve.

To study other-regarding behavior, we fielded an experiment through a text-to-give campaign in Greece. Donations did not increase with an appeal to the in-group (Greek child) relative to a control (child), but they were halved with reference to a stigmatized out-group (Roma child). An appeal to fundamental rights, a common advocacy strategy, did not reduce the generosity gap. Donations to all groups were lower near Roma communities and declined disproportionately for the Roma appeal. Qualitative research in 12 communities complements our experiment. We conclude that NGO fundraising strategies that narrowly emphasize either in-groups or out-groups, or fundamental rights language, may not be as effective as broader appeals, and we discuss implications for public goods provision in an era of growing nationalism.","[Linos, Katerina] Univ Calif Berkeley, Law, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Jakli, Laura] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Carlson, Melissa] Stanford Univ, Ctr Int Secur & Cooperat, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",,"Linos, K (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Law, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",klinos@berkeley.edu; ljakli@fas.harvard.edu; melcarl@stanford.edu,,"Jakli, Laura/0000-0001-8475-2231; Linos, Katerina/0000-0002-9530-0211",Carnegie Foundation; Berkeley Law's Miller Center for Global Challenges and the Law; Jean Monnet Program; German Academic Exchange Program; U.C.

That is, the scaled images participants develop through socialization about different time-space frames and the peoples, relations, discourses, and resources therein guide their language use both from and about particular contexts. I discuss the utility of spatiotemporal understandings of repertoires of resources and normalcies in capturing the variability, dynamicity, and complexity of semiotic practices and also in addressing the controversies among scholars regarding the 'realness' of languages and hybridity of multilingual practices. Through decentralizing language(s) and foregrounding context(s) and contextualization, I argue, the chronotope enables us to analyze not only social actors' hybrid utilization of semiotic resources in meaning-making processes, but also their language ideologies and language-ideological practices, which rely heavily on the perceptions of languages as discrete systems.","[Karimzad, Farzad] Salisbury Univ, Dept English, Salisbury, MD 21801 USA",,"Karimzad, F (corresponding author), Salisbury Univ, Dept English, Salisbury, MD 21801 USA.",fkarimzad@salisbury.edu,,"Karimzad, Farzad/0000-0002-9729-4361",,,,,75,4,4,4,4,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0142-6001,1477-450X,,APPL LINGUIST,Appl.

In speaking tests, they have often been overshadowed by an emphasis on production features or subsumed under broader constructs such as interactional competence. This article is an effort to represent the rich IL phenomena that can be found in peer interactive speaking assessments, where the candidate-candidate format and discussion task offer opportunities to elicit and assess IL. Taking a close look at candidate discourse and nonverbal actions through a conversation analytic approach, the analysis focuses on three IL features (i) listenership displays, (ii) contingent responses, and (iii) collaborative completions, and unpacks their relative strength in evidencing listener understanding.

We review the literature and advocate moving beyond the language of the micro- and macro-level divide, instead focusing on the determinants of violence against civilians at five different levels of analysis: international, domestic, subnational, organizational, and individual.

Yet, like the functionalists who introduced the concept, socialization has fallen out of favor, critiqued for ignoring power and agency, for its teleology and incoherence, and for a misguided link to culture of poverty arguments. In this review, we argue for a renewed, postfunctionalist use of socialization. We review the concept's history, its high point under Parsons, the reasons for its demise, its continued use in some subfields (e.g., gender, race and ethnicity, education), and alternative concepts used to explain social reproduction. We then suggest that something is lost when socialization is avoided or isolated in particular subfields. Without socialization, conceptions of social reproduction face problems of history, power, and transferability. We close by outlining a postfunctionalist agenda for socialization research, providing a framework for a new theory of socialization, one that builds off of cognitive science, pragmatism, the study of language, the reinterrogation of values, and the development of ideology in political socialization.","[Guhin, Jeffrey] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Sociol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Calarco, Jessica McCrory] Indiana Univ, Dept Sociol, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Miller-Idriss, Cynthia] Amer Univ, Sch Publ Affairs, Washington, DC 20016 USA; [Miller-Idriss, Cynthia] Amer Univ, Sch Educ, Washington, DC 20016 USA",,"Guhin, J (corresponding author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Sociol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",guhin@soc.ucla.edu; jcalarco@indiana.edu; cynthia@american.edu,,"Miller-Idriss, Cynthia/0000-0002-2849-0799",,,,,152,13,13,19,33,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",0360-0572,1545-2115,978-0-8243-2247-2,ANNU REV SOCIOL,Annu.

We argue that these gaps in knowledge are due to taxing coding procedures required for systematic estimation of strategy framing in large corpora. We use a recently developed unsupervised computational method (ANTMN) to automatically code the news coverage of 312 U.S. Senate candidates in 156 races between 2008 and 2016 in a corpus of 181,725 articles. We found that strategy framing is negatively associated with electoral success.

The scientific diagnosis of the Anthropocene has further generated critical discussion in the social sciences on the need to understand the diversity of local cultural responses to global environmental crises, ranging from climate change to species extinction. This article proposes that a 'green applied linguistics' can offer empirical insights into the role of language and discourse in mediating diverse human relationships with animals and nature. Taking human interactions with protected wildlife as one aspect of these wider socio-environmental debates, this article builds on recent embodied, materialist and posthumanist research in applied linguistics to suggest that nexus analysis offers a holistic methodology to examine the problematic ways people become caught up with threatened species through their semiotic practices.

My inquiry here explores whether there exists anything comparably schematic to wedges and frames at work in attempts by American politicians not to polarize but to find consensus, not to cater to extremes but moderate them. Despite the seeming paucity of such efforts in American public discourse, there is one such common and as-yet untheorized scheme, which uses the two issue positions involved in wedges to overcome the ill effects of reframing and the two value dimensions involved in reframing to overcome the ill effects of wedges. I elaborate this discursive structure by examining its presence in a number of American political debates, showing how it differs from other contemporary normative-theoretic frameworks for understanding compromise in American politics.","[Stark, Andrew] Univ Toronto, Strateg Management & Polit Sci, Toronto, ON, Canada",,"Stark, A (corresponding author), Univ Toronto, Strateg Management & Polit Sci, Toronto, ON, Canada.",stark@rotman.utoronto.ca,,,,,,,102,0,0,3,7,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0003-0554,1537-5943,,AM POLIT SCI REV,Am.

A Theory of Goal-Dependent Political Evaluation,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,PARTISAN BIAS; OPINION; POLARIZATION,"Rather than exhibiting bias or open-minded reasoning at baseline, we argue that information processing is motivated by whatever goals a context makes salient. Thus, if politics feels like debate, people will be motivated to argue for their side. If politics feels like deliberation, they will be motivated to seek consensus through open-minded processing. Results from three experiments demonstrate: (1) Politics evokes thoughts similar to conflictual contexts and dissimilar from deliberative contexts. (2) Consequently, information labeled political primes the motivation to counterargue, leading to opinion polarization. Absent such labeling, no such motivation is evident, explaining why bias is common but not inherent to politics. (3) Despite this capacity for bias, people can be motivated to actively process and accept counterattitudinal information by simply making the value of open-mindedness salient. This suggests open-minded discourse is possible even absent motivation to evaluate information accurately. We conclude by discussing the implications of our research for political discourse.","[Groenendyk, Eric] Univ Memphis, Dept Polit Sci, 419 Clement Hall, Memphis, TN 38152 USA; [Krupnikov, Yanna] SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Polit Sci, S723 SBS, Stony Brook, NY 11790 USA",,"Groenendyk, E (corresponding author), Univ Memphis, Dept Polit Sci, 419 Clement Hall, Memphis, TN 38152 USA.",grnendyk@memphis.edu; yanna.krupnikov@stonybrook.edu,,,,,,,46,10,10,5,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0092-5853,1540-5907,,AM J POLIT SCI,Am.

While prior news diversity studies have contributed important theoretical insights, we argue here that scholarly knowledge of this concept can be significantly advanced by employing computational methods for text analysis. Using automated methods, researchers can increase both the scope of data being analyzed and the resolution of the analysis. This article presents a novel framework for analyzing news diversity consisting of two distinct stages. In the first stage, a computational text classification method is used to analyze, at a high resolution, the attention given in news texts to a broad range of political and social issues. In the second stage, the text classifications are aggregated, and the distributions of media attention to those issues (i.e., news diversity) are assessed on a large scale. After presenting the novel approach, we illustrate its usefulness for testing theoretical hypotheses about news diversity. We compare the diversity of economic coverage in three elite and three popular US newspapers (N= 252,807 articles) and find that a fine-grained analysis relaxes concerns raised in previous studies about low content diversity in the popular press.","[Amsalem, Eran] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Commun & Journalism, Jerusalem, Israel; [Fogel-Dror, Yair; Shenhav, Shaul R.] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Polit Sci, Jeruslaem, Israel; [Sheafer, Tamir] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Polit Sci & Commun & Journalism, Jerusalem, Israel",,"Amsalem, E (corresponding author), Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Commun & Journalism, Jerusalem, Israel.",eran.amsalem@mail.huji.ac.il,,"Sheafer, Tamir/0000-0002-9242-2264; Amsalem, Eran/0000-0002-3135-9775; Shenhav, Shaul/0000-0002-8820-3579",,,,,59,1,1,2,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1931-2458,1931-2466,,COMMUN METHODS MEAS,Commun.

By contrast, this article develops and tests the theory that certain forms of censorship-in particular, prohibitions on popular culture-serve not only to limit political information but also to reward dictators' supporters. Using text analysis of all 8,000 films reviewed for distribution during Chile's dictatorship, I demonstrate that rather than focusing only on sensitive political topics, censors banned movies containing content considered immoral. Through a combination of qualitative and quantitative evidence, I show that these patterns cannot be explained by masked political content, distributor self-censorship, or censor preferences. Instead, they reflect the regime's use of censorship as a reward for supporters, particularly conservative Catholic groups.

A total of 144 Spanish learners of English were tested on their recognition and recall knowledge of four word knowledge components: the form-meaning link, derivatives, multiple meanings, and collocations. All word knowledge components were strongly intercorrelated, and implicational scaling analyses showed that there is a consistent pattern of acquisition for these components, with recognition knowledge being acquired before recall knowledge across all the different components. Structural equation modelling (SEM) revealed that all components (both recognition and recall) contribute significantly to the global vocabulary construct. However, SEM also suggested that the recognition and recall masteries of any particular word knowledge component must be seen as separate constructs. Overall, findings suggest that the distinction between recognition and recall knowledge is fundamental to the conceptualization of the development of vocabulary knowledge.","[Gonzalez-fernandez, Beatriz] Univ Sheffield, Sch English, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England; [Schmitt, Norbert] Univ Nottingham, Sch English Studies, Nottingham, England",,"Gonzalez-fernandez, B (corresponding author), Univ Sheffield, Sch English, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England.;Schmitt, N (corresponding author), Univ Nottingham, Sch English Studies, Nottingham, England.",B.Gonzalez-Fernandez@sheffield.ac.uk; Norbert.Schmitt@nottingham.ac.uk,,,,,,,56,30,30,10,37,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0142-6001,1477-450X,,APPL LINGUIST,Appl.

In politics, people encounter representations of political candidates that combine images and text. Among the most prominent pieces of information people encounter are a candidate's gender, obtained from images of the candidate's face, and the candidate's partisan identification, often represented as text. This feature of the environment is important given previous work showing that individuals infer gender categories from faces rapidly and effortlessly. In this study (N = 113), we use eye movements to determine how individuals assign stereotypical policy positions to candidates in an environment in which photos of candidates' faces are paired with labels of their partisan IDs.

In contrast, political novices did not prioritize one type of stereotype over the other.

Most studies of policy diffusion-which is the process by which policymaking in one government affects policymaking in other governments-have focused on policy adoptions. We shift the focus to an important but neglected aspect of this process: the issue-definition stage. We use topic models to estimate how policies are framed during this stage and how these frames are predicted by prior policy adoptions. Focusing on smoking restriction in U.S. states, our analysis draws upon an original data set of over 52,000 paragraphs from newspapers covering 49 states between 1996 and 2013. We find that frames regarding the policy's concrete implications are predicted by prior adoptions in other states, whereas frames regarding its normative justifications are not. Our approach and findings open the way for a new perspective to studying policy diffusion in many different areas.","[Gilardi, Fabrizio] Univ Zurich, Dept Polit Sci, Policy Anal, Affolternstr 56, CH-8050 Zurich, Switzerland; [Shipan, Charles R.] Univ Michigan, Dept Polit Sci, Social Sci, 505 S State St, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Wuest, Bruno] Forschungsstelle Sotomo, Dolderstr 24, CH-8032 Zurich, Switzerland",,"Gilardi, F (corresponding author), Univ Zurich, Dept Polit Sci, Policy Anal, Affolternstr 56, CH-8050 Zurich, Switzerland.",gilardi@ipz.uzh.ch; bruno.wueest@sotomo.ch,"Gilardi, Fabrizio/AGF-1855-2022",,SwissNational Science Foundation [100017 150071/1],SwissNational Science Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)),"We thank Katrin Affolter, Nina Bader, Nina Buddeke, Sarah Dascher, Zander Furnas, Jeremy Gelman, Andrea Hauptli, Geoff Lorenz, Sabrina Luthi, Adriano Meyer, Blake Miller, Christian Muller, and Thomas Willi for excellent research assistance; Klaus Rotherhausler for technical assistance; Fridolin Linder for the evaluation of topic models and extrapolation of the diffusion network; and Jared Cory, James Cross, Marty Finnemore, Julian Garritzmann, TomGinsburg, JudeHays, Daniel Kubler, Mael Kubli, Michael Lerner, Katerina Linos, MartinoMaggetti, PaashaMahdavi, DanMallinson, SlavaMikhaylov, Ioannis Papadopoulos, Molly Roberts, Fritz Sager, Gijs Schumacher, Matia Vannoni, Craig Volden, Fabio Wasserfallen, Yuri Zhukov, and seminar participants at UC Berkeley, University College London, the University of Cologne, the University of Konstanz, the Institut Barcelona d'Estudis Internacionals (IBEI), the University of Bern, the University of Lausanne, the University ofMilan, the University of St. Gallen, the University of Strathclyde, and the University of Zurich for helpful comments.

This political communication style runs counter to deliberative democratic virtues such as respectful interactions and well-justified arguments. Its use is therefore problematic from a normative point of view, yet there are indications that it is an effective communication style to persuade citizens. Two survey experiments - text and audio - were developed to investigate the effects of uncivil communication and simplistic argumentation on political trust and on persuasive power in political election debates. The results show that 1) uncivil communication lowers political trust and is slightly less convincing than civil communication, 2) simplistic argumentation, i.e. political arguments presented in ill- or non-justified ways, does not affect political trust and is not more persuasive than well-justified argumentation, and 3) the strongest violation of social norms, i.e. a combined use of uncivil communication and simplistic argumentation, decreases both trust in the political candidate and persuasive power. Interestingly, politically cynical citizens and citizens who do not value inclusionary debates react differently to uncivil communication and simplistic argumentation: their level of trust does not decline and they are persuaded slightly more by simplistic arguments expressed in uncivil ways.","[Goovaerts, Ine; Marien, Sofie] Univ Leuven, Ctr Polit Sci Res, Pk Str 45,Box 3602, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium",,"Goovaerts, I (corresponding author), Univ Leuven, Ctr Polit Sci Res, Pk Str 45,Box 3602, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium.",ine.goovaerts@kuleuven.be,"Marien, Sofie/M-9247-2016","Marien, Sofie/0000-0002-3060-621X; Goovaerts, Ine/0000-0002-5893-4442",FWO Research Foundation Flanders [G068417N]; Internal Funds KU Leuven [C14/17/022],FWO Research Foundation Flanders(FWO); Internal Funds KU Leuven,This study was supported by a Project Grant from FWO Research Foundation Flanders (no.

Drawing on 71 interviews conducted during the Intifada of Individuals (2015), this article inductively builds theory about the relationship between social isolation and different modalities of resistance. Rather than forcing civilians to comply with the state, checkpoint apparatus instead change the nature and texture of resistance. I suggest that checkpoints structure social connections for civilians on the ground. Checkpoint apparatus which inhibit social connection engender a feeling of hopelessness and foster support for individual, often violent, resistance. Where checkpoints isolate a community as a whole but did not disrupt within-community social connections, citizens maintain hope for the possibility of change, which facilitates a preference for collective resistance. This article identifies troubling consequences checkpoints have on civilians and highlights how oppressive state power can limit some modalities of resistance only to engender support for others.","[Gade, Emily Kalah] Emory Univ, Polit Sci, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA",,"Gade, EK (corresponding author), Emory Univ, Polit Sci, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA.",emily.gade@emory.edu,,"Gade, Emily/0000-0002-9061-7869",Chester Fritz Boeing International Research Grant (UW); Ioan G.

A political landscape characterized by international consensus and compliance in the 1990s (as opposed to tariff wars and logistical nationalism) further buttressed this new ideology, leading to a newly multilingual centripetality in the global management of meaning. Based on historical examples and evidence from computational engineering, this article tracks the extraordinary growth of this sector and its implications for other arenas of language practice, implications that indude: monolingualization, securitization, dehistoricization, lexicaliztation, and the reduction of 'culture' to its most overt linguistic forms.","[Gramling, David] Univ Arizona, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA",,"Gramling, D (corresponding author), Univ Arizona, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA.",dgl@email.arizona.edu,,,,,,,63,3,3,1,15,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0142-6001,1477-450X,,APPL LINGUIST,Appl.

Yet, mothers also grapple with the demands of an unmarked global hearing culture, especially as their children's deafness becomes mediated by technology and medical intervention, under the guise of progress, social mobility, equity, and inclusion (Lane et al. 1996). Access to spoken English through technological aids supposedly 'solves' the perceived 'problem' of communication and cultural difference between mother and child. But what is at stake in this process of translation aided by new technologies? I take a critical discourse analytic approach to analyze videotaped interviews with six hearing mothers. Hearing mother interviewees displayed ambivalent shifts in footing, in particular, mode-switches, which, I argue, paralleled the ambiguous subject positions of their deaf children who they perceive as both deaf (without implants) and hearing (with implants). This study brings to light the complex role technology and 'cochlear implant culture' play in shaping an instrumentalized view of language with the objective of participating in local and global hearing culture.","[Johnson, Jennifer T.] Stanford Univ, Program Writing & Rhetor, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",,"Johnson, JT (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Program Writing & Rhetor, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",jennj@stanford.edu,,,,,,,51,0,0,2,10,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0142-6001,1477-450X,,APPL LINGUIST,Appl.

But what precisely counts as culture in the global workplace of the MNC? What does it exactly mean to be able to translate across cultures under the regimes of evaluation adopted by MNCs? In this article, I consider these questions through a discussion of the corporate discourse of diversity management, in which the cultural diversity of the workforce is understood as a resource for maximizing profit. Based on a critical review of diversity management literature and a study on Korean managers working for non-Korean MNCs in Singapore, I first show how diversity management's claim of openness and inclusivity actually works to reproduce unequal relations in the workplace. I then argue that attention to the politics of translation, where the ideological nature of evaluations of cultural (in)commensurability is highlighted, is needed for applied linguists' engagement with language and communication in the multicultural workplace.","[Park, Joseph Sung-Yul] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept English Language & Literature, Singapore, Singapore",,"Park, JSY (corresponding author), Natl Univ Singapore, Dept English Language & Literature, Singapore, Singapore.",ellpjs@nus.edu.sg,,"Park, Joseph Sung-Yul/0000-0003-2903-4813",,,,,40,3,3,4,23,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0142-6001,1477-450X,,APPL LINGUIST,Appl.

These resources are used in the management of turn and sequence and the marking of stance and affect, and they represent an aspect of the interactional machinery that is as elusive as it is powerful. Phenomena long assumed to be beyond the purview of linguistic inquiry emerge as systematically deployed practices whose ambiguous degree of control and convention allows participants to carry out subtle interactional work without committing to specific words. While these resources have been characterized as nonlexical, nonverbal, or nonconventional, I propose that they are unified in their liminality: They work well precisely because they equivocate between sound and speech.

I expect this to hold among copartisans who are exposed to party rhetoric. To test my argument, I measure moral rhetoric by text-analyzing party manifestos from six English-speaking democracies and measure mobilization using copartisan turnout in survey data. The results support my argument. Furthermore, I find evidence in support of the theoretical mechanism using survey experiments and panel survey data from Britain.

Fact-checking has a significantly positive overall influence on political beliefs (d = 0.29), but the effects gradually weaken when using truth scales, refuting only parts of a claim, and fact-checking campaign-related statements. Likewise, the ability to correct political misinformation with fact-checking is substantially attenuated by participants' preexisting beliefs, ideology, and knowledge.

However, in practice the hope that the dominant source of variation in their data is the quantity of interest is often not realized. In this paper, I argue that in the messy world of speeches we have to rely on supervised approaches that include information on party affiliation in order to produce meaningful estimates of polarization. To substantiate this argument, I introduce a validation framework that may be used to comparatively assess supervised and unsupervised methods, and estimate polarization on the basis of 6.2 million records of parliamentary speeches from the UK House of Commons over the period 1811-2015. Beyond introducing several important adjustments to existing estimation approaches, the paper's methodological contribution therefore consists of outlining the challenges of applying unsupervised estimation techniques to speech data, and arguing in detail why we should instead rely on supervised methods to measure polarization.","[Goet, Niels D.] Inspera AS, Oslo, Norway",,"Goet, ND (corresponding author), Inspera AS, Oslo, Norway.",ndgoet@gmail.com,"Goet, Niels/AAR-7137-2020","Goet, Niels/0000-0001-9937-0885",,,,,42,7,7,6,14,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1047-1987,1476-4989,,POLIT ANAL,Polit.

Additionally, we replicate and unpack our GRD analyses using three nationally representative samples of Latinos. Across multiple studies, we find that access to Spanish-language television is associated with decreases in turnout, ethnic civic participation, and political knowledge.

Spatial econometric techniques have been proposed to empirically model such interdependencies and to closely convert theoretical expectations into statistical models. Yet, these models often ignore that the parties' ideological positions are latent variables and, as such, accompanied by a quantifiable amount of uncertainty. As a result, the implausible assumption of perfectly measured covariates impedes a proper evaluation of theoretical propositions. In order to bridge this gap between theory and empirics, the present work combines a spatial econometric model and a Bayesian dynamic item response model. The proposed model accurately accounts for measurement uncertainty and simultaneously estimates the parties' ideological positions and their spatial interdependencies. To verify the model's utility, I apply it to recorded votes from the sixteen German state legislatures in the period from 1988 to 2016. While exhibiting a notable degree of ideological mobility, the results indicate only moderate spatial dependencies among parties of the same party family. More importantly, the analysis illustrates how measurement uncertainty can lead to substantively different results which stresses the importance of appropriately incorporating theoretical expectations into statistical models.","[Juhl, Sebastian] Univ Mannheim, Sonderforsch Bereich 884, B6,30-32,Room 337, D-68159 Mannheim, Baden Wurttembe, Germany",,"Juhl, S (corresponding author), Univ Mannheim, Sonderforsch Bereich 884, B6,30-32,Room 337, D-68159 Mannheim, Baden Wurttembe, Germany.",sebastian.juhl@gess.uni-mannheim.de,"Juhl, Sebastian/I-7239-2019","Juhl, Sebastian/0000-0002-7123-5398",German Research Foundation (DFG) [SFB 884]; University of Mannheim's Graduate School of Economic and Social Sciences (GESS),German Research Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)); University of Mannheim's Graduate School of Economic and Social Sciences (GESS),"An earlier version of this work has been presented at the EPSA conference 2017 in Milan, Italy and the 2018 annual conference of the PSA Political Methodology Group in Essex, UK.

The results of two experimental studies with U.S. adults (n = 210 and n = 630) suggest that political speeches can evoke elevation responses, and that such an elevation response is not affected by the political party of the speaker. An elevating response was associated with greater positivity toward politics and the speaker (Studies 1 and 2), as well as increased perceived closeness with one's own party and the opposing party (Study 2). Elevation was also associated with lower political cynicism. These outcomes further predicted both intentions to participate in the political process and information-seeking behavior. In a time when U.S. politics seem especially divided, elevation may represent one possible avenue for encouraging political discourse and participation.","[Ellithorpe, Morgan E.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Advertising & Publ Relat, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Huang, Yan] Univ Houston, Jack J Valenti Sch Commun, Houston, TX 77004 USA; [Oliver, Mary Beth] Penn State Univ, Coll Commun, University Pk, PA 16802 USA",,"Ellithorpe, ME (corresponding author), Michigan State Univ, Dept Advertising & Publ Relat, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",mellitho@msu.edu,,"Huang, Yan/0000-0001-7607-9585",,,,,55,2,2,2,14,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0021-9916,1460-2466,,J COMMUN,J.

These inconsistencies demonstrate that the mechanisms behind a potential bilingualism-to-EF relationship remain unclear. Multiple factors likely impact EF outcomes among bilinguals, including proficiency and extent and type and environment of language usage. The current study explored EF skills among a relatively homogeneous sample of 50 Spanish-English bilingual young adults to provide insights into the environmental and individual characteristics that contribute to EF diversity. Hierarchical regression modeling revealed that more balanced bilingual language usage in specific home-based tasks (particularly TV watching), and higher self-reported ability in Spanish and English significantly predicted higher EF. Results support the developing empirical consensus that greater engagement in dual-language contexts bears a positive relationship to EF. The finding that watching TV with a balanced language ratio has a significant positive relationship to EF opens strong potential opportunities for bilinguals to access EF benefits with minimal effort.","[Smith, Sara Ashley] Univ S Florida, Tampa, FL 33620 USA; [Briggs, Jessica G.] Univ Oxford, Oxford, England; [Pothier, Holly; Garcia, Jorge Nicholas, Jr.] Calif State Univ East Bay, Hayward, CA USA",,"Smith, SA (corresponding author), Univ S Florida, Tampa, FL 33620 USA.",sarasmith3@usf.edu,"Baffoe-Djan, Jessica Briggs/E-6611-2016","Baffoe-Djan, Jessica Briggs/0000-0002-5464-1490",,,,,58,2,2,2,8,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0142-6001,1477-450X,,APPL LINGUIST,Appl.

Leveraging a targeted survey of 2,070 island residents and distance to Turkey as an instrument, we find that direct exposure to refugee arrivals induces sizable and lasting increases in natives' hostility toward refugees, immigrants, and Muslim minorities; support for restrictive asylum and immigration policies; and political engagement to effect such exclusionary policies. Since refugees only passed through these islands, our findings challenge both standard economic and cultural explanations of anti-immigrant sentiment and show that mere exposure suffices in generating lasting increases in hostility.","[Hangartner, Dominik; Marbach, Moritz] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Ctr Comparat & Int Studies, Zurich, Switzerland; [Hangartner, Dominik] London Sch Econ, Dept Govt, London, England; [Dinas, Elias] European Univ Inst, Robert Schuman Ctr Adv Studies, Swiss Chair Federalism Democracy & Int Governance, Florence, Italy; [Dinas, Elias] European Univ Inst, Dept Social & Polit Sci, Florence, Italy; [Dinas, Elias] Univ Oxford, Dept Polit & Int Relat, Oxford, England; [Matakos, Konstantinos] Kings Coll London, Dept Polit Econ, London, England; [Xefteris, Dimitrios] Univ Cyprus, Dept Econ, Nicosia, Cyprus",,"Hangartner, D (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Ctr Comparat & Int Studies, Zurich, Switzerland.;Hangartner, D (corresponding author), London Sch Econ, Dept Govt, London, England.",d.hangartner@lse.ac.uk; elias.dinas@eui.eu; moritz.marbach@gess.ethz.ch; konstantinos.matakos@kcl.ac.uk; xefteris.dimitrios@ucy.ac.cy,"; Xefteris, Dimitrios/S-4080-2017","Matakos, Konstantinos/0000-0002-3511-197X; Xefteris, Dimitrios/0000-0001-7397-5288",British Academy for a Small Leverhulme Grant [CTR00340]; Leverhulme Trust,British Academy for a Small Leverhulme Grant; Leverhulme Trust(Leverhulme Trust),"The survey was fielded by the Survey Unit of the University of Macedonia according to our sampling frame and in line with the ethics policy of the London School of Economics and Political Science for human subjects research.

This research demonstrates how the (transnational) identities of these two students were discursively and iteratively formed based on complex intersections of national and transnational discourses regarding the representations of overseas returnees and the students' conceptions and co-constructions of the legitimate academic transnational and home.

The data show a dramatic increase in the frequency with which PC-phrases are used in the early 1990s. From this time onwards, the phrases are often used as a means of passing evaluative subjective opinions off as objectively reported facts, especially in reviews of cultural events, where they figure prominently. In contrast to earlier studies, our data show that PC-phrases are not inherently negative; this applies primarily to discourse on environment and business, where to be PC often implies being environmentally or socially conscious in a positive sense. Nevertheless, negative or ironic uses of the terms predominate. Most often they express criticism of unspoken cultural norms rather than being attempts to close down debate or criticizing the replacement of offensive terms by more neutral expressions.","[Granath, Solveig; Ullen, Magnus] Karlstad Univ, Dept Language Literature & Intercultural Studies, Univ Gatan 1, SE-65188 Karlstad, Sweden",,"Granath, S (corresponding author), Karlstad Univ, Dept Language Literature & Intercultural Studies, Univ Gatan 1, SE-65188 Karlstad, Sweden.",solveig.granath@kau.se,,,,,,,30,1,1,1,22,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0142-6001,1477-450X,,APPL LINGUIST,Appl.

However, there is little consensus on the interpretation of this correlation: is it causal or is it an artifact of selection bias? We address this question by exploiting six major compulsory schooling reforms in five Western European countries-Denmark, France, Great Britain, the Netherlands, and Sweden-that have recently experienced politically influential anti-immigration movements. On average, we find that compelling students to remain in secondary school for at least an additional year decreases anti-immigration attitudes later in life. Instrumental variable estimates demonstrate that, among such compliers, an additional year of secondary schooling substantially reduces the probability of opposing immigration, believing that immigration erodes a country's quality of life, and feeling close to far-right anti-immigration parties. These results suggest that rising post-war educational attainment has mitigated the rise of anti-immigration movements. We discuss the mechanisms and implications for future research examining anti-immigration sentiment.","[Cavaille, Charlotte] Georgetown Univ, Sch Foreign Serv, Washington, DC 20057 USA; [Marshall, John] Columbia Univ, Dept Polit Sci, New York, NY 10027 USA",,"Cavaille, C (corresponding author), Georgetown Univ, Sch Foreign Serv, Washington, DC 20057 USA.",cc1933@georgetown.edu; jm4401@columbia.edu,,,,,,,18,39,39,0,21,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0003-0554,1537-5943,,AM POLIT SCI REV,Am.

In the study, biliteracy was operationalized as reading proficiency and vocabulary knowledge in two languages, which was tested with measures of word decoding, reading comprehension, and vocabulary breadth and depth. The study was designed to allow for cross-sectional, longitudinal, and cross-linguistic analyses of data. Overall, the results showed that participation in MTI contributed positively to participants' results on Somali reading comprehension, beyond the influence of chronological age, age of arrival, and reported home language and literacy use. Furthermore, higher results in Somali were associated with higher results on the same measures in Swedish, in particular for the reading measures.

Sixteen data journalists working in Arab nations were identified through multiple inquiries and a snowball sample that achieved saturation. Informants described data journalism as the careful analysis of numerical evidence to provide credible and sometimes visual information to audiences on subjects otherwise off limits and which aligns journalists with perceived global professional standards. Four types of barriers emerged: two structural (insufficient data access and social/political expectations) and two individualistic (ignorance and resistance). Combined, those barriers affirm journalistic role conception research and the value of metajournalistic discourse theory to reveal that the fundamental obstacle in the region is not a paucity of data but the ontological limitation of the dominant loyal-facilitator role.","[Lewis, Norman P.] Univ Florida, Dept Journalism, Gainesville, FL USA; [Al Nashmi, Eisa] Kuwait Univ, Dept Mass Commun, Kuwait, Kuwait",,"Lewis, NP (corresponding author), Univ Florida, Dept Journalism, Gainesville, FL USA.",nplewis@ufl.edu,,,,,,,86,10,10,1,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

Participants (N=138, aged 9-11) received explicit information followed by either task-essential practice in making form-meaning connections (referential activities from Processing Instruction) OR task-essential practice in spotting the form (word noticing activities). Both interventions yielded equivalent durable gains across six ecologically valid tests of comprehension and production (written and oral modalities), compared to no gains in a control group. The findings revealed that, following explicit information, input practice requiring engagement with the target feature (as proposed by Svalberg 2012) was equally effective as task-essential form-meaning connection practice, shedding important light on previous claims in the research agenda on task-essential input practice (Marsden 2006; Marsden and Chen 2011). Responding to calls for ecologically valid effect-of-instruction research (Mitchell 2000; Spada 2015), this classroom study demonstrates the efficacy of grammar practice for young learners within input-poor foreign language classrooms.","[Kasprowicz, Rowena] Univ York, Digital Creat Labs, York, N Yorkshire, England; [Marsden, Emma] Univ York, Dept Educ, Ctr Res Language Learning & Use, York, N Yorkshire, England",,"Kasprowicz, R (corresponding author), Univ York, Digital Creat Labs, York, N Yorkshire, England.",rowena.kasprowicz@york.ac.uk,,,ESRC PhD studentship; EPSRC [EP/M023265/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [1074295] Funding Source: researchfish; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/M023265/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC PhD studentship(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),"All intervention and test materials are freely available at www.iris-database.org.

This article argues that the news media can serve as one channel for governments to favor domestic industries. Focusing on media coverage of auto recalls in China, I reveal a systematic bias against foreign automakers in those newspapers under strict government control. I further analyze subnational reporting patterns, exploiting variation in the level of regional government interest in the automobile industry. The analysis suggests that the media's home bias is driven by the government's protectionist interests but rules out the alternative hypothesis that home bias simply reflects the nationalist sentiment of readers. I show that this home bias in news coverage has meaningful impact on actual consumer behavior, combining automobile sales data and information on recall-related web searches.","[Kim, Sung Eun] Korea Univ, Dept Polit Sci & Int Relat, Polit Sci, 145 Anam Ro, Seoul 02841, South Korea",,"Kim, SE (corresponding author), Korea Univ, Dept Polit Sci & Int Relat, Polit Sci, 145 Anam Ro, Seoul 02841, South Korea.",sung_kim@korea.edu,"Kim, Sung Eun/AAY-1989-2021","Kim, Sung Eun/0000-0001-6799-4343",,,,,27,8,8,1,30,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0003-0554,1537-5943,,AM POLIT SCI REV,Am.

Seeing dispositions as the key to professionalization and professional contributions, it explores the possibilities and challenges in harnessing the professional value of their transnational disposition. Semi-structured interviews were conducted to investigate the participants' position in the workplace, negotiations of the local curriculum and classroom practice, and professional interactions with colleagues and parents. The findings show that these teachers actively respond to invisibility and marginalization by drawing from their transcultural disposition to creatively but cautiously transform pedagogical practices and discourses. It is found that the presence of migrant professionals in local context provides opportunities for critical reflexivity and transnational awareness among local professionals. It is implied that the changes in thinking and awareness may lead to broad-based ideological and structural changes, which in turn promotes productive knowledge exchange.","[Gu, Michelle Mingyue] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Fac Educ, Dept Curriculum & Instruct, Shatin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Canagarajah, Suresh] Penn State Univ, Dept Appl Linguist, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Canagarajah, Suresh] Penn State Univ, Dept English, University Pk, PA 16802 USA",,"Gu, MM (corresponding author), Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Fac Educ, Dept Curriculum & Instruct, Shatin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",moongu1009@gmail.com,,,Worldwide Universities Network; Chinese University of Hong Kong,Worldwide Universities Network; Chinese University of Hong Kong(Chinese University of Hong Kong),"We are grateful to the Editors, and Reviewers for their constructive feedback on an earlier version of the manuscript, and to Professor Adrian Bailey for his valuable comments on research design of the study.

This analysis draws upon a data from middle school classrooms in the South Atlantic region of the USA and focuses particularly on the classroom experiences of six 6th-grade students classified as 'English learners' who have been in US schools since kindergarten. We use a multiple case study approach (Stake 2006) to analyze qualitative classroom observations completed in 'mainstream' classrooms alongside teacher and student interviews to examine the extent to which classroom-based peer and teacher-student interactions offer opportunities for language acquisition/development. Varied patterns of engagement and interaction were found, but most students had relatively few substantive academic discussions with peers or teachers. The diversity of our six students' experiences, and of the language expertise they demonstrate, suggests that 'LTEL' obscures more than it elucidates regarding these students' academic and linguistic strengths and needs.","[Kibler, Amanda K.; Bergey, Rebecca; Wang, Chenyu; Elreda, Lauren Molloy] Univ Virginia, Curry Sch Educ, Charlottesville, VA 22904 USA; [Karam, Fares J.] Univ Reno, Coll Educ, Nevada, NV 89577 USA; [Ehrlich, Valerie A.

The procedure adopted in traditional word association tasks does not guarantee that this is the case.

But while a useful tool in revealing something of the dynamic interactions which underlie persuasive claim making, it has little to say about the role of nouns in this process. We address this gap by exploring the rhetorical functions of what we call metadiscursive nouns (such as fact, analysis, belief) and by mapping them onto a model of metadiscourse. The study examines 'metadiscursive noun + post-nominal clause' patterns, one of the most frequent structures containing such nouns, in a corpus of 120 research articles across six disciplines. Developing a rhetorically based classification and exploring the interactive and interactional use of metadiscursive nouns, we show that they are another key element of metadiscourse, offering writers a way of organizing discourse into a cohesive flow of information and of constructing a stance towards it. These interactions are further shown to realize the epistemological assumptions and rhetorical practices of particular disciplines.","[Jiang, Feng (Kevin); Hyland, Ken] Univ Hong Kong, Ctr Appl English Studies, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",,"Jiang, F (corresponding author), Univ Hong Kong, Ctr Appl English Studies, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",kevinjiang@hku.hk,"Jiang, Kevin/AAT-5052-2021; Hyland, Ken/ABH-8176-2020","Jiang, Kevin/0000-0001-7369-9498",,,,,46,36,37,22,118,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0142-6001,1477-450X,,APPL LINGUIST,Appl.

Using a novel linguistic technique to assess personality from unscripted text spoken by 2,381 CEOs of S&P 1500 firms over ten years, we show that CEOs' extraversion influences the merger and acquisition (M&A) behavior of firms above and beyond other well-established personality traits. We find that extraverted CEOs are more likely to engage in acquisitions, and to conduct larger ones, than other CEOs and that these effects are partially explained by their higher representation on boards of other firms. Moreover, we find that the acquisitive nature of extraverted CEOs reveals itself particularly in so-called weaker'' situations, in which CEOs enjoy considerable discretion to behave in ways akin to their personality traits. Subsequent analyses show that extraverted CEOs are also more likely than other CEOs to succeed in M&As, as reflected by stronger abnormal returns following acquisition announcements.","[Malhotra, Shavin] Univ Waterloo, Fac Engn, Conrad Business Entrepreneurship & Technol Ctr, 200 Univ Ave W, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada; [Reus, Taco H.] Erasmus Univ, Rotterdam Sch Management, Global Strategy, Burgemeester Oudlaan 50,Bayle Bldg, NL-3062 Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Roelofsen, Erik M.] Erasmus Univ, Rotterdam Sch Management, Int Financial Reporting & Capital Market Commun, Burgemeester Oudlaan 50,Bayle Bldg, NL-3062 Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Zhu, PengCheng] Univ San Diego, Sch Business Adm, Finance, 5998 Alcala Pk, San Diego, CA 92110 USA",,"Malhotra, S (corresponding author), Univ Waterloo, Fac Engn, Conrad Business Entrepreneurship & Technol Ctr, 200 Univ Ave W, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada.",shavin.malhotra@uwaterloo.ca; treus@rsm.nl; pzhu@sandiego.edu; eroelofsen@rsm.nl,,"Reus, Taco/0000-0003-2485-7730; Zhu, PengCheng/0000-0002-8360-2327",Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada,Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),"We thank Associate Editor Martin Kilduff and the three anonymous reviewers for their valuable and developmental feedback, and Govert Buijs, Harold Kokke, Magdalena Langosch, Jil Kratz, and Beata Matuszewska for their help in this study.

We take advantage of parallel advertisements produced in both English and Spanish by real candidates for national officeone presidential and two congressional. Because our design holds constant candidates' policy positions, we can attribute the effects on vote choice directly to the choice of language over and above other candidate attributes.

We find the opposite pattern of results among English-speaking monolingual Americans, who respond very negatively to Spanish-language advertisements.

This article, based on a longitudinal case study of metajournalistic discourse around the Center for Public Integrity, one of the oldest and largest news nonprofits in the United States, finds the Center engaging instead in what I have called boundary evolution, starting out self-consciously outside of journalism, and gradually working its way in. This insight helps us understand the power that marginal players wield in positioning themselves relative to larger participants. It also points to how players can evolve against the background of a changing ecology; in this case, the Center for Public Integrity came to see a place for itself in journalism only after funding cuts left news organizations hungry for quality, free content, and the digital environment normalized sharing.","[Konieczna, Magda] Temple Univ, Klein Coll, Dept Journalism, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA",,"Konieczna, M (corresponding author), Temple Univ, Klein Coll, Dept Journalism, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA.",magda@temple.edu,,"Konieczna, Magda/0000-0002-1597-8656",,,,,44,1,1,1,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

J,"Peterson, A; Spirling, A",,,,"Peterson, Andrew; Spirling, Arthur",,,Classification Accuracy as a Substantive Quantity of Interest: Measuring Polarization in Westminster Systems,POLITICAL ANALYSIS,,,English,Article,,,,,,statistical analysis of texts; polarization; learning,,"Measuring the polarization of legislators and parties is a key step in understanding how politics develops over time. But in parliamentary systems-where ideological positions estimated from roll calls may not be informative-producing valid estimates is extremely challenging. We suggest a new measurement strategy that makes innovative use of the accuracy of machine classifiers, i.e., the number of correct predictions made as a proportion of all predictions. In our case, the labels are the party identifications of the members of parliament, predicted from their speeches along with some information on debate subjects. Intuitively, when the learner is able to discriminate members in the two main Westminster parties well, we claim we are in a period of high polarization. By contrast, when the classifier has low accuracy-and makes a relatively large number of mistakes in terms of allocating members to parties based on the data-we argue parliament is in an era of low polarization. This approach is fast and substantively valid, and we demonstrate its merits with simulations, and by comparing the estimates from 7 8 years of House of Commons speeches with qualitativeand quantitative historical accounts of the same. As a headline finding, wenote that contemporary British politics is approximately as polarized as itwas in the mid-1960s-that is, in the middle of the postwar consensus. More broadly, we show that the technical performance of supervised learning algorithms can be directly informative about substantive matters in social science.","[Peterson, Andrew] Univ Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland; [Spirling, Arthur] NYU, Polit & Data Sci, New York, NY 10003 USA",,"Peterson, A (corresponding author), Univ Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland.",andrew.peterson@unige.ch; arthur.spirling@nyu.edu,,,,,,,28,23,24,0,8,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1047-1987,1476-4989,,POLIT ANAL,Polit.

The results indicate that self-identified conservatives doubt global warming in large part because of elite rhetoric, but that evolution beliefs are unrelated to reception of political discourse. News reception is perhaps the strongest predictor of conservatives' climate change skepticism, but has no influence on their aversion to evolution. Moreover, the article leverages three sources of variation in elite discourse on climate changetemporal, cross-national, and experimentalto show that changes in the prevalence of ideological cues strongly affect public opinion about global warming. Politically attentive conservatives, in fact, were more likely to believe scientists about global warming than liberals were in the 1990s before the media depicted climate change as a partisan issue. The United States is also the only nation where political interest significantly predicts both conservatives' skepticism about, and liberals' belief in, climate change. Finally, evidence from a national survey experiment suggests that Americans would be less skeptical of manmade global warming if more Republicans in Congress believed in it, but a growing Congressional consensus about evolution would not diminish doubts about its existence.","[Tesler, Michael] Univ Calif Irvine, Polit Sci, 3151 Social Sci Plaza, Irvine, CA 92697 USA",,"Tesler, M (corresponding author), Univ Calif Irvine, Polit Sci, 3151 Social Sci Plaza, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.",mtesler@uci.edu,,,,,,,54,44,44,3,31,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1058-4609,1091-7675,,POLIT COMMUN,Polit.

This paper explores whether these changes have weakened the basis of journalistic legitimacy, or have offered new grounds for journalistic legitimacy, and, in each case, to what extent. It is argued that a number of factors, including the financial difficulties of news media, the decentralisation of public communication as facilitated by the internet, the dual dilemmas faced by both objective and partisan journalism, and the belligerent public discourse about journalism are delegitimising journalism. However, the legitimatisation of journalism can be found in the efforts of news organisations-not only leading news organisations such as the Guardian and the New York Times but also regional and local ones such as the Trinity Mirror group and the Palm Beach Post-in adopting and possessing digital and technological tools and skills, and in defending their journalism. The relegitimation of journalism reiterates and reinforces the historically shaped essence of journalism that reflects a continuity of legacy journalism; and this is an organisational and occupational response to, and boundary defence against, the trend of delegitimation of journalism in the digital era.","[Tong, Jingrong] Brunel Univ London, Dept Social & Polit Sci, London, England",,"Tong, JR (corresponding author), Brunel Univ London, Dept Social & Polit Sci, London, England.",jingrong.tong@brunel.ac.uk,,,,,,,81,23,23,1,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

However, journalists have become frustrated with commenters who use forums to attack and make assertions. As journalists look for ways to reign in commenters, it becomes important to consider how journalists make decisions about moderation policies and practices. This study used gatekeeping theory to consider how one organization approached moderation and related issues of content management. The researcher conducted a one-month ethnography of a large news organization and their online forums and discovered that journalists set high expectations of commenters, but willingly accept low-quality content. Journalists appear to struggle with how to institute policies that promote high-quality discourse without engaging in intense battles with the audience and having to devote more resources to moderation. Journalists focus on establishing balance between allowing the audience to have a conversation without allowing that conversation to disrupt the traditional practices of journalism.","[Wolfgang, J.

They posit partisanship as a fundamentally democratic practice and develop a model of what partisans can do at their best to contribute to liberal democracy. However, the standards the literature puts forth remain insufficiently specified to serve as empirical benchmarks. This article further conceptualizes this model of democratic partisanship and offers a theoretical framework within which to empirically evaluate the democratic merits of partisan discourses. It establishes a series of indicators for assessing the extent to which partisan discourse displays two main qualities: cohesiveness and respect for political pluralism. The article then discusses the implications of using this theoretical framework as a basis for empirical studies and shows how the model can thereby benefit both political scientists and theorists.","[Herman, Lise Esther] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, London, England; [Herman, Lise Esther] Sci Po Paris, Polit Sci, 28 Rue St Peres, Paris, France",,"Herman, LE (corresponding author), London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, London, England.;Herman, LE (corresponding author), Sci Po Paris, Polit Sci, 28 Rue St Peres, Paris, France.",lise.herman@sciencespo.fr,,"Herman, Lise/0000-0001-9796-5922",,,,,117,11,11,0,14,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0003-0554,1537-5943,,AM POLIT SCI REV,Am.

By grammatically conflating today and tomorrow, we hypothesize that speakers of futureless tongues will view the future as temporally closer to the present, causing them to discount the future less and support future-oriented policies more. Using an original survey experiment that randomly assigned the interview language to Estonian/Russian bilinguals, we find support for this proposition and document the absence of this language effect when a policy has no obvious time referent. We then replicate and extend our principal result through a cross-national analysis of survey data. Our results imply that language may have significant consequences for mass opinion.","[Perez, Efren O.] Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Commons Ctr PMB 0505, 230 Appleton Pl, Nashville, TN 37203 USA; [Tavits, Margit] Washington Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Campus Box 1063,One Brookings Dr, St Louis, MO 63130 USA",,"Perez, EO (corresponding author), Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Commons Ctr PMB 0505, 230 Appleton Pl, Nashville, TN 37203 USA.",efren.o.perez@vanderbilt.edu; tavits@wustl.edu,,,"Weidenbaum Center on the Economy, Government, and Public Policy; Center for New Institutional Social Science","Weidenbaum Center on the Economy, Government, and Public Policy; Center for New Institutional Social Science","We would like to thank Michael Bechtel, Chris Karpowitz, Kristin Michelitch, and Cecilia Mo for incisive comments and constructive feedback on this project.

Intermediate to advanced adult ESL learners (N = 33) participated in the study. They completed four picture-based narrative tasks under the two planning conditions over a two-week period via text-chat. Two tasks were used as experimental tasks to gauge immediate planning effect on L2 production and the other two as new tasks to gauge L2 development. Results showed that both types of planning condition supported immediate production complexity but the ROP condition was more effective in leading to more accurate use of grammatical verb forms. With regard to the subsequent development of production complexity and accuracy, the ROP condition was more effective in leading to improvement on clausal complexity as well as control over the use of grammatical verb forms and avoidance of general errors.","[Hsu, Hsiu-Chen] Chung Yuan Christian Univ, Dept Appl Linguist & Language Studies, 200 Chung Pei Rd, Taoyuan 32023, Taiwan",,"Hsu, HC (corresponding author), Chung Yuan Christian Univ, Dept Appl Linguist & Language Studies, 200 Chung Pei Rd, Taoyuan 32023, Taiwan.",hsiuchen.hsu@cycu.edu.tw,"Hsu, Hsiu-Chen/AAT-1032-2020","Hsu, Hsiu-Chen/0000-0001-8114-074X",,,,,67,6,6,0,17,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0142-6001,1477-450X,,APPL LINGUIST,Appl.

In the classroom, L2 users are typically and primarily labeled 'learners', whereas beyond the classroom, 'in the wild' to borrow a term from Hutchins (1995), any aspect of their identity might take prominence (Firth and Wagner 1997). Drawing on data sets from classroom and non-classroom settings, this article shows two examples of the interactional work that goes into preparing for learning and how the ensuing learning/teaching activities are carried out. In both cases, participants co-construct learning/teaching spaces; the article shows how the two contexts call on different resources to accomplish this. Moreover, the actual learning sequences in interaction, framed around repair activities, are different in the two contexts; in the wild, the learning space is more condensed, embedded in the business-doing of the service encounter, whereas in class the activities are more extensive, the consequentiality is relaxed as speakers easily refer back to previous repair work and word searches, and they draw on writing and reading to an extent arguably rarely possible in non-classroom contexts.","[Eskildsen, Soren W.] Univ Southern Denmark, Dept Design & Commun, Odense, Denmark; [Theodorsdottir, Gudrun] Univ Iceland, Fac Iceland & Comparat Cultural Studies, Sch Humanities, Reykjavik, Iceland",,"Eskildsen, SW (corresponding author), Univ Southern Denmark, Dept Design & Commun, Odense, Denmark.;Theodorsdottir, G (corresponding author), Univ Iceland, Fac Iceland & Comparat Cultural Studies, Sch Humanities, Reykjavik, Iceland.",swe@sdu.dk; gt@hi.is,,"Eskildsen, Soren Wind/0000-0003-2432-9161",,,,,49,28,28,0,35,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0142-6001,1477-450X,,APPL LINGUIST,Appl.

Machiavelli demonstrates that, in particular, Giano della Bella and Michele di Lando could and should have attempted to imitate exemplary ancient founders and reformers whom he praises in previous works, especially Moses, Romulus, and Brutus. Machiavelli implicitly criticizes Giano and Michele for failing to spiritedly invigorate new laws with necessary and salutary violence; for neglecting to effectively manage the envy of rival peers; for not resisting the allure of middle ways between difficult political choices; and for failing to militarily organize or mobilize the entirety of Florence's common people.","[Mccormick, John P.] Univ Chicago, Polit Sci, 5828 So.

To unveil the plenary agenda and detect latent themes in legislative speeches over time, MEP speech content is analyzed using a new dynamic topic modeling method based on two layers of Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF). This method is applied to a new corpus of all English language legislative speeches in the EP plenary from the period 1999 to 2014. Our findings suggest that two-layer NMF is a valuable alternative to existing dynamic topic modeling approaches found in the literature, and can unveil niche topics and associated vocabularies not captured by existing methods. Substantively, our findings suggest that the political agenda of the EP evolves significantly over time and reacts to exogenous events such as EU Treaty referenda and the emergence of the Euro Crisis.

A few days later, on May 17, the Washington Post revealed that the Department of Justice had also been tracking the activities of Fox News' chief Washington correspondent, James Rosen. These two stories caused large scandals in the United States, and the majority of American journalists denounced the surveillance. As these scandals were still unfolding, yet another government surveillance scandal broke: former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden revealed that the federal government had been collecting the cell phone metadata of American citizens for several years. Journalists' responses to this scandal were more nuanced; editorials expressed a wider spectrum of views about the ethics of government surveillance practices, and more complex opinions about the legitimacy and necessity of government surveillance. Drawing on approaches to journalistic professionalism, this study uses qualitative textual analysis to assess editorials written in response to these three revelations. The analysis suggests that journalists see their speech as something deserving of unique protections, above and beyond those protections afforded to the general public.","[Johnson, Courtney N.] Univ Washington, Dept Commun, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",,"Johnson, CN (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Dept Commun, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",cnj3@uw.edu,,,,,,,40,2,2,1,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

The Dutch are described as holding an indifferent stance towards privacy in the aftermath of Snowden's revelations of far-reaching government surveillance. But are Dutch reactions as aloof as often claimed? This study provides an in-depth overview of privacy attitudes in the Dutch debate about the National Security Agency (NSA) leaks, showing a greater variety of sentiments than anticipated. A qualitative frame analysis and a quantitative descriptive analysis resulted in six frames, which convey distinct privacy attitudes. Online and offline as well as professional and non-journalistic content in the debate displays a different distribution of frames. The frames, ranging from an End justifies the means attitude to an anxious fear of an Orwellian dystopia, are placed in a larger framework as the research demonstrates the connection to existing theories about privacy and surveillance. Dutch discussions about the NSA revelations often display a trade-off narrative balancing safety against privacy, and include (de)legitimisation strategies. These outcomes are in line with previous studies about mediated surveillance debates, which indicates that privacy attitudes transcend national boundaries. However, the inclusion of user-generated content adds an individual dimension to the existing body of research and reveals a personal perspective on surveillance issues.","[Mols, Anouk; Janssen, Susanne] Erasmus Univ, Dept Media & Commun, Erasmus Sch Hist Culture & Commun, Rotterdam, Netherlands",,"Mols, A (corresponding author), Erasmus Univ, Dept Media & Commun, Erasmus Sch Hist Culture & Commun, Rotterdam, Netherlands.",mols@eshcc.eur.nl; s.janssen@eshcc.eur.nl,"Janssen, Susanne/C-7438-2011","Janssen, Susanne/0000-0002-8984-3498; Mols, Anouk/0000-0003-0355-9849",,,,,54,7,7,0,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

Drawing on theories from social psychology, I outline and test a set of theoretical predictions to explore this relationship in the context of Spanish-language political ads. The results suggest that Spanish-language political ads do, in fact, increase perceptions of collective political power among Latinos, but not in a way that unequivocally promote perceptions of political homogeneity.

A survey-experiment with a quota sample of 471 participants reveals that, overall, symbolic threat appeals exert stronger effects on anti-immigrant attitudes than economic ones. When presented via text alone, only symbolicnot economicthreat appeals increased anti-immigrant attitudes via the activation of heuristic processing such as the reliance on negative stereotypes or feelings of anxiety, in particular among lower-educated citizens. When visuals were present, both types of threat appeals enhanced anti-immigrant attitudes among citizens across all education levels based on heuristic processing.

A close reading of the two campaigns with a special focus on organizers' and participants' choice of frames, narratives, and iconography reveals how privacy activists have tried to exploit the political opportunity structures of the Snowden leaks and receive media attention. Through the use of historical, cultural, and global framing devices, as well as a particular focus on the actions of individual celebrity activists, organizers have sought to mobilize the public against surveillance. As a thorough look at the subsequent media coverage of the campaigns reveals, the framing activities opened discursive spaces in the contemporary debate about the effects and consequences of mass surveillance.

On the one hand, we suggest, media coverage contributes to normalizing surveillance by emphasizing concerns about national security and stressing the surveillance of elites, to the detriment of an interest in the gathering of bulk data on populations. On the other hand, journalists, though acknowledging national security concerns, are frequently critical of and resistant to the extent, nature and necessity of mass surveillance.

They prefer to act in accordance with the political conception of justice, but only if they are assured that others will. On Paul Weithman's influential interpretation, Rawls attempts to solve this problem by claiming that public reason is an assurance mechanism. There are several problems with Rawls's solution: Public reason talk is too cheap to facilitate assurance, it is difficult to know when particular utterances express public reasons, and the requirements of public reason conflict with the fact of reasonable pluralism. We argue that convergence discourse-not public reason-solves the assurance problem by being a costly signal that indicates commitment to the political conception. This solution has none of Rawls's problems and has an interesting corollary: As diversity increases in society, so too does society's ability to solve the assurance problem.

Second, we use latent class analysis to explore heterogeneity, partitioning the sample into classes characterized by distinctive patterns of attitudes. Conventional distinctions between ethnocultural and civic nationalism describe just about half of the U.S. population and do not account for the unexpectedly low levels of national pride found among respondents who hold restrictive definitions of American nationhood. A subset of primarily younger and well-educated Americans lacks any strong form of patriotic sentiment; a larger class, primarily older and less well educated, embraces every form of nationalist sentiment. Controlling for sociodemographic characteristics and partisan identification, these classes vary significantly in attitudes toward ethnic minorities, immigration, and national sovereignty. Finally, using comparable data from 1996 and 2012, we find structural continuity and distributional change in national sentiments over a period marked by terrorist attacks, war, economic crisis, and political contention.","[Bonikowski, Bart] Harvard Univ, Sociol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [DiMaggio, Paul] NYU, Sociol, New York, NY 10003 USA",,"Bonikowski, B (corresponding author), Harvard Univ, Dept Sociol, 636 William James Hall, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",bonikowski@fas.harvard.edu,,,Russell Sage Foundation,Russell Sage Foundation,The research was supported by a grant from the Russell Sage Foundation.,,90,126,127,16,96,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0003-1224,1939-8271,,AM SOCIOL REV,Am.

To resist unwanted riders, presidents have increasingly resorted to veto threats. Are such threats credible, and do they influence legislation? To answer these questions, we analyze the legislative histories of hundreds of threatened and unthreatened riders from 1985 through 2008. We find that threats are effective in bringing the final legislation closer to the president's preferences. Threats achieve their success, in large part, by interrupting the textbook legislative process in the Senate-spawning filibusters, prompting leaders to punt bills to conference, and encouraging the use of other unorthodox procedures. Unlike conventional models that regard veto threats as minimally effective, the findings presented here depict veto rhetoric as integral to identifying critical riders separating the legislative parties that must be resolved in order to avoid gridlock and pass annual appropriations legislation.","[Hassell, Hans J.

Arguing that hegemony operates around producer-provider norms of masculinity and through tropes of blackness within a system of racial capitalism, I show how complicity underscores the reality of differential aspirational models in the context of severe un- and underemployment and the failure of the classic breadwinner model for black men globally. I draw on participant observation fieldwork and interviews with men from Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire's informal sector from 2008 to 2009. I investigate two groups of men: political propagandists (orators) for former President Laurent Gbagbo and mobile street vendors. Rejecting racialized colonial narratives that positioned salaried workers as evolved, orators used anti-French rhetoric and ties to the political regime to pursue entrepreneurial identities. Vendors, positioned as illegitimate workers and non-citizens, asserted consumerist models of masculinity from global black popular culture. I show how entrepreneurialism and consumerism, the two paradigmatic neoliberal identities, have become ways for black men to assert economic participation as alternatives to the producer-provider ideal.","[Matlon, Jordanna] Amer Univ, Sch Int Serv, 4400 Massachussetts Ave NW, Washington, DC 20016 USA",,"Matlon, J (corresponding author), Amer Univ, Sch Int Serv, 4400 Massachussetts Ave NW, Washington, DC 20016 USA.",jcmatlon@american.edu,,,U.S. Department of Education; National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship; UC-Berkeley Fall Research Grant; UC-Berkeley Institute of International Studies Simpson Award; UC Dissertation-Year Fellowship; Agence Nationale de la Recherche-Labex IAST,U.S. Department of Education(US Department of Education); National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship(National Science Foundation (NSF)); UC-Berkeley Fall Research Grant; UC-Berkeley Institute of International Studies Simpson Award; UC Dissertation-Year Fellowship; Agence Nationale de la Recherche-Labex IAST(French National Research Agency (ANR)),"This research was completed with the generous support of the U.S. Department of Education Jacob K.

This study examines one consequence of sound-bite journalism: the creation of incomplete argument, in which speakers presenting their political position in the news do not also justify it. Drawing on data about television news in Germany, Russia, and the United States, it shows that shrinking sound bites consistently reduce the probability of opinion justification across widely differing national contexts.

While it is generally accepted that there are value differences between Democrats and Republicans, the extent to which these differences are reflected in word usage has been theorized but is largely untested. The connection between values and language is, theoretically, not limited just to politicians, but should be especially evident among politicians as representatives of existing ideological poles. In this article, we examine elite rhetoric through the lens of four value-centered theoretical frameworks (Lakoff's Parenting Styles model, Moral Foundations Theory, Schwartz's Values Theory, and Motivated Social Cognition Theory). Contrary to the expectations posited by these four theories, we find little reliable evidence of value-related language differences between Democratic and Republican politicians. Our findings suggest that, at least when it comes to elite rhetoric, widely accepted theoretical claims about the value-based nature of political language and political differences are not consistently supported by empirical analysis.","[Neiman, Jayme L.] Univ No Iowa, Dept Polit Sci, 358 Sabin Hall, Cedar Falls, IA 50614 USA; [Gonzalez, Frank J.; Wilkinson, Kevin; Smith, Kevin B.; Hibbing, John R.] Univ Nebraska, Dept Polit Sci, Lincoln, NE USA",,"Neiman, JL (corresponding author), Univ No Iowa, Dept Polit Sci, 358 Sabin Hall, Cedar Falls, IA 50614 USA.",jayme.neiman@uni.edu,"Gonzalez, Frank J./Y-5135-2019","Gonzalez, Frank J./0000-0002-1953-5764",,,,,42,19,19,0,17,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1058-4609,1091-7675,,POLIT COMMUN,Polit.

The present study addresses the use of imperatives in a corpus of upper-level A-graded student papers from 16 disciplines. A total of 822 papers collected within the past 5 years were analyzed for imperative use, with particular emphasis placed on the main text of papers from the five disciplines with the highest proportion of imperatives. In each of these disciplines, text-based interviews were conducted with faculty members to establish disciplinary contexts. Results show that imperatives are used frequently in physics, philosophy, economics, mechanical engineering, and linguistics, though in quite varying ways. The interview data suggest that successful and experienced student writers adopt the potentially 'high risk strategy' (Hyland 2012) of initiating a sentence with an imperative for various strategic purposes that are discipline-specific.

This study shows that French and German speakers employ the same phonetic contrast to indicate the nature of that turn continuation. In spite of the typological difference between the German use of glottalization and the French use of linking phenomena for word boundaries involving word-initial vowels, speakers of both languages exploit this contrast systematically in their design of multiunit turns. Initial confirmations are joined directly to subsequent vowel-fronted turn components when speakers respond with an internally cohesive multiunit confirming turn. The components are separated by glottalization when responses involve multiple actions or departures from a trajectory projected by the turn-initial confirmation. This is further evidence that sound patterns shape interaction and are not solely determined by language-specific phonologies.

The results demonstrate that spoken and written modalities are influenced differently by anxiety with the impact of output anxiety being significantly stronger in speech than in writing. Another important finding was that input and processing anxiety had both facilitating and debilitating effects on learners' L2 output. As regards the effect of task complexity on participants' narratives, the findings suggest that the different stages of language production need to be taken into account when categorizing tasks on the basis of the cognitive load they impose on learners.","[Trebits, Anna] Leuphana Univ Luneburg, ZeMoS, Luneburg, Germany; [Trebits, Anna] Eotvos Lorand Univ, Dept Language Pedag, Sch English & Amer Studies, H-1364 Budapest, Hungary",,"Trebits, A (corresponding author), Leuphana Univ Luneburg, ZeMoS, Luneburg, Germany.;Trebits, A (corresponding author), Eotvos Lorand Univ, Dept Language Pedag, Sch English & Amer Studies, H-1364 Budapest, Hungary.",trebits@leuphana.de,,,,,,,45,5,5,5,52,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0142-6001,1477-450X,,APPL LINGUIST,Appl.

The research reported here contributes to the growing body of work within linguistics that has found experimental methods to be useful in answering questions about representation and constraints on linguistic expression (Hemforth 2013). The wider project examines online identity assumption in online paedophile activity and the policing of such activity, and involves dealing with the linguistic analysis of highly sensitive sexual grooming transcripts. Within the linguistics portion of the project, we examine theories of idiolect and identity through analysis of the 'talk' of perpetrators of online sexual abuse, and of the undercover officers that must assume alternative identities in order to investigate such crimes. The essential linguistic question in this article is methodological and concerns the applicability of experimental work to exploration of online identity and identity disguise. Although we touch on empirical questions, such as the sufficiency of linguistic description that will enable convincing identity disguise, we do not explore the experimental results in detail. In spite of the preference within a range of discourse analytical paradigms for 'naturally occurring' data, we argue that not only does the term prove conceptually problematic, but in certain contexts, and particularly in the applied forensic context described, a rejection of experimentally elicited data would limit the possible types and extent of analyses. Thus, it would restrict the contribution that academic linguistics can make in addressing a serious social problem.","[Grant, Tim; Macleod, Nicci] Aston Univ, Ctr Forens Linguist, Birmingham B4 7ET, W Midlands, England",,"Macleod, N (corresponding author), Aston Univ, Ctr Forens Linguist, Birmingham B4 7ET, W Midlands, England.",n.macleod1@aston.ac.uk,"MacLeod, Nicci/AAC-3051-2020","MacLeod, Nicci/0000-0002-6642-5509",Economic and Social Research Council [ES/L003279/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/L003279/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,58,15,15,3,44,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0142-6001,1477-450X,,APPL LINGUIST,Appl.

French Muslim Women, Foucault, and The Full Veil Ban",AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,,DISCOURSE; FRANCE; ISLAM,"This article proposes a conception of freedom understood as practices. Based on Michel Foucault's work on the ethics of the self, I develop a conception of freedom that exceeds liberation and distinguishes between genuine practices of freedom and practices of the self that are unreflective responses to systems of government. I develop and illustrate this conception through an engagement with the recent French ban on full veils in public spaces and the ethnographic literature on European Muslim revival movements. I reconstruct how Muslim women relate to alternative discourses through specific practices of the self. These practices reveal that French Muslim women actively contest discourses of secularism and liberation that construct them as inherently passive and in need of tutelage. The conception I develop sheds light on some shortcomings of Philip Pettit's notion of freedom as nondomination. I argue that the proposed account is useful to, first, criticize the centrality of the opposition between arbitrary and nonarbitrary power in the definition of freedom. Second, I show that the predominant engagement with the external dimension of freedom in Pettit makes it difficult to capture the particular subjective practices that make up freedom and its development in the presence of power and/or attempts at domination.","[Valdez, Ines] Ohio State Univ, 154 N Oval Mall,2140 Derby Hall, Columbus, OH 43210 USA",,"Valdez, I (corresponding author), Ohio State Univ, 154 N Oval Mall,2140 Derby Hall, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.",inevaldez@gmail.com,"Valdez, Inés/AAH-8008-2021","Valdez, Inés/0000-0002-8834-809X",,,,,81,10,10,0,16,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0003-0554,1537-5943,,AM POLIT SCI REV,Am.

My findings suggest that reading Western reports on China shifts immigrants' perceptions of government performance in different directions, depending on how similar reports are censored in Chinese media. On issues that are strictly censored, immigrants exposed to Western reports became more critical of their home government's performance and decreased their trust in official discourse. Conversely, on issues that are relatively open to independent reporting, immigrants did not become more critical of government performance, and their trust in official discourse maintained after being exposed to Western information.","[Tai, Qiuqing] Yale Univ, Dept Polit Sci, POB 208301, New Haven, CT 06520 USA",,"Tai, QQ (corresponding author), Yale Univ, Dept Polit Sci, POB 208301, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",qiuqing.tai@yale.edu,,,,,,,42,2,2,14,47,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1058-4609,1091-7675,,POLIT COMMUN,Polit.

Federal Elections Commission (FEC) decision opens the door to an important question: Did the degree to which media corporations benefited from the changes in campaign finance law influence their news outlets' coverage of the Citizens United decision? In other words, is it possible to identify variation in how media outlets covered the Supreme Court decision that correlates with the degree to which those outlets' parent companies profited from the resulting increase in campaign spending? Answering this question will provide an important and much-too-uncommon opportunity to systematically test for bias in news coverage. Replicating the method used by Gilens and Hertzman (2000) in their own test of coverage of the 1996 Telecommunications Act, this analysis reveals that newspapers belonging to media corporations that own more television stations covered the Citizens United ruling systematically differentlyand more favorablythan those with few or no television stations. This has important implications for the degree to which the news produced by increasingly conglomerated and corporatized media companies may eschew neutral or balanced coverage in favor of news frames that promote their own financial interests.","[Bailard, Catie Snow] George Washington Univ, Sch Media & Publ Affairs, 805 21st St NW,Suite 400, Washington, DC 20052 USA",,"Bailard, CS (corresponding author), George Washington Univ, Sch Media & Publ Affairs, 805 21st St NW,Suite 400, Washington, DC 20052 USA.",cbailard@gwu.edu,,,,,,,37,6,6,0,21,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1058-4609,1091-7675,,POLIT COMMUN,Polit.

Integrating insights from work on banal and everyday nationalism, collective rituals, national identity, and commemorative struggles with survey-based findings from political psychology, I demonstrate that meanings attached to the nation vary within and across populations as well as over time, with important implications for microinteraction and for political beliefs and behavior, including support for exclusionary policies and authoritarian politics.

Using data on new-investor recruitment into Kenya's nascent capital market, the Nairobi Securities Exchange, from 2005 through 2008, I identified mechanisms driving social segmentation as well as integration of disparate groups. The empirical context is characterized by weak formal institutions and high levels of inter-ethnic distrust, a novel but productive setting for studying how potential adopters use social identities to resolve uncertainty around expected gains of participating in a new market. Results show that instead of exhibiting blanket influence by homophilous peers, potential investors were positively influenced by profits earned by proximate coethnic peers primarily when their own exposure to corrupt financial organizations was higher but were negatively influenced by the profits of ethnic outsiders when the market was identified with distrusted political rivals. Several mechanisms moderated this pattern of distrust, including inter-ethnic residential and religious integration but especially the use of national language rather than ethnic language advertising campaigns, which reframed the market as a shared social identity. Findings indicate that the negative effects of social segmentation, including the distorting influences of dissimilar peers and environmental factors such as political tensions and distrust in institutions, can be reversed when potential investors learn about new market opportunities from neutral third parties or when policy makers frame such practices in socially neutral language.","Univ Chicago, Booth Sch Business, Chicago, IL 60637 USA",,"Yenkey, CB (corresponding author), Univ Chicago, Booth Sch Business, 5807 S Woodlawn Ave, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",cyenkey@chicagobooth.edu,,,National Science Foundation [0802469]; Cornell University's Center for the Study of Economy and Society; Einaudi Center for International Studies; Center for the Study of Inequality; Graduate School International Research Fund; Initiative on Global Markets at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business,National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Cornell University's Center for the Study of Economy and Society; Einaudi Center for International Studies; Center for the Study of Inequality; Graduate School International Research Fund; Initiative on Global Markets at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business,"This project would not have been possible without data access provided by Rose Mambo and James Gikonyo at the CDSC or Cornell University's willingness to protect it.

A court decision ruling a statute unconstitutional can generate up to a 28% relative reduction in the probability of adoption, and a ruling of constitutionality can both increase the probability of adoption by a similar amount and more than double the amount of borrowed text.

Fact-checking has come to play an increasingly important role in political coverage in the United States, but some research suggests it may be ineffective at reducing public misperceptions about controversial issues. However, fact-checking might instead help improve political discourse by increasing the reputational costs or risks of spreading misinformation for political elites. To evaluate this deterrent hypothesis, we conducted a field experiment on a diverse group of state legislators from nine U.S. states in the months before the November 2012 election. In the experiment, a randomly assigned subset of state legislators was sent a series of letters about the risks to their reputation and electoral security if they were caught making questionable statements. The legislators who were sent these letters were substantially less likely to receive a negative fact-checking rating or to have their accuracy questioned publicly, suggesting that fact-checking can reduce inaccuracy when it poses a salient threat.","[Nyhan, Brendan] Dartmouth Coll, Dept Govt, Hanover, NH 03755 USA; [Reifler, Jason] Univ Exeter, Dept Polit, Polit, Exeter EX4 4RJ, Devon, England",,"Nyhan, B (corresponding author), Dartmouth Coll, Dept Govt, 305 Silsby Hall,HB 6108, Hanover, NH 03755 USA.",nyhan@dartmouth.edu; j.reifler@exeter.ac.uk,,"Reifler, Jason/0000-0002-1116-7346",Democracy Fund; New America Foundation,Democracy Fund; New America Foundation,"Funding support was provided by the Democracy Fund and New America Foundation.

We offer a framework that accounts for this discrepancy. Using two priming experiments conducted among American Catholics, Turkish Muslims, and Israeli Jews, we disentangle the role of religious social identity and religious belief, and differentiate among types of immigrants based on their ethnic and religious similarity to, or difference from, members of the host society. We find that religious social identity increases opposition to immigrants who are dissimilar to in-group members in religion or ethnicity, while religious belief engenders welcoming attitudes toward immigrants of the same religion and ethnicity, particularly among the less conservative devout. These results suggest that different elements of the religious experience exert distinct and even contrasting effects on immigration attitudes, manifested in both the citizenry's considerations of beliefs and identity and its sensitivity to cues regarding the religion of the target group.","[Bloom, Pazit Ben-Nun] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Polit Sci, Jerusalem, Israel; [Arikan, Gizem] Yasar Univ, Dept Int Relat, Izmir, Turkey; [Courtemanche, Marie] Thiel Coll, Dept Polit Sci, Greenville, PA USA",,"Bloom, PB (corresponding author), Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Polit Sci, Jerusalem, Israel.",pazit.bennun@mail.huji.ac.il; gizem.arikan@yasar.edu.tr; mcourtemanche@thiel.edu,"Arikan, Gizem/AAK-9573-2020","Arikan, Gizem/0000-0002-2083-7321; Ben-Nun Bloom, Pazit/0000-0003-4930-3355",Israel Science Foundation (ISF) [676/13],Israel Science Foundation (ISF)(Israel Science Foundation),"For invaluable advice and support at different stages of the project, we are grateful to Gadi Bloom, Amnon Cavari, Jack Citrin, Emre Erdogan, Ted Jelen, David Sears, Eser Sekercioglu, the journal's editors, and four anonymous reviewers, as well as participants at the 2013 annual meetings of the Midwest Political Science Association, the International Society of Political Psychology, the Israel Political Science Association, and the 2014 Religion, Democracy and Law International Conference in London Metropolitan University.

Based on a linguistic ethnography, this article presents some of these neglected perspectives on English for development at a private and unreformed Qawmi madrasa in rural Bangladesh. The findings show that people in the madrasa from a reflexively traditional stance, reject economic progress and western development programmes, and largely resist English as a language of development.

For children with severe speech impairment (SSI) who have little or no intelligible speech, active participation in conversations is challenging and can be critical for their social inclusion and participation. The present study investigated the conversational patterns emerging from interactions between children with SSI who use aided communication and typically speaking conversation partners (CPs) and explored whether active participation was different in interactions with different numbers of partners (dyadic versus multi-person interactions). An unusually large multilingual dataset was used (N= 85 conversations). This allowed us to systematically investigate discourse analysis measures indicating participation: the distribution of conversational control (initiations versus responses versus recodes) and summoning power (obliges versus comments). The findings suggest that (i) conversations were characterized by asymmetrical conversational patterns with CPs assuming most of the conversational control and (ii) multi-person interactions were noticeably more symmetric compared to dyadic, as children's active participation in multi-person interactions was significantly increased.

These affect the established fields of journalism and of Media and Information Literacy (MIL). They create opportunities for new entrants from the margins to enter professional fields in need of revamping. Using information and communication sciences research on policy and organizations and on the interplay between agency, platforms and networks, this analysis focuses on three main criteria for evaluating the field-configuring role of disinformation: policy rules and professional canons (to regain some lost political and economic ground), key events and projects (to provide sense-making strategies), and interactions with audiences and communities (to restore trust and reputation). Focusing on the European Union as main terrain of analysis due to its pioneering initiatives, this analysis first considers the mutual benefits afforded by the fight against disinformation. Then considers three main challenges: MIL risks being reduced to news literacy, digital journalism risks being reduced to fact-checking, and the disinformation discourse risks downscaling the emphasis on information. It concludes with the implications for the future for all actors to effect real field change in MIL and journalism.","[Frau-Meigs, Divina] Sorbonne Nouvelle Univ, UFR Langues Litteratures Cultures & Soc Etrangere, Paris, France",,"Frau-Meigs, D (corresponding author), Sorbonne Nouvelle Univ, UFR Langues Litteratures Cultures & Soc Etrangere, Paris, France.",divina.frau-meigs@sorbonne-nouvelle.fr,,,,,,,46,0,0,0,0,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

However, these insights are mainly based on studies of minoritized learners of English as a second language. Drawing on a one-year ethnographic study conducted in six Palestinian schools in Northern Israel, the present study investigated the effects of translanguaging in a conflict-ridden context, where both the teachers and the learners are minoritized and English is learned as a foreign language. Drawing upon concept of implicit censorship and linguistic citizenship, we propose colonized education as a framework for understanding the tensions between translanguaging, as a decolonial pedagogy, and English language learning. Our findings suggest that while translanguaging may indeed have a liberatory force, it could also, at the same time, take an emotional-pedagogic toll that may hinder language learning rather than support it. In contrast, critical discussions of issues that are politically and emotionally laden may be highly effective, even when conducted in the target language.","[Awayed-Bishara, Muzna; Netz, Hadar] Tel Aviv Univ, Sch Educ, Tel Aviv, Israel; [Milani, Tommaso] Univ Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Vastra Gotaland, Sweden",,"Awayed-Bishara, M (corresponding author), Tel Aviv Univ, Sch Educ, Tel Aviv, Israel.",muznabishara@gmail.com; hadar.netz@gmail.com; tommaso.milani@svenska.gu.se,,,Israel Science Foundation [89/489],Israel Science Foundation(Israel Science Foundation),This researh was supported by the Israel Science Foundation (grant No. 89/489).,,47,0,0,5,5,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0142-6001,1477-450X,,APPL LINGUIST,Appl.

We find that they are. This is especially true in Senate committees-where women are about 10% more likely to be interrupted. Furthermore, in hearings that discuss women's issues, women are more than twice as likely to be interrupted than while discussing other issues. We see a similar pattern for rapid-fire interruption clusters, an aggressive form of interruption. We further consider a range of moderating factors, which yields little evidence that women change their communication strategy as they gain experience in Congress. We also find suggestive evidence that interruptions are driven by mixed-gender interactions.","[Miller, Michael G.] Columbia Univ, Barnard Coll, Dept Polit Sci, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Sutherland, Joseph L.] Emory Univ, Dept Quantitat Theory & Methods, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA",,"Miller, MG (corresponding author), Columbia Univ, Barnard Coll, Dept Polit Sci, New York, NY 10027 USA.",mgmiller@barnard.edu; jls2316@columbia.edu,,"Miller, Michael/0000-0001-5615-9828",,,,,68,0,0,1,1,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0003-0554,1537-5943,,AM POLIT SCI REV,Am.

As such, many practitioners include multiple factualor instructional closed-ended manipulation checks to identify low-attention respondents. However, closed-ended manipulation checks are either correct or incorrect, which allows participants to more easily guess and it reduces the potential variation in attention between respondents. In response to these shortcomings, I develop an automatic and standardized methodology to measure attention that relies on the text that respondents provide in an open-ended manipulation check. There are multiple benefits to this approach. First, it provides a continuous measure of attention, which allows for greater variation between respondents. Second, it reduces the reliance on subjective, paid humans to analyze open-ended responses. Last, I outline how to diagnose the impact of inattentive workers on the overall results, including how to assess the average treatment effect of those respondents that likely received the treatment. I provide easy-to-use software in R to implement these suggestions for open-ended manipulation checks.","[Ziegler, Jeffrey] Emory Univ, Inst Quantitat Theory & Methods, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; [Ziegler, Jeffrey] Trinity Coll Dublin, Dept Polit Sci, Dublin, Ireland",,"Ziegler, J (corresponding author), Emory Univ, Inst Quantitat Theory & Methods, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA.;Ziegler, J (corresponding author), Trinity Coll Dublin, Dept Polit Sci, Dublin, Ireland.",zieglerj@tcd.ie,,"Ziegler, Jeffrey/0000-0003-3905-7488",,,,,19,1,1,1,1,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1047-1987,1476-4989,,POLIT ANAL,Polit.

Seventy-five Catalan learners of French participated in three training sessions with short dialogues, in one of three conditions: speech-only, non-embodied logatome, and embodied logatome. Before and after the training period, participants carried out an identical pre- and posttest which consisted of reading four dialogues aloud.

Fifty learners completed a background questionnaire, an elicited imitation task, and the contextualized preference task. Learners' preference for a deleted variant tended to increase as proficiency level increased, as did sensitivity to variables previously shown to constrain native speaker patterns of variation, including speaker gender, surrounding phonetic context, and grammatical category of the lexical item containing /d/.

We argue that because of its continuity with the canonical use, the hesitator koo (a) projects a descriptive term as a possible search outcome, and (b) indicates difficulty in describing in words what the speaker wants to say. In addition to initiating or continuing a search, the hesitator koo provides information about the type and nature of the resolution of search, thereby enhancing the intersubjectivity of the search process.

Through in-depth interviews with ten journalists working for Korean news organizations, supplemented with an analysis of self-reflective articles, this study investigates how journalists experience this audience hostility and harassment, how they cope with it, and how their practices are influenced by it. The analysis reveals that, combined with the dualistic views of populist politics and the influence of misogynic narratives, journalists who cover topics, such as politics and gender, are more likely to become targets of anti-press violence. Moreover, it shows that anti-press violence induces negative emotions, such as discomfort, anger, lethargy, and fear, among journalists. To cope with these emotions, with little support from their news organizations, journalists tend to pursue emotion-focused coping strategies, such as striving for perfection in the newswork process, building emotional boundaries between the audience and themselves, counter-hating readers, and blaming other journalists. Finally, the paper suggests that anti-press violence in Korea promotes a chilling effect in news organizations that, consequently, may infringe on individual journalists' autonomy and editorial independence.","[Kim, Changwook] Handong Global Univ, Global Leadership Sch, Pohang, South Korea; [Shin, Wooyeol] Kyungnam Univ, Dept Media & Visual Arts, Chang Won, South Korea",,"Shin, W (corresponding author), Kyungnam Univ, Dept Media & Visual Arts, Chang Won, South Korea.",wooyeolshin@gmail.com,"Shin, Wooyeol/ABA-2429-2021","Shin, Wooyeol/0000-0003-3813-4103; Kim, Changwook/0000-0002-7657-2094",,,,,30,0,0,2,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

Hargan (an appellate case regarding unaccompanied immigrant minors' abortion rights) alongside systemic injustices in immigration detention (e.g., exposure to miscarriage risks, coerced sterilization, shackling). These injustices, I argue, emerge from conflicts and compromises over fetal citizenship within the American radical right. Although pro-life and anti-immigrant discourses assume opposing logics of citizenship, respectively interpreting immigrants' fetuses as fetal citizens or anchor babies, these contradictions are neutralized by two techniques. Debilitation (systematic degradation of a disposable population) enables the appearance of fetal protection to coexist with de facto exposure to death, injury, and risk. Paralegality (quasi-legal policy making by enforcement agents) allows situational shifts in the meaning of fetal citizenship and adjustments to the pro-life/anti-immigrant compromise. Both obscure culpability for reproductive injustice, reinforce interlocking oppressions, and control women's bodies in order to control the body politic's demographic future.","[Leach, Brittany R.] Univ Virginia, Dept Women Gender & Sexual Studies, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA",,"Leach, BR (corresponding author), Univ Virginia, Dept Women Gender & Sexual Studies, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA.",brl4xd@virgina.edu,,,Citizen and Scholars Foundation's Charlotte Newcombe Doctoral Dissertation Fellowship,Citizen and Scholars Foundation's Charlotte Newcombe Doctoral Dissertation Fellowship,"I amgrateful for the support of the Citizen and Scholars Foundation's Charlotte Newcombe Doctoral Dissertation Fellowship and for the guidance of my dissertation committee: Lawrie Balfour, Denise Walsh, Stephen K.

Drawing on a preregistered research design, we test the influence of dual socioeconomic revolutions that spread throughout Africa during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries-export agriculture and print technologies. We argue these changes transformed ethnicity via their effects on politicization and boundary-making. Print technologies strengthened imagined communities, leading to more salient-yet porous-ethnic identities. Cash crop endowments increased groups' mobilizational potential but with more exclusionary boundaries to control agricultural rents. Using historical data on cash crops and African language publications, we find that groups exposed to these historical forces are more likely to be politically relevant in the postindependence period, and their members report more salient ethnic identities. We observe heterogenous effects on boundary-making as measured by interethnic marriage; relative to cash crops, printing fostered greater openness to assimilate linguistically related outsiders. Our findings illuminate not only the historical sources of ethnic politicization but also mechanisms shaping boundary formation.","[Pengl, Yannick, I] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Humanities Social & Polit Sci, Int Conflict Res, Zurich, Switzerland; [Roessler, Philip] William & Mary, Dept Govt, Williamsburg, VA USA; [Rueda, Valeria] Univ Nottingham, Dept Econ, Nottingham, England",,"Pengl, YI (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Humanities Social & Polit Sci, Int Conflict Res, Zurich, Switzerland.",yannick.pengl@icr.gess.ethz.ch; proessler@wm.edu; valeria.rueda@nottingham.ac.uk,,"Pengl, Yannick/0000-0002-0373-0952; Rueda, Valeria/0000-0002-4967-3172",Swiss National Science Foundation [P0EZP1_159076]; US National Science Foundation [1628498],Swiss National Science Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)European Commission); US National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"This research was generously supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation (grant #P0EZP1_159076, Pengl) and the US National Science Foundation (award #1628498, Roessler).",,118,0,0,6,6,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0003-0554,1537-5943,,AM POLIT SCI REV,Am.

Centering colonialism and racism in our analysis, this commentary considers how applied linguistics often focuses on modest reforms supporting affirmation and inclusion of marginalized populations and practices, rather than on fundamental institutional changes required to eradicate the forces that produce marginalization. As applied linguists grapple with questions surrounding the extent to which their work contributes in substantive ways to social justice struggles, we are inspired by collaborations that challenge us to reconsider normative assumptions about both language and justice. These collaborations demand a comprehensive reckoning that frames social justice not as a normative reality that can be achieved through modest reforms to liberal governance, but rather as an existential horizon that necessitates a fundamental reimagination of communication's role in narrating and creating decolonial worlds that sustain collective well-being.","[Rosa, Jonathan] Stanford Univ, Grad Sch Educ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Flores, Nelson] Univ Penn, Grad Sch Educ, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",,"Rosa, J (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Grad Sch Educ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",jdrosa@stanford.edu,,,,,,,0,1,1,11,11,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0142-6001,1477-450X,,APPL LINGUIST,Appl.

While research use (or lack thereof) in the classroom has been debated by researchers for decades, researchers have rarely investigated themselves as stakeholders in the relationship. However, it is vital to know researchers' approaches to the issue so that collaborative researcher-practitioner relationships may be fostered. Hence, the current survey study explored: (a) L2 researchers' identities; (b) their perceptions of the research-practice relationship; and (c) predictors of their perceptions. Participants were 217 researchers from 25 countries with 31 different first-language backgrounds. The results showed that L2 researchers' identities often crossed multiple boundaries, as L2 learners, teachers, as well as researchers. A factor analysis showed that researchers held distinct beliefs for their own research (individual self) and for researchers in general (collective self). The regression models revealed that L2 teaching experience, pre-service teacher training experience, and institutional rewards positively predicted researchers' perceptions of L2 practice. We argue that it is largely researchers' responsibility to facilitate the research-practice dialogue.","[Sato, Masatoshi] Univ Andres Bello, Dept English, Fernandez Concha 700, Santiago 7550000, Chile; [Loewen, Shawn; Pastushenkov, Dmitrii] Michigan State Univ, Language Studies 2, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",,"Sato, M (corresponding author), Univ Andres Bello, Dept English, Fernandez Concha 700, Santiago 7550000, Chile.",masatoshi.sato@unab.cl,,"Sato, Masatoshi/0000-0001-7111-3406",Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT: the Ministry of Education of Chile) under the Fondo National de Desarrollo Cientifico y Tecnologico [FONDECYT: 1181533]; Chilean National Commission of Science and Technology (CONICYT) [CIE160009],Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT: the Ministry of Education of Chile) under the Fondo National de Desarrollo Cientifico y Tecnologico; Chilean National Commission of Science and Technology (CONICYT),This work was supported by the Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT: the Ministry of Education of Chile) under the Fondo National de Desarrollo Cientifico y Tecnologico (FONDECYT: 1181533) as well as PIA (CIE160009) from the Chilean National Commission of Science and Technology (CONICYT) awarded to M.S.,,55,0,0,5,5,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0142-6001,1477-450X,,APPL LINGUIST,Appl.

We assessed cognitive performance in working memory, alertness, divided attention, and verbal fluency on a weekly basis.

Our results provide no evidence of cognitive improvement differing between the Spanish and either of the control groups during any phase of the training period.

To measure specialization types within a consistent methodological frame, we utilize structural topic modeling. These measures capture specialization strategies used at an early career stage. We connect them to a crucial long-term outcome in academia: becoming an advisor. Event-history models reveal that specific topic choices and novel combinations exhibit a positive influence, whereas focused theses make no substantial difference. In particular, theses related to the cultural turn, methods, or race are tied to academic careers that lead to mentorship. Thematic consistency of students' publication track also has a strong positive effect on the chances of becoming an advisor.

The present study investigated the conversational patterns emerging from interactions between children with SSI who use aided communication and typically speaking conversation partners (CPs) and explored whether active participation was different in interactions with different numbers of partners (dyadic versus multi-person interactions). An unusually large multilingual dataset was used (N= 85 conversations). This allowed us to systematically investigate discourse analysis measures indicating participation: the distribution of conversational control (initiations versus responses versus recodes) and summoning power (obliges versus comments). The findings suggest that (i) conversations were characterized by asymmetrical conversational patterns with CPs assuming most of the conversational control and (ii) multi-person interactions were noticeably more symmetric compared to dyadic, as children's active participation in multi-person interactions was significantly increased. Clinical implications and best practice recommendations are discussed.","[Drosopoulou, Christina Sotiropoulou; Murray, Janice] Manchester Metropolitan Univ, Hlth Profess Dept, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Smith, Martine; Lynch, Yvonne] Univ Dublin, Trinity Coll, Clin Speech & Language Studies, Dublin, Ireland; [Launonen, Kaisa; Neuvonen, Kirsi] Univ Helsinki, Fac Med, Helsinki, Finland; [Stadskleiv, Kristine] Oslo Univ Hosp, Dept Child Neurol, Oslo, Norway; [Von Tetzchner, Stephen] Univ Oslo, Dept Psychol, Oslo, Norway",,"Drosopoulou, CS (corresponding author), Manchester Metropolitan Univ, Hlth Profess Dept, Manchester, Lancs, England.",C.SotiropoulouDrosopoulou@leeds.ac.uk,,"Neuvonen, Kirsi A./0000-0002-6265-0290; Launonen, Kaisa/0000-0002-2877-496X","National Council for Scientific and Technological Development; Foundation for Research Support of Rio de Janeiro; SDo Paulo Research Foundation; Ontario Federation of Cerebral Palsy; Ontario Neurotrauma Foundation; Stichting Milo, Schijndel; Stiftelsen Sophies Minde; University of Oslo; Royal Kentalis","National Council for Scientific and Technological Development(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); Foundation for Research Support of Rio de Janeiro; SDo Paulo Research Foundation; Ontario Federation of Cerebral Palsy; Ontario Neurotrauma Foundation; Stichting Milo, Schijndel; Stiftelsen Sophies Minde; University of Oslo; Royal Kentalis","This research was supported in part in Brazil by funding from the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development, the Foundation for Research Support of Rio de Janeiro, and the SDo Paulo Research Foundation; in Canada by funding from the Ontario Federation of Cerebral Palsy and the Ontario Neurotrauma Foundation; in the Netherlands by funding from Stichting Milo, Schijndel, and Royal Kentalis; in Norway by funding from Stiftelsen Sophies Minde and University of Oslo.",,56,0,0,1,1,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0142-6001,1477-450X,,APPL LINGUIST,Appl.

J,"Bejan, TM",,,,"Bejan, Teresa M.",,,What Was the Point of Equality?,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE,,,English,Article; Early Access,,,,,,,,"Political theorists often turn to seventeenth-century England and the Levellers as sources of egalitarian insight. Yet by the time the Levellers were active, the claim that human beings were equal by nature was commonplace. Why, in Leveller hands, did a long-standing piety consistent with social hierarchy became suddenly effectual? Inspired by Elizabeth Anderson, this article explores what equality-and the related concept of parity-meant for the Levellers, and what the point, as they saw it, was. I argue that the Levellers' key achievement was subsuming a highly controversial premise of natural parity within the existing language of natural equality. This suggests that modern basic equality is the product of two, potentially contradictory, principles. This, in turn, has important normative, as well as historical and conceptual, implications for how theorists understand the point of equality for egalitarian movements today.","[Bejan, Teresa M.] Univ Oxford, Dept Polit & Int Relat, Oriel Coll, Polit Theory & Oriel Coll, Manor Rd, Oxford OX1 3UQ, England",,"Bejan, TM (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Dept Polit & Int Relat, Oriel Coll, Polit Theory & Oriel Coll, Manor Rd, Oxford OX1 3UQ, England.",teresa.bejan@politics.ox.ac.uk,,,,,,,61,1,1,2,2,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0092-5853,1540-5907,,AM J POLIT SCI,Am.

Based on a linguistic ethnography, this article presents some of these neglected perspectives on English for development at a private and unreformed Qawmi madrasa in rural Bangladesh. The findings show that people in the madrasa from a reflexively traditional stance, reject economic progress and western development programmes, and largely resist English as a language of development. These positions are considerably shaped by their commitments to religion and Arabic, supporting their alternative language and development visions. This article, based on the findings and drawing on Southern theory, interrogates the promotion of English for development, and asks how alert it is to heterogenous and complex southern realities.","[Chowdhury, Qumrul Hasan] Univ Dhaka, Dept English, Dhaka, Bangladesh; [Chowdhury, Qumrul Hasan] Kings Coll London, Ctr Language Discourse & Commun, London, England",,"Chowdhury, QH (corresponding author), Univ Dhaka, Dept English, Dhaka, Bangladesh.;Chowdhury, QH (corresponding author), Kings Coll London, Ctr Language Discourse & Commun, London, England.",qumrul.chowdhury@du.ac.bd,,,Commonwealth Scholarship Commission in the UK [BDCS-2014-41],Commonwealth Scholarship Commission in the UK,"I am grateful to Commonwealth Scholarship Commission in the UK for funding (scholarship ref no: BDCS-2014-41) my doctoral research this article is based on.

This article makes two main original contributions to the field of digital journalism. First, it introduces the theoretical concept of discursive propagators that addresses the often neglected information impact of state-run news agencies operating in authoritarian states and their influence on other news media. By examining this seldom studied area of news production in the region, we are able to glean some news content that has the potential of influencing Arabic news media. Second, the study examines a unique Arabic language dataset and analyzes it using topic modelling and other digital approaches that are not often employed in the analysis of Arabic news. The analysis of digital state news agency coverage is contextualized to provide more insight into this digital type of content that often sets the tone of local journalistic production about the Arab Spring and other politically sensitive issues.","[Al-Rawi, Ahmed; Iskandar, Adel] Simon Fraser Univ, Sch Commun, Fac Commun Art & Technol, Burnaby, BC, Canada",,"Al-Rawi, A (corresponding author), Simon Fraser Univ, Sch Commun, Fac Commun Art & Technol, Burnaby, BC, Canada.",aalrawi@sfu.ca,,"Al-Rawi, Ahmed/0000-0001-7336-1550",,,,,72,0,0,1,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

This article, however, reports on nondisaffiliative uses of rhetorical questions based on a particular structure in Mandarin, bushi horizontal ellipsis ma, which can serve as a conventional question, a disaffiliative rhetorical question, or a nondisaffiliative rhetorical question. Although much less studied, nondisaffiliative uses are by far more frequent in conversations. Integrating discourse-functional linguistics and conversation analysis, this study argues that nondisaffiliative bushi horizontal ellipsis ma rhetorical questions work to pursue common ground so as to move the activity-in-progress forward. Moreover, it examines the sequential contexts in which they are recurrently produced and identifies the interactional clues-epistemic, sequential, prosodic-that make these rhetorical questions recognizable as seeking common ground. This article contributes to our understanding of the rhetorical question as a grammatical device that maximizes intersubjectivity in conversation, further confirming the mutual influence between grammar and social interaction.

We provide a framework for causal inference with latent treatments in high-dimensional interventions. Using this framework, we show that the randomization of texts alone is insufficient to identify the causal effects of latent treatments, because other unmeasured treatments in the text could confound the measured treatment's effect. We provide a set of assumptions that is sufficient to identify the effect of latent treatments and a set of strategies to make these assumptions more plausible, including explicitly adjusting for potentially confounding text features and nontraditional experimental designs involving many versions of the text. We apply our framework to a survey experiment and an observational study, demonstrating how our framework makes text-based causal inferences more credible.","[Fong, Christian] Univ Michigan, Dept Polit Sci, 6640 Haven Hall,505 S State St, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Grimmer, Justin] Stanford Univ, Dept Polit Sci, 212 Encina Hall West,616 Jane Stanford Way, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Grimmer, Justin] Stanford Univ, Hoover Inst, 212 Encina Hall West,616 Jane Stanford Way, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",,"Fong, C (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Dept Polit Sci, 6640 Haven Hall,505 S State St, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",cjfong@umich.edu; jgrimmer@stanford.edu,,,,,,,28,0,0,2,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0092-5853,1540-5907,,AM J POLIT SCI,Am.

It distinguishes between a journalistic logic, in which referencing practices follow established journalistic ways of ensuring facticity and context, and a movement logic, in which references are used to obtain political, movement-oriented goals of dismissing opponents, supporting your allies, multiplying forces and building a community. Based on a manual quantitative content analysis of more than 4,500 references extracted from 1,000 randomly selected articles by 20 right-wing alternative news media from six countries (US, UK, Germany, Austria, Sweden, Denmark), the article shows that alternative news media predominantly follow a journalistic logic in their referencing practices, though at the expense of a limited originality of sources. Despite their anti-mainstream ambition, alternative news media frequently refer to mainstream media, but only rarely dismiss or re-frame content published by these media. The article discusses these practices as an expression of the hybrid nature of alternative news media situated at the boundary between journalism and political activism. Moreover, it addresses broader implications for the relationship between alternative and mainstream journalistic practice in the digital realm.","[Mayerhoffer, Eva; Heft, Annett] Roskilde Univ, Dept Commun & Arts, Roskilde, Denmark; [Heft, Annett] Free Univ Berlin, Inst Media & Commun Studies, Berlin, Germany; [Heft, Annett] Weizenbaum Inst Networked Soc, Berlin, Germany",,"Mayerhoffer, E (corresponding author), Roskilde Univ, Dept Commun & Arts, Roskilde, Denmark.",evamay@ruc.dk,,"Mayerhoffer, Eva/0000-0002-4644-9060",German Federal Ministry of Education and Research [16DII114],German Federal Ministry of Education and Research(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),"This work was supported by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research, funding code 16DII114.",,40,3,3,3,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

I argue that Mexican insurgents deployed Indigenous genealogies to instantiate what I call restorative revolution, a form of revolutionary thinking that prioritized memorialization over absolute foundation. Mexico's restorative project began with calls for the return of the Anahuac Empire, an Indigenous genealogy that memorialized histories of popular self-rule to legitimize postcolonial demands. I suggest that the Anahuac movement transformed the principles of radical republican thought by mobilizing around religious, plebeian, and hemispheric identities. Each of these characteristics problematizes dominant interpretations of republicanism as a secular, elite, and national enterprise.

But how does the economic news track the welfare of different income groups in an era of rising inequality? Whose economy does the news cover? Drawing on a large new dataset of US news content, we demonstrate that the tone of the economic news strongly and disproportionately tracks the fortunes of the richest households, with little sensitivity to income changes among the non-rich. Further, we present evidence that this pro-rich bias emerges not from pro-rich journalistic preferences but, rather, from the interaction of the media's focus on economic aggregates with structural features of the relationship between economic growth and distribution. The findings yield a novel explanation of distributionally perverse electoral patterns and demonstrate how distributional biases in the economy condition economic accountability.","[Jacobs, Alan M.] Univ British Columbia, Dept Polit Sci, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Matthews, J.

The present study contributes to this growing body of literature by focusing on playful talk in multiple languages and modalities in EMI mathematics classrooms in a secondary school in Hong Kong. Based on the data collected from a linguistic ethnography, we analyze how the teacher constructs playful talk in order to achieve various pedagogical goals including building rapport, facilitating content explanation and promoting meaningful communication with students. The analysis demonstrates that translanguaging appears to be a critical resource and that several social factors, including the teacher's personal belief, history, sociocultural, and pedagogical knowledge, play a role in constructing playful talk.

Unlike existing methods, the proposed Bipartite Link Community Model (biLCM) (1) applies to two groups of actors, (2) takes into account that actors may be members of more than one community, and (3) allows a pair of actors to interact in more than one way. We apply this method to characterize legislative communities of special interest groups and politicians in the 113th U.S. Congress. Previous empirical studies of interest group politics have been limited by the difficulty of observing the ties between interest groups and politicians directly. We therefore first construct an original dataset that connects the politicians who sponsor congressional bills with the interest groups that lobby on those bills based on more than two million textual descriptions of lobbying activities. We then use the biLCM to make quantitative measurements of actors' community memberships ranging from narrow targeted interactions according to industry interests and jurisdictional committee membership to broad multifaceted connections across multiple policy domains.","[Kim, In Song] MIT, Dept Polit Sci, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Kunisky, Dmitriy] NYU, Courant Inst Math Sci, Dept Math, 251 Mercer St, New York, NY 10012 USA",,"Kim, IS (corresponding author), MIT, Dept Polit Sci, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",insong@mit.edu; kunisky@cims.nyu.edu,,,"National Science Foundation [SES-1264090, SES-1725235]",National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"This work was supported by the National Science Foundation (SES-1264090, SES-1725235 to I.K.).",,48,1,1,4,7,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1047-1987,1476-4989,,POLIT ANAL,Polit.

The collection of papers in this special issue challenges the field of applied linguistics to move beyond an acknowledgement of social inequities (through observation, analysis, and critique) toward cultivating relationships for justice (CRJ) - in order to undo past harms and collectively imagine more just futures. The authors/collaborators demonstrate how building systemic social change involves decentering the individual researcher's interests and instead foregrounding processes of collective solidarity (Martinez et al. 2021), demonstrating how justice is relational and aspirational. In this editorial, we discuss the particular contributions of each paper, alongside thematic connection points across the articles. Our intention in including an editorial, commentaries, and a range of papers is to create space for multi-vocality and diverse genres as part of CRJ.

We focus on the methodic ways in which, over the course of 4 years, a second language speaker and initially novice to such interactions coordinates the transition between interacting with her coparticipants and consulting her own screen, which suspends talk, without creating trouble due to halts in progressivity. Initially drawing on diverse resources, she increasingly resorts to the use of a prospective alert constructed around the verb to check (e.g., I will check), which eventually routinizes in the lexically specific form let me check as a highly context- and activity-bound social action format. We discuss how such change over the participant's video-mediated interactional history contributes to our understanding of social coordination in video-mediated interaction and of participants' recalibrating their grammar-for-interaction while adapting to new situations, languages, or media.

In this article, I argue for a discourse-oriented ethnographic account as an alternative method for documenting and reporting such reflexivity. The overall goal of this article is to examine reflexive research practices in the study of tourism communication. Presenting illustrative cases, I closely analyze how the researcher's co-presence naturally opens up opportunities for some form of intervention in tourist-guide dyads. I show that researcher participation that is intended to resolve local interactional problems can have unintended consequences resulting in marginalization or exclusion of the key participants. The analysis shows that the researcher is not only the knowledge-maker in applied linguistics research but is also an object of analysis in the process.

This article instead treats Hume's Of the Balance of Power, alongside the other essays in his Political Discourses (1752), as conceptual resources for a historically inflected analysis of state balancing. Hume's defense of the balance of power cannot be divorced from his critique of commercial warfare in Of the Balance of Trade and Of the Jealousy of Trade. To better appreciate Hume's historical and economic approach to foreign policy, this article places Hume in conversation with Machiavelli, Guicciardini, Andrew Fletcher, and Montesquieu. International relations scholars suspicious of static paradigms should reconsider Hume's genealogy of the balance of power, which differs from the standard liberal and neorealist accounts. Well before International Political Economy developed as a formal subdiscipline, Hume was conceptually treating economics and power politics in tandem.","[Charette, Danielle] Univ Chicago, Comm Social Thought, Chicago, IL 60637 USA",,"Charette, D (corresponding author), Univ Chicago, Comm Social Thought, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",dcharette@uchicago.edu,,"Charette, Danielle/0000-0002-9233-9380",,,,,105,0,0,5,9,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0003-0554,1537-5943,,AM POLIT SCI REV,Am.

Participants were 56 university learners majoring in French (n=29) and Spanish (n=27), who spent an academic year abroad in the middle of a four-year BA degree programme. Oral data were collected six times over 21months to trace development and change in complexity, accuracy, fluency, and lexis. Results showed ongoing improvements over time on most measures, including accuracy. Correlations indicated long-term relationships between fluency and vocabulary only and that accuracy-complexity relationships emerged in instructed home contexts only. These findings suggest that the affordances of home and abroad contexts can shape learners' linguistic development and use differently.

This study presents a large-scale international survey investigating the role models of English language learners. With data collected from 8,472 participants, analysis investigated whether these learners had English language role models, who the role models were and what characteristics learners valued in them, and investigated systematic variation among subgroups. Results showed that 68 per cent of respondents reported having an English language role model, and four key role model dimensions emerged: overall command of English, paralinguistic features, personal attributes and accent/variety of English. We argue that role modelling may be a highly influential component of the psychological context of second-language acquisition, and conclude by highlighting several valuable areas for future research.","[Muir, Christine; Dornyei, Zoltan; Adolphs, Svenja] Univ Nottingham, Sch English, Nottingham, England",,"Muir, C (corresponding author), Univ Nottingham, Sch English, Nottingham, England.",christine.muir@nottingham.ac.uk,,,Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council Impact Acceleration Account grant (EPSRC IAA) [RR1402],Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council Impact Acceleration Account grant (EPSRC IAA)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),This study was funded by an Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council Impact Acceleration Account grant (EPSRC IAA Reference: RR1402).,,64,10,10,10,30,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0142-6001,1477-450X,,APPL LINGUIST,Appl.

The results of a self-paced reading study combined with a sensicality judgment showed that people with less versus more multilingual experience process metaphors evaluated as being (i) less or (ii) more creative quite similarly in terms of reading times; however, the groups differ significantly in their judgments of semantic sensicality for the more creative metaphors. Although in the case of less creative metaphors groups do not differ, in the case of more creative metaphors, people with more multilingual experience are more likely to say that the metaphor makes sense.

This shift resolved some long-standing problems but insulated the analysis of populism from theoretical and methodological debates in the social sciences. Theoretical restrictions have gone hand in hand with geographical neglect: The near-exclusive focus on the United States, Europe, and Latin America reinforces the blind spots of these existing approaches. An integration of overlooked regions holds the potential for theoretical reconstruction, even though such comparative broadening could as well simply reproduce the persistent impasses. Moreover, post-2016 developments have induced a return to substantive issues, throwing into sharp relief what populism studies have been missing during the past decades. The main challenge today is synthesizing socioeconomic analyses with institutionalist and discourse-theoretical advances without falling into eclecticism.

However, there is a lack of consistent terminology in scholarly literature with regards to such practice and a dearth of studies that compare practice on a wider scale that prevents more holistic understanding of how audience data are being used on the newsroom floor. These issues are addressed with the development of a new participative gatekeeping model with three previously unidentified channels of gatekeeping specifically related to the use of audience data: promotional, for the type of short-term gatekeeping done on news site homepages that involves tracking real-time metrics to position content, often tied to traffic targets; developmental, or longer-term strategies that shape future coverage and are grounded in hypotheses of audience behaviour gleaned from analytics; and a third more porous channel of experimentation where such hypotheses are tested. These channels were observed in ethnographic research in six newsrooms in three different countries at media outlets with diverse sources of revenue: Norway's public broadcaster, NRK; Canada's subscriber-based national news agency, The Canadian Press (CP); and two local newsrooms working within larger media organizations, The Hamilton Spectator in Canada, and The Bournemouth Daily Echo in England. Through a sociological lens, this article distinguishes language to best document the complex processes interconnected with audience data, identifies similarities in practice that override media or revenue systems, and explores how the audience, through the participatory mechanisms of metrics and analytics, shapes newsroom practice.","[Blanchett, Nicole] Bournemouth Univ, Poole, Dorset, England; [Blanchett, Nicole] Sheridan Coll, Inst Technol & Adv Learning, Fac Animat Arts & Design, Oakville, ON, Canada; [Blanchett, Nicole] Ryerson Univ, Sch Journalism, Toronto, ON, Canada",,"Blanchett, N (corresponding author), Bournemouth Univ, Poole, Dorset, England.;Blanchett, N (corresponding author), Sheridan Coll, Inst Technol & Adv Learning, Fac Animat Arts & Design, Oakville, ON, Canada.;Blanchett, N (corresponding author), Ryerson Univ, Sch Journalism, Toronto, ON, Canada.",nicole.blanchett@ryerson.ca,"Blanchett, Nicole/AAO-9616-2020","Blanchett, Nicole/0000-0001-9444-2018",,,,,90,1,1,3,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

To date, the literature has treated this theory as a model that merely explains employer behavior. This article contends that the idea of statistical discrimination, rather than simply providing an explanation, can lead people to view social stereotyping as useful and acceptable and thus help rationalize and justify discriminatory decisions. A preregistered survey experiment with more than 2,000 participants who had managerial experience shows that exposure to statistical discrimination theory strengthened people's belief in the accuracy of stereotypes, their acceptance of stereotyping, and the extent to which they engaged in gender discrimination in a hiring simulation. Reading a critical commentary on the theory mitigated these effects. These findings imply that theories of discrimination, and the language associated with them, can rationalize-or challenge the rationality of-stereotypes and discrimination and, as a result, shape the attitudes and actions of decision-makers in labor markets.","[Tilcsik, Andras] Univ Toronto, Rotman Sch Management, Strategy Org & Soc, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Tilcsik, Andras] Univ Toronto, Rotman Sch Management, Strateg Management, Toronto, ON, Canada",,"Tilcsik, A (corresponding author), Univ Toronto, Rotman Sch Management, 105 St George St, Toronto, ON M5S 3E6, Canada.",andras.tilcsik@rotman.utoronto.ca,,,Institute for Gender and the Economy at the Rotman School of Management,Institute for Gender and the Economy at the Rotman School of Management,"I am grateful to the Institute for Gender and the Economy at the Rotman School of Management for its generous financial and intellectual support.

Yet, although many quantitative scholars are familiar with the conceptual literature, even the most complex quantitative studies eschew engaging with the new wave of more sophisticated concepts of representation that theorists have developed. We discuss what we take to be the main reasons for this gap between theory and empirics, and present four novel conceptions of representation that are both sensitive to theorists' conceptual impulses and operationalizable for quantitative scholars.

The current study sought to extend the literature by comparing three distinct measures of negative cognitions: (a) trained coder (thought-listing), (b) participant coding (thought-listing), and (c) Likert scale. Participants (N= 540) were randomly assigned to view messages in a 2 (language: forceful and non-forceful) x 3 (topic: exercise, fruit and vegetable consumption, and sleep) between subjects factorial design. Exposure to forceful (vs. non-forceful) language resulted in higher negative cognitions across all three measures. Moreover, all three measures of negative cognitions were negatively associated with behavioral intention. Three competing structural models were examined, each using a different measure of negative cognitions. Results demonstrated the three models performed similarly based on comparisons of model fit and variance explained. Despite similar performance among the three measures of negative cognitions, there was a slight, but consistent advantage for the Likert scale measure model in terms of fit, variance explained, and factor loadings. Validation of these three measures of negative cognitions provides communication researchers with the flexibility to choose the measure most appropriate for their needs.","[Reynolds-Tylus, Tobias] James Madison Univ, Sch Commun Studies, Harrisonburg, VA 22807 USA; [Bigsby, Elisabeth; Quick, Brian L.] Univ Illinois, Dept Commun, Urbana, IL USA; [Quick, Brian L.] Univ Illinois, Carle Illinois Coll Med, Urbana, IL USA",,"Reynolds-Tylus, T (corresponding author), James Madison Univ, Sch Commun Studies, Harrisonburg, VA 22807 USA.",reyno2tj@jmu.edu,,"Bigsby, Elisabeth/0000-0002-5808-1005",Campus Research Board at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign [RB18129],Campus Research Board at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,This work was supported by the Campus Research Board at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign under award [RB18129].,,66,9,9,0,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1931-2458,1931-2466,,COMMUN METHODS MEAS,Commun.

Yet such efforts often fall short. Some studies do not demonstrate a gap in the literature, or they overgeneralize about the limitations of contemporary scholarship. Other studies misread contemporary authors or underestimate the complexity of contemporary issues. Interestingly, some studies use ideas that have been superseded: the history of political thought can constrain as well as liberate. Overall, I suggest, some of the boldest claims for the contemporary value of the history of political thought come from scholars whose own contemporary insights sometimes fall short. These problems risk undermining, not underlining, the contemporary relevance of the history of political thought.

The analysis suggests that such responses serve to take issue with the question; specifically, respondents display the answer to be obvious or redundant, challenge the questioner's unknowing stance, or disalign with the further action implications of the question while still providing a polar answer. Comparisons are made with other practices for exerting agency in responses and with resources described for other languages. The resources available in French help participants differentiate in which way the respondent takes issue with the question, notwithstanding significant local particularization by reference to the specific question and its context.

This study also examined how counterarguing, as the cognitive component of psychological reactance, influences available cognitive resources and encoding of message content. The results indicated that ever-vapers in the dogmatic PSA condition reported significantly greater freedom threats and state psychological reactance but not intentions to vape relative to ever-vapers in the suggestive PSA condition. Moreover, counterarguing dogmatic anti-vaping PSAs resulted in fewer available cognitive resources for encoding as evidenced by slower Secondary Task Reaction Times (STRTs) and reduced encoding of message content.

In this article, we draw on interviews with Nigerian media practitioners and a comparison of Boko Haram news coverage in two Nigerian newspapers-one Southern-based/Christian-affiliated and one Northern-based/Muslim-affiliated-to argue that it is crucial to consider a country's political-religious demography in order to understand the way in which religious-based violence is covered in the news. In this respect, we identify micro-, meso- and macro-level theoretical mechanisms through which a country's demography can promote domestic news outlets-regardless of their background and readership-to cover conflict in a more balanced, nuanced, and objective way.","[Demarest, Leila] Leiden Univ, Inst Polit Sci, Leiden, Netherlands; [Godefroidt, Amelie; Langer, Arnim] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Ctr Res Peace & Dev CRPD, Leuven, Belgium",,"Demarest, L (corresponding author), Leiden Univ, Inst Polit Sci, Leiden, Netherlands.",l.demarest@fsw.leidenuniv.nl,"Godefroidt, Amélie/AAY-7234-2020","Godefroidt, Amélie/0000-0002-5010-2860; Demarest, Leila/0000-0001-6887-9937",Research Foundation Flanders-FWO [11B5717N],Research Foundation Flanders-FWO(FWO),"The authors thank the editorial team, in particular Editor Lance Holbert and Associate Editor Keren Tenenboim-Weinblatt, for their valuable support and comments during the review process.

This may lead to hypercorrection, meaning that the prescribed form in one construction is extended to another one in which it is in fact prohibited by prescriptive grammar. We discuss two such cases in Dutch: the hypercorrect use of the comparative particle dan 'than' in equative constructions, and the hypercorrect use of the accusative pronoun hen 'them' for a dative object. In two experiments, high school students of three educational levels were tested on their use of these hypercorrect forms (n(exp1) = 162, n(exp2) = 159). Our results indicate an overall large amount of hypercorrection across all levels of education, including preuniversity level students who otherwise perform better in constructions targeted by prescriptive grammar rules.

Eighteen speakers representing six English varieties were recruited to provide speech stimuli for two English listening tests. Sixty listeners from the same six English varieties took part in the listening tests, and their scores were then assessed against measurable segmental, prosodic, and fluency features found in the speech samples. Results indicate that it is possible to identify particular features of English speech varieties that are most likely to lead to a breakdown in communication, and that the number of such features present in a particular speakers' speech can predict intelligibility.","[Kang, Okim; Moran, Meghan] No Arizona Univ, Dept English, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA; [Thomson, Ron, I] Brock Univ, Appl Linguist, St Catharines, ON, Canada",,"Kang, O (corresponding author), No Arizona Univ, Dept English, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA.",okim.kang@nau.edu,,,Educational Testing Service (ETS) under a Committee of Examiners; TOEFL research grant,Educational Testing Service (ETS) under a Committee of Examiners; TOEFL research grant,"This research was funded by the Educational Testing Service (ETS) under a Committee of Examiners and the TOEFL research grant.

However, in the context of European constitutional courts, media coverage of court decisions can be understood to be a form of justice reporting that focuses on general public interest and is operationalized by case characteristics that indicate the newsworthiness of the decisions. Using the case of the German Federal Constitutional Court, the determining factors behind whether court decisions are featured in the German media (i.e., that they receive media coverage in at least one newspaper article) are expounded. A local text alignment measurement of court decisions and newspaper articles enables media coverage to be identified based on original data on 3,404 decisions and 9,436 newspaper articles from between 2008 and 2018. The results demonstrate that media coverage of the German Court is not affected by declarations of unconstitutionality, though coverage is more likely when a decision is accompanied by a press release, an oral hearing, a dissenting opinion, or a combination of all three items. As these decisional aspects are the prerogative of the FCC, the results demonstrate that the German Constitutional Court has the necessary instruments to independently influence media coverage.","[Meyer, Philipp] Leibniz Univ Hannover, Dept Polit Sci, Res Grp Comparat Govt & German Polit, Hannover, Germany",,"Meyer, P (corresponding author), Leibniz Univ Hannover, Dept Polit Sci, Hannover, Germany.",p.meyer@ipw.uni-hannover.de,"Meyer, Philipp/AAV-7313-2020","Meyer, Philipp/0000-0002-7986-9432",,,,,57,3,3,2,7,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1058-4609,1091-7675,,POLIT COMMUN,Polit.

Drawing upon a corpus of video recordings from dashcams, we show how drivers use the horn for creating awareness; how they target particular vehicles; and how they use it for warnings, for complaints, and in instructing the seeing of an aspect of an ambiguous traffic object. Drivers' use of the horn involves, first, their sounding it in recognizable relations to past, current, and projected configurations of traffic on the road. Second, it involves drivers manipulating the vehicle horn to create sounds of shorter and longer durations that can then produce hearably distinct actions. Third, and finally, the driver can use the horn as an initiating or responsive action in relation to the actions of other members of traffic.

Arguing that this fragmented scholarship falls short of grasping the full scope of the phenomenon, this article offers Decoding Convergence-Divergence (DCD) as an interdisciplinary analytical and conceptual framework. Synthesizing principles from cognitive, cultural, and speaker-centered approaches to meaning multiplicity, this framework was applied in a study that examined news coverage of a CEO's initiative to address income inequality and its reception by different segments of the American audience. The study's results provide a novel demonstration of the joint contribution of opposing theories to the understanding of meaning multiplicity. Specifically, it found that textual polysemy, partisan selective perception, and the use of strategic ambiguity coalesced in the interpretive dynamics of this story. Based on these results, the article discusses the contribution of DCD to bridging competing approaches and the potential applications of the framework.","[Boxman-Shabtai, Lillian] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Commun & Journalism, Jerusalem, Israel",,"Boxman-Shabtai, L (corresponding author), Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Commun & Journalism, Jerusalem, Israel.",lillyboxman@gmail.com,,,Northwestern's School of Communication,Northwestern's School of Communication,"This article is based on a doctoral dissertation that was conducted at Northwestern University.

Many expect that algorithmic filtering and a shift of audiences from legacy media to new intermediaries decrease the diversity of news diets, leading to fragmented societies, polarization and spread of misinformation. Different fields, from journalism research to law and computer science, are involved in the study of media diversity. They operate, however, with vastly different vocabularies, frameworks, and measurements. To overcome this fragmentation, this study provides an extensive overview of conceptualizations and operationalizations of media diversity in different fields using a systematic literature review (1999-2018). This showed a lack of theorizing and linking of conceptual with empirical work in media diversity research. Based on this, we develop a framework on how to move forward: Regarding conceptualization, we call for focusing on different places in the journalistic information chain instead of the classical exposure-supply distinction. Methodologically, automated approaches (e.g., analyzing digital traces) and qualitative approaches (e.g., capturing perceptions of diversity) should receive more attention. For analysis, matters of balance and disparity need to be stressed more, especially discussing possible limits to diversity. Overall, research into media diversity thus needs to be addressed in interdisciplinary collaboration.","[Loecherbach, Felicia; van Atteveldt, Wouter] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Commun, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Moeller, Judith; Trilling, Damian] Univ Amsterdam, Dept Commun, Amsterdam, Netherlands",,"Loecherbach, F (corresponding author), Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Commun, Amsterdam, Netherlands.",f.loecherbach@vu.nl,"Loecherbach, Felicia/AAF-7001-2021; Loe, Fe/AEL-6212-2022; van Atteveldt, Wouter/L-8685-2013","Loecherbach, Felicia/0000-0003-2637-613X; van Atteveldt, Wouter/0000-0003-1237-538X; Moeller, Judith/0000-0001-7491-1155; Trilling, Damian/0000-0002-2586-0352","NWO; eScience center, Joint eScience and Data Science grant [DTEC.2017.014]","NWO(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)); eScience center, Joint eScience and Data Science grant","This work was supported by the NWO and the eScience center, Joint eScience and Data Science grant (DTEC.2017.014).",,233,17,17,7,40,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

This aspect of state capacity and state power is predicated on frequent and dense encounters between the state and the population it seeks to control. We argue that literacy in the language of state administration facilitates state-society interaction by lowering the transaction costs of those encounters. We support this claim with evidence drawing upon detailed historical data from nineteenth-century France during a crucial period of state and nation building. Focusing on the specific domain of French marriage regulations, we find that increasing literacy predicts greater popular involvement with local authorities across French regions over time. These results demonstrate that literacy plays an important role in political development not solely by enhancing loyalty to the state, as the literature has recognized, but also by lowering linguistic and human capital barriers to state-society interaction.","[Zhang, Nan] Max Planck Inst Res Collect Goods, Kurt Schumacher Str 10, D-53113 Bonn, Germany; [Lee, Melissa M.] Princeton Univ, Polit & Int Affairs, 3-S-4 Green Hall, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA",,"Zhang, N (corresponding author), Max Planck Inst Res Collect Goods, Kurt Schumacher Str 10, D-53113 Bonn, Germany.",zhang@coll.mpg.de; melissa.lee@princeton.edu,,,Princeton University's University Committee on Research in the Humanities and Social Sciences,Princeton University's University Committee on Research in the Humanities and Social Sciences,This article is one of several joint articles by the authors.

Malaysia politicizes ethnic difference between Malaysians of Malay, Chinese, and Indian descent. Ethnic Malays enjoy economic concessions unavailable to others, law defines Malaysia as Islamic and speaking Bahasa, and Malay ethno-nationalism constructs Chinese- and Indian-Malaysians as perpetual visitors. Nonetheless, Bahasa has only added to the multilingual repertoires of non-Malays, rather than replaced it. This article analyses survey data about the multilingual practices of Malaysian youth and their folk linguistic talk about what guides their multilingualism. By drawing on critical language policy, it appears that policy may be so ethnonationalist that it has caused disassociation, especially amongst Indian-Malaysians, and sustained multilingualism. The Chinese-Malaysian experience, however, is better explained by a posthumanist perspective whereby language choices appear guided by material and immaterial resources within the Chinese-Malaysian community, rather than by matters of power or politics. In any case, the relative greater multilingualism of Chinese-and Indian-Malaysians was perceived as empowering non-Malay mobility despite ethnonationalist policy.","[Albury, Nathan John] Leiden Univ, Ctr Linguist, Leiden, Netherlands",,"Albury, NJ (corresponding author), Leiden Univ, Ctr Linguist, Leiden, Netherlands.",n.j.albury@hum.leidenuniv.nl,,,European Union [707404],European Union(European Commission),This project has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie grant agreement No 707404.,,57,2,2,5,19,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0142-6001,1477-450X,,APPL LINGUIST,Appl.

This article offers insight into how journalists and political professionals construct practices of data campaigning as all-powerful despite the limited empirical findings to that effect. Specifically, this research delves into how journalistic coverage of campaigns' use of data and analytics has often relied on inflated accounts of the objectivity of analytics, the belief that more data necessarily means more and better knowledge, and narratives of objective outsiders - notably geeks, hackers, nerds, and scientists - that situate analytics staffers as strange and different, and as uniquely qualified to access the truth. To do this, I engage in critical discourse analysis of popular coverage of data campaigning in the US in the years 2008-2016. Ultimately, denaturalizing these narratives helps reveal how they contribute to defining this new campaign strategy as fundamentally concerned with finding objective answers to solvable problems and are key to political professionals' maintenance of organizational power.","[Baldwin-Philippi, Jessica] Fordham Univ, Commun & Media Studies, 441 E Fordham Rd, Bronx, NY 10024 USA",,"Baldwin-Philippi, J (corresponding author), Fordham Univ, Commun & Media Studies, 441 E Fordham Rd, Bronx, NY 10024 USA.",jphilippi@fordham.edu,,,,,,,92,4,4,1,3,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1058-4609,1091-7675,,POLIT COMMUN,Polit.

We examine the effects of Spanish-language media on White and Spanish-speaking Latino attitudes using online survey experiments in English and Spanish, respectively. We expect White Americans to react to Spanish-language media options by developing more hostile attitudes toward Hispanics, and Spanish-speaking Latino audiences to feel a greater sense of belonging in America when they see Spanish represented in the media. We find that seeing articles about non-immigration politics in Spanish, as an option next to English articles, significantly raises racial resentment toward Hispanics among Whites. Among Spanish-speaking Latinos, seeing a political news article option in Spanish increases feelings of inclusion and belonging, even when it is not about a racialized issue like immigration. Such evidence suggests that language alone may prime identity and shape political attitudes for White and Spanish-speaking Latino voters.","[Darr, Joshua P.] Louisiana State Univ, Mass Commun, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA; [Perry, Brittany N.] Texas A&M Univ Syst, Polit Sci, College Stn, TX 77845 USA; [Dunaway, Johanna L.] Texas A&M Univ Syst, Commun, College Stn, TX USA; [Sui, Mingxiao] Ferrum Coll, Commun, Ferrum, VA USA",,"Perry, BN (corresponding author), Texas A&M Univ Syst, Polit Sci, College Stn, TX 77845 USA.",bnperry@tamu.edu,"Darr, Joshua/AAV-9533-2020","Darr, Joshua/0000-0002-0388-5559",Manship School at LSU [3],Manship School at LSU,"Funding for the Qualtrics and MTurk surveys were made possible by the Darlene and Thomas O.

It examines how they report on this translation to researchers in two research projects conducted with two Chinese teachers (Kramsch and Zhang 2018) and one Japanese teacher/researcher (Shibahara and Kramsch forthcoming). Drawing on House (2017) and Pym (2010), it shows how the translation of experience takes place on three levels: the overt level of linguistic equivalence; the covert level of functional equivalence through a cultural filter; and the level of a cultural translation that has to be negotiated according to the subjective needs of the participants. These studies reveal that native language teachers tend to prefer overt over covert translations and that they engage in cultural translation not in order to explore but in order to overcome cultural difference. Such findings confront the field of applied linguistics with its age-old challenge as a field called to translate real-world problems of the practice into the language of research and vice-versa.","[Kramsch, Claire] Univ Calif Berkeley, 1201 Shattuck Ave, Berkeley, CA 94709 USA",,"Kramsch, C (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, 1201 Shattuck Ave, Berkeley, CA 94709 USA.",ckramsch@berkeley.edu,,,,,,,30,4,4,7,32,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0142-6001,1477-450X,,APPL LINGUIST,Appl.

Experimental Evidence from Afghanistan,AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,,INSURGENT VIOLENCE; CASH TRANSFERS; AID; CRIME,"Governments, militaries, and aid organizations all rely on economic interventions to shape civilian attitudes toward combatants during wartime. We have, however, little individual-level evidence that these hearts and minds programs actually influence combatant support. We address this problem by conducting a factorial randomized control trial of two common interventions-vocational training and cash transfers-on combatant support among 2,597 at-risk youth in Kandahar, Afghanistan. We find that training only improved economic livelihoods modestly and had little effect on combatant support. Cash failed to lift incomes, producing a boom-and-bust dynamic in which pro-government sentiment initially spiked and then quickly reversed itself, leaving a residue of increased Taliban support. Conditional on training, cash failed to improve beneficiaries' livelihoods but did increase support for the Afghan government for at least eight months after the intervention. These findings suggest that aid affects attitudes by providing information about government resolve and competence rather than by improving economic livelihoods.","[Lyall, Jason] Dartmouth Coll, Dept Govt, Transnat Studies, Hanover, NH 03755 USA; [Zhou, Yang-Yang] Univ British Columbia, Dept Polit Sci, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Imai, Kosuke] Harvard Univ, Dept Govt, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Imai, Kosuke] Harvard Univ, Dept Stat, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",,"Lyall, J (corresponding author), Dartmouth Coll, Dept Govt, Transnat Studies, Hanover, NH 03755 USA.",jason.lyall@dartmouth.edu; yangyang.zhou@ubc.ca; imai@harvard.edu,"Imai, Kosuke/B-7462-2008","Imai, Kosuke/0000-0002-2748-1022; Zhou, Yang-Yang/0000-0003-0309-4252; Lyall, Jason/0000-0001-9117-7503",Air Force Office of Scientific Research [FA9550-14-1-0072]; United States Institute for Peace [SG-446-15]; National Science Foundation [SES.1148900],Air Force Office of Scientific Research(United States Department of DefenseAir Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR)); United States Institute for Peace; National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"Lyall acknowledges financial support from the Air Force Office of Scientific Research (#FA9550-14-1-0072) and the United States Institute for Peace (#SG-446-15).

J,"Sultan, NS",,,,"Sultan, Nazmul S.",,,Self-Rule and the Problem of Peoplehood in Colonial India,AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,,GANDHI; DEMOCRACY,"This article theorizes the colonial problem of peoplehood that Indian anticolonial thinkers grappled with in their attempts to conceptualize self-rule, or swaraj. British colonial rule drew its legitimacy from a developmentalist conception of the colonized people as backward and disunited. The discourse of underdeveloped colonial peoplehood rendered the Indian people unfit for self-government, suspending their sovereignty to an indefinite future. The concept of swaraj would be born with the rejection of deferred colonial self-government. Yet the persistence of the developmentalist figuration of the people generated a crisis of sovereign authorization. The pre-Gandhian swaraj theorists would be faced with the not-yet claimable figure of the people at the very moment of disavowing the British claim to rule. Recovering this underappreciated pre-Gandhian history of the concept of swaraj and reinterpreting its Gandhian moment, this article offers a new reading of Gandhi's theory of moral self-rule. In so doing, it demonstrates how the history of swaraj helps trace the colonial career of popular sovereignty.","[Sultan, Nazmul S.] Univ Chicago, Dept Polit Sci, Chicago, IL 60637 USA",,"Sultan, NS (corresponding author), Univ Chicago, Dept Polit Sci, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",nazmulsultan@uchicago.edu,,"Sultan, Nazmul/0000-0002-7850-9400",,,,,98,6,6,2,10,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0003-0554,1537-5943,,AM POLIT SCI REV,Am.

On the basis of a video-recorded tasting session in which participants engage in describing aromas, the article details the systematic organization of sniffing in a diversity of sequential environments-in which sniff-prefaced turns offer aroma descriptions in response to olfactory inquiries, confirm previous descriptions, and give alternative descriptions. Analyzing audible sounds made while visibly smelling in face-to-face interaction, the article's aims are twofold: to contribute to the multimodal study of sounds in interaction and also to the study of sensoriality as an intersubjective practice through the systematic investigation of smelling-in-interaction. Data are in French with English translation and multimodal annotations.","[Mondada, Lorenza] Univ Basel, Dept Linguist & Literature French Studies, Maiengasse 51, CH-4056 Basel, Switzerland",,"Mondada, L (corresponding author), Univ Basel, Dept Linguist & Literature French Studies, Maiengasse 51, CH-4056 Basel, Switzerland.",Lorenza.mondada@unibas.ch,,"Mondada, Lorenza/0000-0002-7543-9769",Swiss National Science Foundation [2018-2022],Swiss National Science Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)European Commission),"This study is conducted within the project From Multimodality to Multisensoriality: Language, Body, and Sensoriality in Social Interaction (intSenses), funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation (2018-2022) (PI L.

It is argued that clicks are one way of not saying something, i.e., of not producing talk when talk was due. While many clicks occur alongside verbal material, which provides a method for participants to ascribe an action to the turn in which they are embedded, many do not. The article explores the linguistic (especially phonetic), sequential and embodied resources available to participants to make sense of such clicks. It is argued that some clicks have properties of linguistic organization: They have nonarbitrary form-meaning mappings. Other clicks by contrast are interpreted more as ad hoc, singular events. The article contributes to a less logocentric view of talk-in-interaction.

To compute similarities in web use between countries, we utilized an algorithm that considered both ranking positions and overlap counts on ranked lists of the 100 most popular websites for 174 countries, totaling 6,252 unique websites. Findings from a network analysis and from regressions suggest that countries with similar languages and shared borders, as well as those vastly different in their Internet market sizes, tend to have similar web use patterns. Neither are countries particularly similar to the US in web use nor does the prevalence of English speakers have an influence.","[Ng, Yee Man Margaret] Univ Illinois, Dept Journalism, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Ng, Yee Man Margaret; Taneja, Harsh] Univ Illinois, Inst Commun Res, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Taneja, Harsh] Univ Illinois, Dept Advertising, Urbana, IL 61801 USA",,"Taneja, H (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Inst Commun Res, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.;Taneja, H (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Dept Advertising, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",harsh.taneja@gmail.com,"Ng, Yee Man Margaret/Y-8893-2019","Ng, Yee Man Margaret/0000-0001-5043-9159; Taneja, Harsh/0000-0002-4630-8911",,,,,45,5,5,6,34,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0021-9916,1460-2466,,J COMMUN,J.

The Perspective of Linguistic Laypersons,APPLIED LINGUISTICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,SPEAKING; PROFICIENCY; PERFORMANCE,"Applied linguists have developed complex theories of the ability to communicate in a second language (L2). However, the perspectives on L2 communication ability of speakers who are not trained language professionals have been incorporated neither into theories of communication ability nor in the criteria for assessing performance on general-purpose oral proficiency tests. This potentially weakens the validity of such tests because the ultimate arbiters of L2 speakers' oral performance are not trained language professionals. This study investigates the perspectives of these linguistic laypersons on L2 communication ability. Twenty-three native and non-native English-speaking linguistic laypersons judged L2 speakers' oral performances and verbalized the reasons for their judgments. The results showed that the participants focus not only on the linguistic aspects of the speaker's output but also on features that applied linguists have less paid attention to. Even where speaker's linguistic errors were acknowledged, message conveyance and comprehensibility of the message contributed to their judgment. The study has implications for language testing and the development of tests reflecting the construct of English as a lingua franca.","[Sato, Takanori] Sophia Univ, Tokyo, Japan; [McNamara, Tim] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",,"Sato, T (corresponding author), Sophia Univ, Tokyo, Japan.",taka-sato@sophia.ac.jp,,"Sato, Takanori/0000-0003-1483-966X",TOEFL Small Grants for Doctoral Research in Second or Foreign Language Assessment from Educational Testing Service,TOEFL Small Grants for Doctoral Research in Second or Foreign Language Assessment from Educational Testing Service,This study was supported by the TOEFL Small Grants for Doctoral Research in Second or Foreign Language Assessment from Educational Testing Service.,,39,8,8,1,27,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0142-6001,1477-450X,,APPL LINGUIST,Appl.

We investigate whether it has come to a convergence of topics between the right and the extreme far-right. We analyze the topics nine right-wing outlets, ranging from Fox News to the Neo-Nazi Daily Stormer, covered in 2015/2016 during the US presidential election. We show through topic modeling of 21,919 articles how Breitbart established itself as a media outlet between the extreme far-right and mainstream right by both covering more extreme and more classic conservative topics. We show through time series clustering how Breitbart and Fox News converged in their coverage of Islam and immigration. Finally, we show through hyperlink analysis that the connection between the far-right and the mainstream right is mostly one-sided; while the alternative outlets link to more established ones, the established outlets mostly ignore the outlets from the far-right.","[Kaiser, Jonas; Bourassa, Nikki] Harvard Univ, Berkman Klein Ctr Internet & Soc, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Kaiser, Jonas] Alexander Humboldt Inst Internet & Soc, Berlin, Germany; [Rauchfleisch, Adrian] Natl Taiwan Univ, Grad Inst Journalism, Taipei, Taiwan",,"Kaiser, J (corresponding author), Harvard Univ, Berkman Klein Ctr Internet & Soc, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.;Kaiser, J (corresponding author), Alexander Humboldt Inst Internet & Soc, Berlin, Germany.",j.kaiser@zeppelin-university.net,"Rauchfleisch, Adrian/AAK-4164-2020","RAUCHFLEISCH, ADRIAN/0000-0003-1232-083X",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [KA 4618/1-2],Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft(German Research Foundation (DFG)),This work was supported by Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [KA 4618/1-2].,,46,18,18,3,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

This resulted in four aggregate theoretical dimensions: 1) strategic focus 2) political influence 3) confidence and 4) agency and communion. Our findings chart novel dimensions of gender bias that go beyond the widely theorized tension posed by agency [male] and communion [female].

The bulk of the research has focused on professional white-collar workplaces, but a handful of studies have examined working-class settings such as factories and building sites. This area of research has, however, been concerned with interactions involving co-workers. Studies examining interactions between newcomers and experienced others, such as Holmes and Woodhams (2013), are rare. Using data collected in the working-class setting of the professional kitchen, the current study presents interactions between newcomer trainee cooks and the cooks they worked under. It focuses on the use of directives, which was a prevalent feature of their interactions. As individual utterances, the directives would seem to be designed to elicit specific, ad-hoc actions from trainees. However, closer analysis reveals that series of directives may serve important instructional purposes. Findings from the study are useful in raising the awareness of those assigned to mentor trainees in work settings and should enhance on-the-job workplace training as well as support newcomers as they adjust to their new workplaces.","[Pang, Priscilla] Singapore Univ Social Sci, 463 Clementi Rd, Singapore 599494, Singapore",,"Pang, P (corresponding author), Singapore Univ Social Sci, 463 Clementi Rd, Singapore 599494, Singapore.",priscillapangyn@suss.edu.sg,,"Pang, Priscilla/0000-0003-3650-7682",,,,,52,1,1,2,13,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0142-6001,1477-450X,,APPL LINGUIST,Appl.

Concomitantly, immigration policy changes were leading to widespread arrests and deportation of many Latinos. Herein, we ask two questions: First, to what extent do Latinos perceive and experience discrimination? Second, to what extent do immigration status, generational status, and language use moderate beliefs about discrimination? Using Pew National Survey of Latinos data, we find that Latino beliefs about the problem of discrimination is a decreasing function of proximity to the canonical immigrant-defined here as first-generation immigrants who are Spanish-language dominant. Further, we demonstrate that reported rates of victimization due to discrimination exhibit no clear pattern and are flat over time. We conclude by demonstrating that discrimination beliefs have significant implications for systemic trust, anxiety, and policy preferences.","[Jones, Bradford; Vannette, David] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Polit Sci, 1 Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Victor, Kristina Flores] Calif State Univ Sacramento, Dept Polit Sci, Sacramento, CA 95819 USA; [Vannette, David] Univ Calif Davis, Qualtr Methodol Lab, 1 Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA",,"Jones, B (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Dept Polit Sci, 1 Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",bsjjones@ucdavis.edu; kristinam.victor@gmail.com; dave.vannette@gmail.com,,,,,,,38,9,9,0,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0092-5853,1540-5907,,AM J POLIT SCI,Am.

By treating journalistic objectivity not as a stable referent, but as a contextual one prone to shifts in practices and understandings over time, it foregrounds how changing technologies of recording, creating, and distributing news content affect how journalistic objectivity is understood. Following this perspective, two technological practices are examined: photojournalism and algorithms. The development of photojournalism led to the prizing of news images as objective representations produced by the camera to the diminishment of human judgment. Similarly, the various outputs produced by news algorithms are accompanied by an orientation toward computational objectivity in contrast to human subjectivity. Exploring these dynamics sheds light on the ongoing relationship between news technologies and discourses of journalistic objectivity in the face of digital innovations in the production and circulation of news.","[Carlson, Matt] Univ Minnesota, Hubbard Sch Journalism & Mass Commun, Minneapolis, MN USA",,"Carlson, M (corresponding author), Univ Minnesota, 111 Murphy Hall,206 Church St SE, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.",carlson1@umn.edu,,,,,,,85,21,21,5,25,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

It complements and extends previous conceptualizations in research on alternative media and outlines an umbrella definition of this phenomenon aimed to inspire contemporary research and scholarly debate. Previous research has been guided by a progressive perspective as a form of resistance against bourgeois hegemonic discourse. Such normative evaluations have in turn limited how the phenomenon has been studied empirically, by limiting the scope of research so that important contemporary phenomena fall outside the theoretical map. Conceptualizing alternative news media in the present hybrid and polarized media environment, we first propose a non-normative, multilevel relational definition: Alternative news media position themselves as correctives of the mainstream news media, as expressed in editorial agendas or statements and/or are perceived as such by their audiences or third-parties. This counter-hegemonic alternativeness can emerge on the macro-level of societal function, the meso-level of organizations and/or the micro-level of news content and producers. Second, demonstrating why this umbrella definition is fruitful in the changing media environment characterized by boundary struggles, crisis in legacy news media and mushrooming of alternative news outlets, we highlight research gaps and propose future research.","[Holt, Kristoffer] Gulf Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Mass Commun & Media MCM, Kuwait, Kuwait; [Figenschou, Tine Ustad] Oslo Metropolitan Univ, Dept Journalism & Media Studies, Oslo, Norway; [Frischlich, Lena] Univ Munster, Dept Commun, Munster, Germany",,"Holt, K (corresponding author), Gulf Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Mass Commun & Media MCM, Kuwait, Kuwait.",Holt.A@gust.edu.kw,"Frischlich, Lena/U-7842-2019; Holt, Kristoffer/G-5575-2019; Holt, Kristoffer/S-9693-2019","Frischlich, Lena/0000-0001-5039-5301; Holt, Kristoffer/0000-0003-2017-1117; Holt, Kristoffer/0000-0003-2017-1117",,,,,26,95,95,16,28,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

Decolonial thinkers often invoke pre-colonial traditions in their efforts to fashion national cultures- modes of being, understanding, and self-expression specific to a de-colonizing collectivity's experience. While the substantive contributions of precolonial traditions to decolonial thought have received well-deserved attention in postcolonial and comparative political theory, this paper focuses on the role that interpretive methods play in generating the emancipatory sensibilities envisioned by decolonial thinkers. It draws on the contemporary Moroccan philosopher Mohammed 'Abed Al-Jabri's interpretive method to show that its decolonial potential lies in its reader-centric approach. This approach is concerned with transforming its postcolonial reader's relationship to precolonial traditions, and not only with establishing the truth of historical texts or making use of their insights in the present as is more common in political-theoretical modes of interpretation. It does so through a tripartite process of disconnection, reconnection, and praxis.","[Daifallah, Yasmeen] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Polit Sci, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA",,"Daifallah, Y (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Polit Sci, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA.",ydaifall@ucsc.edu,,"Daifallah, Yasmeen/0000-0002-7417-8616",,,,,75,1,2,0,4,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0003-0554,1537-5943,,AM POLIT SCI REV,Am.

The article proposes that a large number of meaning-pattern combinations can be identified as constructions. This endeavour assists and is assisted by the derivation of a local grammar of evaluation. The grammar is made explicit in 22 'Analyses', grouped into five main categories. It includes discussion around the process of mapping meaning on to pattern, the consideration of borderline cases, and the debate around naming of elements. This contributes to a comparison of different approaches to phraseology, and in particular to the place of Construction Grammar in relation to more output-oriented approaches.

The activity involved a three-part pedagogical structure, where learners first prepared for and then participated in real-life service encounters, and later reflected on their experiences back in the classroom. The analysis details how the co-constructed telling sequences through which novice second language users re-enact their experiences create an occasion for language-focused activity. We argue that the actions through which the participants display and sustain an orientation to an interactional practice as an object of learning make visible a learning project. The findings illuminate the practices through which language-focused activity is initiated, sustained, and managed to enable in situ learning. They also show how re-enactments function in storytelling and display a novice learner's interactional competence. Finally, the findings illustrate how experiences gained in everyday social activities can be 'harvested and reflected upon' (Wagner 2015: 77) in the classroom and contribute to recent initiatives to develop teaching practices that support learning in-the-wild.","[Lilja, Niina] Univ Tampere, Tampere 33014, Finland; [Piirainen-Marsh, Arja] Univ Jyvaskyla, Dept Languages, English, Jyvaskyla, Finland",,"Lilja, N (corresponding author), Univ Tampere, Tampere 33014, Finland.",niina.lilja@uta.fi,"ARSLAN, Okan/AAA-3232-2020","Piirainen-Marsh, Arja/0000-0001-9898-3444; Lilja, Niina/0000-0003-0360-1584",,,,,61,5,5,1,18,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0142-6001,1477-450X,,APPL LINGUIST,Appl.

This article considers this question in light of a recently developed view that criminal disenfranchisement is justified because it expresses our commitment to democratic values. We call this view expressive disenfranchisement and refer to the general conception in which it is grounded as democratic expressivism. Contra supporters of expressive disenfranchisement, we argue that democratic expressivism does not offer a sound justification of criminal disenfranchisement. Additionally, we argue that, insofar as one really cares about answering serious criminal wrongs via an expression of democratic values, criminal disenfranchisement should be abandoned and replaced with a policy that temporarily obliges the relevant criminals to vote. Democratic expressivists should, in other words, move from supporting the disenfranchisement of serious offenders to endorsing a policy of compulsory criminal voting for a finite period of time.","[Poama, Andrei] Leiden Univ, Fac Governance & Global Affairs, Leiden, Netherlands; [Theuns, Tom] Univ Utrecht, Utrecht, Netherlands; [Theuns, Tom] Univ Coll Roosevelt, Middelburg, Netherlands; [Theuns, Tom] Sci Po Paris, Ctr European Studies & Comparat Polit, Paris, France",,"Poama, A (corresponding author), Leiden Univ, Fac Governance & Global Affairs, Leiden, Netherlands.",a.poama@fgga.leidenuniv.nl; t.j.h.theuns@uu.nl,,"Theuns, Tom/0000-0002-8838-3397",European Union [727112],European Union(European Commission),Tom Theuns would like to acknowledge funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under grant agreement No. 727112 since February 2018.,,62,4,4,0,2,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0003-0554,1537-5943,,AM POLIT SCI REV,Am.

Most studies dealing with political text consider how such texts communicate content, rather than the structural characteristics of texts themselves. The current study focuses on complexity as one of the focal structural characteristics of political text. Previous research showed that different types of textual complexity affect learning processes. Such prior studies are, however, limited both conceptually and empirically. This study addresses these gaps by employing a large-scale experimental design (N= 822), investigating how different dimensions of textual complexity affect factual and structural political knowledge, and whether such relationships are mediated through perceived complexity. Results indicate that different levels (high vs. low) and different dimensions of textual complexity (semantic vs. syntactic) influence reader's perception of text, as well as their factual and structural knowledge. Only semantic complexity has an effect on one's perceived complexity, which in turn negatively affects factual and structural knowledge. Syntactic complexity directly lowered one's factual knowledge acquisition, while there was no direct effect of syntactic complexity on structural knowledge. The results suggest that text complexity indeed plays an important role in political information acquisition, and our findings also highlight the importance of perception in mediating the structural effects of the text.","[Tolochko, Petro] Univ Vienna, Dept Polit Sci, Vienna, Austria; [Song, Hyunjin] Univ Vienna, Dept Commun, Rathausstr 19-1-9, A-1010 Vienna, Austria; [Boomgaarden, Hajo] Univ Vienna, Dept Commun, Empir Social Sci Methods Focus Text Anal, Vienna, Austria",,"Tolochko, P (corresponding author), Univ Vienna, Dept Commun, Rathausstr 19-1-9, A-1010 Vienna, Austria.",petro.tolochko@univie.ac.at,,"Boomgaarden, Hajo G./0000-0002-5260-1284; Tolochko, Petro/0000-0001-5971-8816",,,,,59,7,7,1,9,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1058-4609,1091-7675,,POLIT COMMUN,Polit.

The focus is on how these features of interaction are organized online and across online platforms and how the interactional practices may orient to particular affordances of the platforms. The debates around the use of CA terminology when analyzing online interaction are also discussed. Overall, this review suggests that CA can offer in-depth evidence about the nature of online interaction and so can contribute to wider debates about the role of technology in society. At the same time, through analyzing online interaction there is the possibility for understanding how interactional practices arise and develop over time.

Complexity has been identified as a promising, but methodologically problematic, task design feature. A study was conducted of the effects of progressive increases in the complexity (operationalized as number of elements) of three versions of each of three tasks on the syntactic complexity and lexical diversity of the speech of 42 English native speakers. Data on native speaker performance are important because they reveal task complexity effects unfiltered by non-native competence. Independent evidence that greater task complexity increased cognitive load was shown by participant self-ratings of perceived difficulty, mental effort, and stress, shorter prospective duration estimates and, using dual-task methodology, slower reaction times. Mid-complex versions of the three tasks elicited the most complex syntactic structures, and the most complex versions elicited the greatest lexical diversity. Implications are noted for the design of parallel studies with non-native speakers, along with suggested methodological improvements for future research with native and non-native populations.","[Lee, Jiyong] Univ Maryland, College Pk, MD 20742 USA",,"Lee, J (corresponding author), Univ Maryland, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",jlee0123@umd.edu,,,,,,,49,10,10,3,22,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0142-6001,1477-450X,,APPL LINGUIST,Appl.

However, despite the large amount of research on ER, there is still a lack of studies that show how or whether students accomplish learning during ER activities. To begin to fill this gap, this study applies a conversation analytic lens to investigate cases of local L2 learning and linguistic development during ER book club interactions. The analysis of the selected excerpts shows how the participants themselves shift the interactional focus from book talk to a lexical item during talk-in-interaction (i.e. orientation to learning), and how they deploy the learning object in subsequent speech events (i.e. short-term development). The analysis also shows how the participants orient to emergent learning objects from several different angles (e.g. pronunciation, meaning, spelling, and morphological form).","[Ro, Eunseok] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Second Language Studies, PhD Program, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA",,"Ro, E (corresponding author), Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Second Language Studies, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.",eunseokr@hawaii.edu,,"RO, Eunseok/0000-0002-7914-7704",,,,,63,7,7,1,39,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0142-6001,1477-450X,,APPL LINGUIST,Appl.

Traditionally, research on the linguistic abilities of persons with dementia is either observational (reports kept by caregivers) or experimental (e.g. based on comprehension tasks), and the focus is not on the syntactic competence of the speaker. We combine insights from corpus-based syntactic analysis with methods from interactional approaches. Our close syntactic analysis of the talk of 20 persons diagnosed with dementia and their non-impaired co-participants document both grammatical accuracy and the range of linguistic complexity produced as compared to patterns reported in studies of non-impaired speakers. We note the selection of complex grammatical structures (i.e. verbal arguments) is largely a consequence of the interaction rather than evidence of linguistic decrement. We report on the most pertinent of these interactional influences. Our findings support strategies that promote complex linguistic and interactional talk with persons diagnosed with dementia. We believe that these strategies will help increase the interactional opportunities that are lacking as reported by and about persons residing in an assisted living facility (Brooker 2011).","[Stickle, Trini] Western Kentucky Univ, English, Bowling Green, KY 42101 USA; [Wanner, Anja] Univ Wisconsin, English Linguist, Madison, WI 53706 USA",,"Stickle, T (corresponding author), Western Kentucky Univ, Dept English, 1906 Coll Hts Blvd 11086, Bowling Green, KY 42101 USA.",trini.stickle@wku.edu; awanner@wisc.edu,,,Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research and Graduate Education at the University of Wisconsin-Madison; Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation [140192],Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research and Graduate Education at the University of Wisconsin-Madison; Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation,The authors would like to thank the audience at the 3rd Conference of the International Society for the Linguistics of English for valuable feedback and the Carolina Conversation Collection's team for giving us access to their corpus.

This article analyzes attempts to detheorize nationalism, arguing that they serve three major functions. First, they free nationalists from universalizing their arguments and from the ensuing rights and obligations. Second, they allow its rivals to present nationalism as morally inferior to other political standpoints. Third, they lead to the singling out and legitimization of one specific form of nationalism that is principle driven. Drawing a line between forms of nationalism-those motivated by primordial feelings and those motivated by rational and universal principles-lays the groundwork for a distinction between ethnic and civic nationalism. Though in theory these are two distinct forms of nationalism, in reality the boundaries are blurred. And yet advocates of civic nationalism keep the distinction alive, wishing to distance themselves from the other form of nationalism and promoting a vision (some would say the illusion) of a nationless nationalism. Assuming thatWestern democracies have transcended their national and ethnic elements encourages politicians to ignore social schisms, avoiding the need to cope with their consequences. The civic language therefore not only is theoretically inaccurate but also motivates avoidance where action is needed.","[Tamir, Yael (Yuli)] Shenkar Coll, IL-5252626 Ramat Gan, Israel; [Tamir, Yael (Yuli)] Univ Oxford, Blavatnik Sch Govt, Oxford OX2 6GG, England",,"Tamir, Y (corresponding author), Shenkar Coll, IL-5252626 Ramat Gan, Israel.;Tamir, Y (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Blavatnik Sch Govt, Oxford OX2 6GG, England.",yuli@shenkar.ac.il,,,,,,,38,17,18,4,13,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1094-2939,1545-1577,,ANNU REV POLIT SCI,Annu.

An Exemplary Study for the Vocabulary and Fluency Scales in a Language Testing Context,APPLIED LINGUISTICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,CEFR,"In spite of the widespread use of Common European Framework of Reference for language learning, teaching, and assessment (CEFR) scales, there is an overwhelming lack of evidence regarding their power to describe empirical learner language (Fulcher 2004; Hulstijn 2007). This article presents results of a study that focused on the empirical robustness (i.e. the power of level descriptions to capture what learners actually do in a language test) of the CEFR vocabulary & fluency scales (A2-B2). Data stem from an Italian & German oral proficiency test (Abel et al. 2012). Results show that the empirical robustness was flawed: Some scale contents were hardly observable or so evenly distributed that they could not distinguish between learners. Contradictory/weak correlations among scale features and heterogeneous cluster solutions suggest that scales did not consistently capture typical learner behaviour. Often, learner language could not be objectively described by any level description. Also, it was only partially possible to link scale contents to research-based measures of fluency and vocabulary. Given the importance of CEFR levels in many high-stakes contexts, the results suggest the need of a large empirical validation project.","[Wisniewski, Katrin] Univ Leipzig, Herder Inst German Foreign Language, Leipzig, Germany",,"Wisniewski, K (corresponding author), Univ Leipzig, Herder Inst German Foreign Language, Leipzig, Germany.",katrin.wisniewski@uni-leipzig.de,,"Wisniewski, Katrin/0000-0003-4124-2543",,,,,69,6,6,4,33,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0142-6001,1477-450X,,APPL LINGUIST,Appl.

From proclamations about the death of 'Man' to investigations into enhanced forms of being, from the advent of the Anthropocene (human-induced planetary change) to new forms of materialism and distributed cognition, posthumanism raises significant questions for applied linguistics in terms of our understandings of language, humans, objects, and agency. After reviewing the broad field of post-humanist thought, this paper investigates-through an overview of a series of recent research projects-the notion of repertoire, to show how this can be better understood by stepping out of the humanist constructs of the individual and the community and looking instead at the notion of distributed language and spatial repertoires. The paper concludes by discussing the implications of posthumanism for applied linguistics, in particular the ways we understand language in relation to people, objects, and place.","[Pennycook, Alastair] Univ Technol Sydney, Fac Arts & Social Sci, Sydney, NSW, Australia",,"Pennycook, A (corresponding author), Univ Technol Sydney, Fac Arts & Social Sci, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",Alastair.pennycook@uts.edu.au,,"Pennycook, Alastair/0000-0002-4656-6187",,,,,76,99,103,17,60,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0142-6001,1477-450X,,APPL LINGUIST,Appl.

First, we conceptualize and measure secular orientations in a new way-not just as the absence of religion, but also as an affirmative secular identity and positive commitment to secular principles. Second, our panel and experimental data allow for the most definitive test to date of whether political orientations exert a causal effect on religious and secular orientations.

First, computational models generally do not employ the language or modes of analysis common to game-theoretic models, the status quo in the literature. I detail the types of insights typically derived from game-theoretic models and discuss analogues in computational modeling. Second, there are not widely established procedures for analysis of deductive computational models. I present a regularized method for deriving comparative statics from computational models that provides insights comparable to those arising from game-theoretic analyses. It also serves as a framework for building theoretically tractable computational models.

We hypothesized that implicit inclusive leader language promotes voice especially among team members sharing the same professional group membership as the leader (in-group team members) while explicit inclusive leader language promotes voice especially among team members belonging to a different professional group (out-group team members). These hypotheses were tested in a field setting in which 126 health care professionals (i.e., nurses, resident and attending physicians), organized in 26 teams, managed medical emergencies. Behavioral coding and leader language analyses supported our hypotheses: Leaders' WE-references were more strongly related to residents' (in-group) and explicit invitations related more strongly to nurses' (out-group) voice behavior.

Far from supporting convergence, then, the stability question demands revision of the view. This response develops these objections, extends them from Kogelmann and Stich's analysis to other convergence theorists and political liberals, and explores what political theorists can learn from convergence's difficulties.","[Hertzberg, Benjamin R.] Emory Univ, Polit Sci, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA",,"Hertzberg, BR (corresponding author), Emory Univ, Polit Sci, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA.",bhertzberg@emory.edu,,,,,,,29,1,1,0,5,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0003-0554,1537-5943,,AM POLIT SCI REV,Am.

The main concern that has been raised in this connection is that the complexity of political processes is being reduced to achievements and standpoints of individual politicians, and the importance of rational opinion building is discounted. The results of the current study provide the first empirical evidence to account for the misgivings about emotional effects of personalized political information on media audiences. Using data from an online experiment, this study shows that news coverage regarding behaviors and personal characteristics of a foreign leader influences (a) evaluations of personal characteristics typical of his or her nation's citizens and (b) emotional perceptions of that leader's country (sentiment and respect). This effect is shown to reflect a psychological phenomenon whereby people project their emotions and perceptions regarding a leader's personal characteristics onto his or her country and people.","[Balmas, Meital] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Commun, IL-91905 Jerusalem, Israel",,"Balmas, M (corresponding author), Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Commun, IL-91905 Jerusalem, Israel.",meitalbalmas@gmail.com,,,German-Israeli Foundation for Scientific Research and Development [2366],German-Israeli Foundation for Scientific Research and Development(German-Israeli Foundation for Scientific Research and Development),"The author is grateful to Tamir Sheafer, Ifat Maoz, Jon Krosnick, and Raanan Sulitzeanu-Kenan for help, comments, and advice on earlier versions of this article.

We examine the effect of one-sided and competing war discourses on ordinary people's understandings of the Syrian civil war-a conflict with multiple narratives, but which has become more communal over time. We conduct a framing experiment with a representative sample of Syrian refugees in Lebanon in which we vary the narrative that describes the reasons for the conflict.

Structuralism encouraged scholars to consider language, like other social constructs, as organized as a self-defining and closed structure, set apart from spatiotemporal 'context' (which included diverse considerations such as history, geography, politics, and society). Translingualism calls for a shift from these structuralist assumptions to consider more mobile, expansive, situated, and holistic practices. In this article, I articulate how a poststructuralist paradigm might help us theorize and practice translingualism according to a spatial orientation that embeds communication in space and time, considering all resources as working together as an assemblage in shaping meaning. I illustrate from my ongoing research with international STEM scholars in a Midwestern American university to theorize how translingualism will redefine the role of constructs such as language, non-verbal artifacts, and context in communicative proficiency.","[Canagarajah, Suresh] Penn State Univ, Dept Appl Linguist, 303 Sparks Bldg, University Pk, PA 16803 USA",,"Canagarajah, S (corresponding author), Penn State Univ, Dept Appl Linguist, 303 Sparks Bldg, University Pk, PA 16803 USA.",asc16@psu.edu,,,,,,,47,142,144,6,61,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0142-6001,1477-450X,,APPL LINGUIST,Appl.

Responding to this discrepancy, we conducted two experiments (N = 562 and N = 558) in which we manipulated the core idea of populist messages-attributing blame-in forced and selective exposure media environments. Our results demonstrate that citizens higher in relative deprivation are most likely to select populist messages. Irrespective of selective exposure, citizens' populist attitudes are only positively affected if the populist message is congruent with their prior feelings of relative deprivation.

While this scholarship has been developed primarily in the contexts of world Englishes, English as a lingua franca, and bilingual education in Anglophone nations, its implications to foreign language education in higher education have not been fully explored. The current article addresses this issue by shedding light on the conditions of teaching and learning of indigenous languages spoken in once-colonized regions of the world as an additional language for English speakers. More specifically, it examines how American students who participated in an eight-week YorA(1)ba study abroad program in Nigeria navigated a rather conspicuous gap between a monolingual utopia promoted by the program and the complex translingual realities of everyday language use outside of the classroom. Through the review of the perspectives of students with diverse backgrounds, the article discusses the significance of taking sociohistorical and geopolitical contexts surrounding the target language into account to cultivate informed learners.","[Mori, Junko; Sanuth, Kazeem Kehinde] Univ Wisconsin Madison, Madison, WI 53706 USA",,"Mori, J (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin Madison, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",jmori@wisc.edu,,,,,,,49,11,11,0,17,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0142-6001,1477-450X,,APPL LINGUIST,Appl.

One particular aspect of multilingual language users' social interaction that I want to emphasize is its multimodal and multisensory nature.

Whining is primarily a vernacular category, but it can be identified in terms of a set of phonetic features including pitch movement, loudness and nasality, and contrasted with crying. We focus on the uses and consequences of whining, in and for social interaction. Rather than identifying and attributing experiential causes or correlates of whining, we examine what children do with it, how it is occasioned, and how others, mostly parents, respond to it. Whining performs actions such as objecting to transgressions and thwarted goals and making complaints. Parental reactions include one or more of: stance inversion, which is the adoption of a contrasting tone in next turn; formulations of the offending circumstances; orientations to remedying the problem; and rejection of the whine's basis, including dispositional formulations of the child's whining (e.g., being grumpy) and accounts for not complying with a called-for remedy.

A content analysis (n = 612) of all published news stories over two years in four international news databases revealed the potential of journalists to embrace data as an empirical tool, for the phrase was most frequently associated with numerical analysis. However, the next most-frequent definitional category was electoral prediction, which was statistically more likely in the nations where data journalism is most often practiced, the U.K. and U.S. Correlating data journalism with electoral prediction also was statistically more likely in the month immediately after the surprising elections. Further, it was more likely to stimulate pushback from practitioners who saw data as epistemologically less reliable than shoe-leather approaches marked by observation and interviews with a few people perceived to be voter archetypes. The results reveal more than journalistic ignorance about polling techniques. They reveal an element of news culture that privileges traditional methods and dismisses unfamiliar evidentiary tools, which risks skewing audience understanding of data journalism.","[Lewis, Norman P.; Waters, Stephenson] Univ Florida, Dept Journalism, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA",,"Lewis, NP (corresponding author), Univ Florida, Dept Journalism, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",nplewis@ufl.edu; stephensonwaters@ufl.edu,"Waters, Stephenson/K-9762-2019","Waters, Stephenson/0000-0001-7484-604X",,,,,82,14,14,2,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

While a growing number of media and communication studies projects have applied these techniques to corpuses of born-digital journalism, using the same tools to analyse large-scale collections of historical newspapers requires us to overcome additional technological and methodological challenges. Our discussion is framed around a historical case study examining references to the United States in the 19th Century British Library Newspaper Archive. The article begins by highlighting the problems that researchers of both digital and historical journalism face when attempting to deal with an enormous body of evidence. Next, it argues that Topic Modelling offers one potential solution to these problems by providing a way to distant read the archive. The remainder of the article is divided into five experiments that demonstrate how Topic Modelling can be applied to a series of research questions, each of which is applicable to other projects that might make use of newspaper archives. As well as demonstrating the investigative potential of topic modelling, the article also highlights the practical and technological barriers that currently undermine its effectiveness, particularly when it is applied to archives of historical material.","[Van Galen, Quintus; Nicholson, Bob] Edge Hill Univ, Dept English Hist & Creat Writing, St Helens Rd, Ormskirk L39 4QP, England",,"Nicholson, B (corresponding author), Edge Hill Univ, Dept English Hist & Creat Writing, St Helens Rd, Ormskirk L39 4QP, England.",Vangaleq@edgehill.ac.uk; bob.nicholso-n@edgehill.ac.uk,,,,,,,39,1,1,2,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

This article contends that we are witnessing a third wave toward the rationalization of audience understanding and distinguishes between audience analytics (systems that capture information) and audience metrics (quantified measures output by those systems). The body of literature on analytics and metrics in the context of news production is then synthesized across the ABCDE of news production: attitudes, behaviors, content, discourse, and ethics. That synthesis leads to an overarching conclusion that while contemporary journalism is not being driven by quantified audiences, both audiences and quantification are playing far more prominent roles in news production than in the past. Scholars and practitioners have also become less pessimistic about analytics and metrics over time, recognizing more nuanced effects and prosocial possibilities. Finally, important gaps in the literature are identified and new research directions proposed to help address them.","[Zamith, Rodrigo] Univ Massachusetts Amherst, Journalism Dept, Amherst, MA 01003 USA",,"Zamith, R (corresponding author), Univ Massachusetts Amherst, Journalism Dept, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.",rzamith@umass.edu,,"Zamith, Rodrigo/0000-0001-8114-1734",,,,,53,67,68,3,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

It describes the teaching of Turkish to Greek-Cypriots, introduced in 2003 by the Republic of Cyprus as part of a de-securitization policy. Although these classes were optional, many students regarded Turks as enemies, and after documenting hostility itself as one motive for learning Turkish, we describe three teaching strategies used to deal with the powerful emotions that Turkish evoked: (i) focusing on the language as a code, shorn of any cultural association; (ii) treating it as a local language; and (iii) presenting it as a contemporary international language in a cosmopolitan ambience that potentially transcended the island-specific conflict. In this way, the Cypriot case calls mainstream language teaching assumptions into question: exclusively grammar-focused pedagogies display acute cultural sensitivity, and images of language in a globalized world look radical and innovative. For intercultural language education more generally, it is the combination of institutionalised language learning as a distinct cultural activity with the ideological plasticity of language itself that seems especially valuable.","[Charalambous, Panayiota; Charalambous, Constadina] European Univ Cyprus, Engomi, Cyprus; [Rampton, Ben] Kings Coll London, London, England",,"Rampton, B (corresponding author), Kings Coll London, London, England.",ben.rampton@kcl.ac.uk,"Charalambous, Constadina/AAC-6647-2019","Charalambous, Constadina/0000-0003-3326-0055; Rampton, Ben/0000-0002-2437-1944",,,,,58,12,12,1,16,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0142-6001,1477-450X,,APPL LINGUIST,Appl.

Habermas on Religious Translation and Cooperative Learning in Post-secular Society,AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,,PUBLIC SPHERE,"This article evaluates Jurgen Habermas's attempt to reopen political liberalism to religion. In trying to take religion seriously, Habermas goes further than John Rawls and other liberal theorists by affirming that religious traditions articulate truths on which democratic societies continue to depend for their civic and moral health. Post-secular societies, in his view, should learn from religion by translating its moral intuitions into universal secular language. Although Habermas in this way appears friendlier to religion than Rawls, unlike Rawls he also calls for the modernization of religious consciousness. This theological transformation not only reveals the foundationalist presuppositions of liberalism, but also points to a highly attenuated conception of learning from religion. Taking religion seriously will require us to be open to its insights not only when they agree with, but especially when they challenge, our secular presuppositions. This dimension of religion is at risk of getting lost in translation in the Habermasian paradigm.","[Areshidze, Giorgi] Claremont Mckenna Coll, Govt, Claremont, CA 91711 USA",,"Areshidze, G (corresponding author), Claremont Mckenna Coll, Govt, Claremont, CA 91711 USA.",giorgi.areshidze@gmail.com,,,,,,,86,7,7,0,8,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0003-0554,1537-5943,,AM POLIT SCI REV,Am.

Although redemptive violence had roots in prerevolutionary notions of penal justice and social cohesion, its philosophical ambitions were revolutionary and modern.

However, some of its purported benefits still need to be empirically confirmed. Thus, while this approach is widely believed to positively influence students' affective stance, research studies are scant, and hardly any are longitudinal in nature. In an attempt to fill this gap, the present longitudinal study aims to analyse the impact of CLIL on different affective components. The participants are 304 secondary education students who were enrolled in CLIL and non-CLIL programmes. Contrary to expectations and the reviewed literature, the downward motivational trend observed in non-CLIL students in previous studies was not found. The results also indicate that CLIL does not help to sustain students' motivation over time, but motivation to learn the subject matter is maintained in CLIL classes.","[Lasagabaster, David; Doiz, Aintzane] Univ Basque Country UPV EHU, Leoia, Bizkaia, Spain",,"Lasagabaster, D (corresponding author), Univ Basque Country UPV EHU, Leoia, Bizkaia, Spain.",david.lasagabaster@ehu.es,"Lasagabaster, David/ABF-5911-2020","Lasagabaster, David/0000-0001-7750-2314; Doiz, Aintzane/0000-0002-4818-6495",Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [FFI2012-34214]; Basque Government [IT311-10]; UPV/EHU [UFI11/06],Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government); Basque Government(Basque Government); UPV/EHU,"The results presented in this article are part of the following research projects: FFI2012-34214 (Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness), IT311-10 (Basque Government), and UFI11/06 (UPV/EHU).

Drawing on linguistic-ethnographic analysis of the way English is treated as an invariable 'ad hoc' idiom in the Belgian asylum interview, this article demonstrates how institutional measures and routines relating to multilingualism fail to address the communicative needs and practices of the participants involved. I argue that by privileging the variety of the host institution as a means to monitor all incoming Englishes, the institution perpetuates traditional-though academically contested-centre-periphery categorizations of global Englishes. I proceed by discussing how the divergent potentialities of the speakers' linguistic repertoires reflect a remarkable inversion of client-gatekeeper resources in the way the participants with the least linguistic resources in the interview process eventually have the power to act as arbiters of what is or is not institutionally relevant for the case.","[Maryns, Katrijn] Univ Ghent, FWO Res Fdn Flanders, Blandijnberg 2, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium",,"Maryns, K (corresponding author), Univ Ghent, FWO Res Fdn Flanders, Blandijnberg 2, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.",katrijn.maryns@ugent.be,"Maryns, Katrijn/P-2184-2015","Maryns, Katrijn/0000-0002-8919-3050",FWO Research Foundation Flanders,FWO Research Foundation Flanders(FWO),This study was supported by doctoral and postdoctoral grants from the FWO Research Foundation Flanders.

Many of these bilinguals are also exposed to and identify with at least two cultures. Because language knowledge enables participation in cultural practices and expression of cultural beliefs, bilingual experience and cultural identity are interconnected. However, the specific links between bilingualism and cultural identity remain largely unidentified. The current study examined which aspects of bilingualism relate to identification with first-and second-language cultures. Two hundred and nine bilinguals completed a questionnaire probing linguistic background and cultural affiliations. Regression analyses indicated that cultural identification was predicted by age of language acquisition, language proficiency, foreign accentedness, and contexts of long-term language immersion and current language exposure. Follow-up analyses revealed that the language-culture relations were mediated by the age and manner in which the second language was acquired. These findings are situated within a proposed framework of bilingual cultural identity. By identifying features of bilingualism that are relevant for cultural identity, the current research increases our understanding of the relationship between language and culture.","[Schroeder, Scott R.; Lam, Tuan Q.; Marian, Viorica] Northwestern Univ, Dept Commun Sci & Disorders, Evanston, IL 60208 USA",,"Schroeder, SR (corresponding author), Northwestern Univ, Dept Commun Sci & Disorders, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",schroeder@u.northwestern.edu,,"Marian, Viorica/0000-0002-8335-1433",NICHD [1R01HD059858]; EUNICE KENNEDY SHRIVER NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF CHILD HEALTH & HUMAN DEVELOPMENT [R01HD059858] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER,NICHD(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD)); EUNICE KENNEDY SHRIVER NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF CHILD HEALTH & HUMAN DEVELOPMENT(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD)),"The authors thank Anthony Shook, James Bartolotti, Sarah Chabal, Jennifer Krizman, Max Freeman, and Marcella Lowell for their contributions to the current study.

In foregrounding the concept of Spracherleben, the lived experience of language, this article contributes to the ongoing debate on how to rethink the notion of the linguistic repertoire considering that current phenomena such as increased mobility, migration, or participation in transnational networks of communication make it difficult to take, as Gumperz (1964) did in his original concept, relatively stable speech communities as point of departure. The notion of the lived experience of language which I am elaborating here emphasizes the intersubjective dimension of language as a gesture toward the other and casts light on the often-neglected bodily and emotional dimensions of perception and speech. Attaching particular importance to the perspective of the experiencing subject, the concept is based on phenomenological approaches, as developed in the 1940s by the French philosopher Merleau-Ponty.","[Busch, Brigitta] Univ Vienna, Dept Linguist, Vienna, Austria",,"Busch, B (corresponding author), Univ Vienna, Dept Linguist, Vienna, Austria.",brigitta.busch@univie.ac.at,,,,,,,48,89,91,2,21,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0142-6001,1477-450X,,APPL LINGUIST,Appl.

Many theories posit that information flows more easily in ethnically homogeneous areas, facilitating collective action, because social networks among coethnics are denser. Although this characterization is ubiquitous, little empirical work assesses it. Through a novel field experiment in a matched pair of villages in rural Uganda, this article directly examines word-of-mouth information spread and its relationship to ethnic diversity and networks. As expected, information spread more widely in the homogeneous village. However, unexpectedly, the more diverse village's network is significantly denser. Using unusually detailed network data, we offer an explanation for why network density may hamper information dissemination in heterogeneous areas, showing why even slight hesitation to share information with people from other groups can have large aggregate effects.","[Larson, Jennifer M.] NYU, Dept Polit, Polit, 19 W 4th St, New York, NY 10012 USA; [Lewis, Janet I.] US Naval Acad, Dept Polit Sci, Polit Sci, 589 McNair Rd, Annapolis, MD 21402 USA",,"Larson, JM (corresponding author), NYU, Dept Polit, Polit, 19 W 4th St, New York, NY 10012 USA.",jenn.larson@nyu.edu; janetilewis@gmail.com,,"Larson, Jennifer/0000-0001-7681-2935; Lewis, Janet/0000-0001-7275-8791",Harvard's Institute for Quantitative Social Science,Harvard's Institute for Quantitative Social Science,"We thank Robert Bates, Andrew Coe, Nick Eubank, Guy Grossman, Lorien Jasny, Michael Joseph, Zane Kelly, Armando Razo, Pedro Rodriguez, Dustin Tingley, Stefan Wojcik, Josef Woldense, and especially Pia Raffler for helpful comments on pieces of this project.

The focus is on the resolution of intra-sentential anaphora and cataphora in Italian by two groups of native speakers, English-Italian trainee translators and a control group of non-translators. The participants did a picture selection task in which they had to identify the antecedents of third person null and overt subject pronouns in ambiguous anaphoric and cataphoric conditions. Contrary to what was expected based on previous work, proposing that translators undergo a form of first language attrition due to extended exposure to a second language, trainee translators did not exhibit evidence of overt pronoun overgeneralization (i. e. second language influence). In fact, they selected pragmatically inappropriate antecedents to a lesser extent than the control group, leading to the conclusion that in language comprehension, metalinguistic awareness can override other influences affecting translators.","[Milicevic, Maja] Univ Belgrade, Fac Philol, Appl Linguist, Dept Gen Linguist, Belgrade, Serbia; [Kras, Tihana] Univ Rijeka, Fac Humanities & Social Sci, Dept English Language & Literature, Sveucilisna Ave 4, Rijeka 51000, Croatia",,"Milicevic, M (corresponding author), Univ Belgrade, Fac Philol, Appl Linguist, Dept Gen Linguist, Belgrade, Serbia.",m.milicevic@fil.bg.ac.rs,"Kras, Tihana/S-5581-2018; Petrović, Maja Miličević/ABH-7567-2020","Kras, Tihana/0000-0001-5359-9641; Petrović, Maja Miličević/0000-0003-4137-1898",Italian Government Bursary for Foreign and I.

Internationally, courts, legislators and policy makers are developing new definitions that incorporate a broader understanding of journalism practice, as territories blur and shift across digital spaces. However, a lack of consensus has resulted in jurisdictional clashes, challenges to legislative amendments, appeals to higher courts, and confusion for regulators and practitioners alike. In Australia, recently legislated shield laws have resulted in different definitions across the country's various jurisdictions. In the United States, court cases relating to defamation and shield laws have been successfully appealed based on differing definitions of the role of a journalist. In New Zealand, a High Court judgement overturned a lower court decision, to find that a blogger could be viewed as a journalist. At the same time, courts internationally are developing policies and guidelines relating to live text-based communication from courts, which also requires them to determine who is permitted to text, tweet or blog from within courtroom. This paper examines how these courts, legislators and policy makers are grappling with the challenges of redefining journalist and news media while ultimately focusing on the objective of ensuring a free and democratic flow of information.","[Johnston, Jane] Univ Queensland, Sch Commun & Arts, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Wallace, Anne] Edith Cowan Univ, Sch Business & Law, Churchlands, WA, Australia",,"Johnston, J (corresponding author), Univ Queensland, Sch Commun & Arts, Brisbane, Qld, Australia.",jane.johnston@uq.edu.au; a.wallace@ecu.edu.au,"Johnston, Jane L/H-8090-2016","Johnston, Jane L/0000-0003-1750-3977; Wallace, Anne/0000-0002-3825-9558",,,,,47,16,16,0,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

The data come from a novel corpus of conversations in which participants wore eye-tracking glasses to obtain direct measures of their eye movements. The results show that while most preferred responses are produced with gaze toward the questioner, most dispreferred responses are produced with gaze aversion. We further demonstrate that gaze aversion by respondents can occasion self-repair by questioners in the transition space between turns, indicating that the relationship between gaze direction and preference is more than a mere statistical association. We conclude that gaze direction in responses to polar questions functions as a signal of response preference.

It analyses 1249 news reports mentioning encryption in The Guardian and The New York Times, covering a three-year period from June 2012 to June 2015 (one year before and two years after the Snowden revelations). Whilst there was a marked increase in the volume of news articles mentioning encryption post-Snowden, the context in which encryption is discussed has since shifted from an initial emphasis on surveillance towards security issues. However, the research found that greater news coverage of encryption did not necessarily mean an increase in depth of coverage, with most mentions of encryption vague and non-descript. In terms of source usage, the research finds an emphasis on private corporations in both publications analysed. This is problematic when many of the organisations allowed to speak on encryption were those accused of colluding with the US and UK Governments to aid covert mass surveillance-the likes of Google, Facebook, Apple, Microsoft and so forth-thus providing them with a platform to exonerate themselves from the accusations. This contradictory depiction of communication security serves the status quo and prevents advancement of the  encrypted by default communication practice called for by Snowden. This, by extension, has serious implications for both journalistic freedom and civil liberties since it helps to perpetuate the ability of nation states and corporations to conduct indiscriminate mass surveillance.","[Thorsen, Einar] Bournemouth Univ, Sch Journalism English & Commun, Poole BH12 5BB, Dorset, England",,"Thorsen, E (corresponding author), Bournemouth Univ, Sch Journalism English & Commun, Poole BH12 5BB, Dorset, England.",ethorsen@bournemouth.ac.uk,,,,,,,27,7,7,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

During 6-weeks in Seoul, Julie struggled to gain participation and to define her identity in a setting that was hostile towards homosexuality. These struggles were exacerbated by her Korean class, where she was positioned as an 'older' student and, therefore, consigned to working with a 'sexist' and 'narcissistic' 65-year-old European male ('Peter'). Within this unfavourable socio-historical context, this study focuses on how Julie exerted her agency to modulate her identity and redefine the socialmaterial conditions of her language learning. I argue that through exerting her agency Julie was able to alter the 'rules of interaction' in the 'activity system' that she was part of. As such, Julie's story highlights the significance of acts of 'changing' in defining language learning experiences and emphasizes the role of agency in activity-theoretic approaches to language learning.","[Brown, Lucien] Univ Oregon, East Asian Languages & Literatures, 425 Friendly Hall, Eugene, OR 97403 USA",,"Brown, L (corresponding author), Univ Oregon, East Asian Languages & Literatures, 425 Friendly Hall, Eugene, OR 97403 USA.",lucien@uoregon.edu,,,,,,,31,11,11,1,19,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0142-6001,1477-450X,,APPL LINGUIST,Appl.

In this study, I combine insights from the cultural cognition, affect control theory, and cultural transmission frameworks to examine how one form of internalized culturefundamental cultural sentimentsaffects the content of information shared in communication. I argue that individuals communicate narratives in ways that minimize deflection of internalized cultural sentiments, resulting in cultural-consistency bias. I test this proposition using a serial transmission study in which participants read and retell short stories. Results show that culturally inconsistent, high-deflection information experiences an initial boost in memorability, but consistency biases ultimately win out as information is altered to increase cultural consistency, demonstrating that deflection provides a promising measure of cultural schema-consistency. This measure is predictive of the information that individuals share in communication and changes to this information in the transmission process.","[Hunzaker, M. B.

To illustrate this, we focus on two key Rawlsian concepts: the original position and public reason.

Drawing on data from democratic national and state constitutions, we challenge the consensus among constitutional theorists that a central purpose of constitutionalism is the entrenchment (the fortification against future change) of broad principles. The empirical reality is that the majority of democratic constitutions today are subject to frequent revision, and are therefore ill-equipped to facilitate the entrenchment of their contents. To explore the logic of these unentrenched documents, we identify the historical periods in which different geographic regions moved away from highly entrenched constitutions, and we examine the political contexts of these transformations. We find that, in each context, constitution-makers were attempting to limit the discretion of constitutional interpreters and implementers by drafting highly specific texts and by updating them in response to continually changing circumstances.","[Zackin, Emily] Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Polit, Sci 338 Mergenthaler Hall,3400 N Charles St, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA; [Versteeg, Mila] Univ Virginia, Sch Law, Law, 580 Massie Rd, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA",,"Zackin, E (corresponding author), Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Polit, Sci 338 Mergenthaler Hall,3400 N Charles St, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA.",versteeg@virginia.edu; ezackinl@jhu.edu,,"Versteeg, Mila/0000-0001-5231-9847",,,,,118,42,42,0,18,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0003-0554,1537-5943,,AM POLIT SCI REV,Am.

Forty L1 Spanish - L2 Swedish bilinguals living in Sweden participated in the study, along with 20 functionally monolingual L1 speakers of Spanish. L1 proficiency was measured by means of a grammaticality judgement test (GJT) and language aptitude data were obtained through the LLAMA Language Aptitude Test (Meara 2005). Additional data on the participants' linguistic background were also collected. Results revealed a robust difference in GJT scores between the bilinguals and the control group. However, degree of language aptitude was not found to exert a significant influence on the bilinguals' GJT performance. Instead, the only significant predictor for GJT performance was linguistic identification, showing that those participants with strong L1 identification were more accurate in judging L1 grammaticality.

Gender is often perceived to be a salient identity category among adult L2 learners overseas. Drawing on the language socialization framework (Ochs and Schieffelin 1984), this study focuses on how gender is constructed and indexed through language as the American students learn to use Mandarin sentence-final particles. Sentence-final particles constitute a unique repertoire to achieve affective work in Mandarin. They have further become a resource among China's urban youth to enact a cute female speech style. In this case study, I employ a qualitative approach with an embedded quantitative component to examine the participants' use of the particles over the course of one semester. The findings show how the American students become socialized into using these particles as gendered linguistic practices in the dorm conversations.","[Diao, Wenhao] Univ Arizona, Dept Asian Studies, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA",,"Diao, WH (corresponding author), Univ Arizona, Dept Asian Studies, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA.",wdiao@email.arizona.edu,,,,,,,66,27,27,0,51,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0142-6001,1477-450X,,APPL LINGUIST,Appl.

We focus on what we call mobile-supported sharing activities, in which participants use a mobile phone to share text or images with others by voicing text aloud from their mobile or providing others with visual access to the device's display screen. Drawing from naturalistic video recordings, we focus on how mobile-supported sharing activities invite assessments by providing access to an object that is not locally accessible to the participants. Such practices make relevant coparticipants' assessment of these objects and allow for different forms of coparticipation across sequence types. We additionally examine how the organization of assessments during these sharing activities displays sensitivity to preference structure. The analysis illustrates the relevance of embodiment, local objects, and new communicative technologies to the production of action in copresent interaction.

Originally introduced by Jernudd and NeustupnA1/2 in 1987, as a novel continuation of the language planning tradition stemming from the 1960/70s, language management along these lines has developed into the Language Management Theory (LMT). A second definition of language management, diverting from LMT, can be found in the work of Spolsky, who treats language management as a theoretical component of the wider concept of language policy. Furthermore, over the past 15 years a number of scholars, particularly from the international management discipline, appear to have taken an interest in language as a variable in business and corporate management. It is also common to refer to this research field as language management. This conceptual article offers a theoretically based comparison of the three definitions of language management, before discussing five main focus points, which may be used to highlight their analytical differences.","[Sanden, Guro Refsum] Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Int Business Commun, Dalgas Have 15, DK-2000 Frederiksberg, Denmark",,"Sanden, GR (corresponding author), Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Int Business Commun, Dalgas Have 15, DK-2000 Frederiksberg, Denmark.",grs.ibc@cbs.dk,,"Sanden, Guro/0000-0001-5450-6320",,,,,39,13,13,4,8,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0142-6001,1477-450X,,APPL LINGUIST,Appl.

On the one hand, as has often been recognized, Smith saw a high degree of economic inequality as an inevitable result of a flourishing commercial society, and he considered a certain amount of such inequality to be positively useful as a means of encouraging productivity and bolstering political stability. On the other hand, it has seldom been noticed that Smith also expressed deep worries about some of the other effects of extreme economic inequalityworries that are, moreover, interestingly different from those that dominate contemporary discourse. In Smith's view, extreme economic inequality leads people to sympathize more fully and readily with the rich than the poor, and this distortion in our sympathies in turn undermines both morality and happiness.","[Rasmussen, Dennis C.] Tufts Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Medford, MA 02155 USA",,"Rasmussen, DC (corresponding author), Tufts Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Medford, MA 02155 USA.",dennis.rasmussen@tufts.edu,,,,,,,34,24,24,1,19,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0003-0554,1537-5943,,AM POLIT SCI REV,Am.

It offers an analysis of the way the platform redefines journalism's quality standards against the background of the tension between traditional modernistic claims to truth and competing postmodern ideas on the social construction of knowledge. Moreover, the article examines how these ideals are translated into journalistic texts. The article argues that both in its rhetoric and in its actual practice, the articles in De Correspondent deviate from the principles of quality journalism under the objectivity regime. They are structured around the mediating subjectivity of the journalists and are thus openly subjective. Yet, they also draw on empirical research and scientific knowledge. Moreover, they are transparent about the reporting process, which through their reflection becomes an integral part of the story itself. Thus, being transparent about their combination of different forms of knowledge, rooted in more traditional rational-positivistic inquiry as well as in personal experience and emotion, they try to reconcile the tension between the modernist and postmodernist claims to truth.","[Harbers, Frank] Univ Groningen, Ctr Media & Journalism Studies, NL-9700 AB Groningen, Netherlands",,"Harbers, F (corresponding author), Univ Groningen, Ctr Media & Journalism Studies, NL-9700 AB Groningen, Netherlands.",F.Harbers@rug.nl,,"Harbers, Frank/0000-0003-1578-7582",,,,,63,26,26,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

Our study illustrates how an experimental design can be used to improve measures of exposure.

The examination suggests Burnett's photo aesthetic signifies a longing for an imagined analog, journalistic utopia of yore, where individual journalists had the time and freedom to put care and attention into their work.","[Mendelson, Andrew L.] CUNY, Grad Sch Journalism, New York, NY 10021 USA; [Creech, Brian] Temple Univ, Dept Journalism, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA",,"Mendelson, AL (corresponding author), CUNY, Grad Sch Journalism, New York, NY 10021 USA.",andrew.mendel-son@journalism.cuny.edu; brian.creech@temple.edu,"Creech, Brian/AAR-8116-2021","Creech, Brian/0000-0002-0986-6842",,,,,79,5,6,0,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

J,"Ormen, J",,,,"Ormen, Jacob",,,GOOGLING THE NEWS Opportunities and challenges in studying news events through Google Search,DIGITAL JOURNALISM,,,English,Article,,,,,,algorithm; Google; news event; personalisation; search results,,"Search engines provide a window into the changing association between websites and keywords across cultures and countries and over time. As such, they offer journalism and news researchers an opportunity to study how search engines, in this case Google, mediate news events and stories online. However, search results are not straightforward to study. Since search results are made in the act of searching and will have to be retrieved from Google Search in real-time, there is a range of different ontological and methodological issues related to this data source. This paper addresses these issues by discussing how factors in the search algorithm can be used proactively to study variations across searchers and in time. The paper identifies various endogenous and exogenous factors in the search algorithm one has to pay attention to and discusses ways to archive search results accordingly. Through a small case study, ways to work with the influence of endogenous factors (keywords, language settings, geo-location, Web history and clicking behaviour) and mitigate the effects of the exogenous factors (experimentation and randomisation) are suggested. Then, a new approach to studying search results is put forward, which builds on purposeful sampling of real-world participants or constructed research profiles. Finally, perspectives for news and journalism scholars in studying algorithmically generated content in a broader context are offered.","[Ormen, Jacob] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Media Cognit & Commun, DK-1168 Copenhagen, Denmark",,"Ormen, J (corresponding author), Univ Copenhagen, Dept Media Cognit & Commun, DK-1168 Copenhagen, Denmark.",dcs499@hum.ku.dk,,"Ormen, Jacob/0000-0003-4807-8395",,,,,44,16,16,1,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

Results show that, when presented alone, images generate stronger framing effects on opinions and behavioral intentions than text. When images and text are presented together, as in a typical news report, the frame carried by the text influences opinions regardless of the accompanying image, whereas the frame carried by the image drives behavioral intentions irrespective of the linked text. These effects are explained by the salience enhancing and emotional consequences of visuals.","[Powell, Thomas E.; Boomgaarden, Hajo G.; De Swert, Knut; de Vreese, Claes H.] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Sch Commun Res, Dept Commun Sci, NL-1001 NG Amsterdam, Netherlands",,"Powell, TE (corresponding author), Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Sch Commun Res, Dept Commun Sci, NL-1001 NG Amsterdam, Netherlands.",t.e.powell@uva.nl,"De Swert, Knut/AAB-6715-2021","Boomgaarden, Hajo G./0000-0002-5260-1284",Amsterdam School of Communication Research,Amsterdam School of Communication Research,This research was funded by the Amsterdam School of Communication Research.,,58,130,132,12,100,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0021-9916,1460-2466,,J COMMUN,J.

Between 1974 and 2011, the level of democracy increased in 62 countries following the adoption of a new constitution, but decreased or stayed the same in 70 others. Using data covering all 138 new constitutions in 118 countries during that period, we explain this divergence through empirical tests showing that overall increased participation during the process of making the constitution positively impacts postpromulgation levels of democracy. Then, after disaggregating constitution-making into three stages (drafting, debating, and ratification) we find compelling evidence through robust statistical tests that the degree of citizen participation in the drafting stage has amuch greater impact on the resulting regime. This lends support to some core principles of deliberative theories of democracy. We conclude that constitutional reformers should focus more on generating public buy in at the front end of the constitution-making process, rather than concentrating on ratification and referendums at the back end that are unlikely to correct for an original sin of limited citizen deliberation during drafting.","[Eisenstadt, Todd A.] Amer Univ, Dept Govt, Sch Publ Affairs, Washington, DC 20016 USA; [Levan, A.

Previous research has found that the participant who initiated a conversation preferably also initiates its termination with a possible preclosing. Advice acknowledgments, lying in the epistemic domain of the client, are devices that may work as preclosings. However, in text-based chat clients regularly refrain from advice acknowledgment. While counselors use various practices to elicit advice acknowledgment in the context of potential advice resistance, hoaxing, and/or seemingly long pauses, these questions do not always succeed as closing devices. This offers an explanation for counselors' perception of online chatting as more difficult than calling.

Possible explanations for divergent outcomes include learner individual differences, goals and foci of instruction, type and duration of instructional input, and assessment procedures. After identifying key concepts, we survey 75 L2 pronunciation studies, particularly their methods and results. Despite a move towards emphasizing speech intelligibility and comprehensibility, most research surveyed promoted native-like pronunciation as the target. Although most studies entailed classroom instruction, many featured Computer Assisted Pronunciation Teaching (CAPT). Segmentals were studied more often than suprasegmentals. The amount of instruction required to effect change was related to researchers' goals; interventions focusing on a single feature were generally shorter than those addressing more issues. Reading-aloud tasks were the most common form of assessment; very few studies measured spontaneous speech. The attribution of improvement as a result of instruction was compromised in some instances by lack of a control group.

To address this gap, a laboratory experiment was conducted in which we tested the relationship between task complexity and the emergence of transformational leadership behavior. In this experiment, 111 participants were divided in groups of three (comprising one leader and two subordinates), and were instructed to solve three decision-making tasks with varying levels of task complexity. Results indicated that task complexity was negatively related to transformational leadership behavior, and that this relationship was partially mediated by the leader's state core self-evaluations. In other words, when leaders encounter tasks that are overwhelmingly complex, they act in less transformational ways because they momentarily lack the psychological resources to do so.

We examine the effects of framing on evaluations when audiences are exposed to a multiplicity of frames, both by the same actor as the result of recurrent communications over time and by multiple actors who vie for attention. Using 36,012 research reports by securities analysts, covering the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industry between 1989 and 2012, we tested the relationships between analysts' framing repertoires and professional investors' evaluations of analysts as measured in the publication of Institutional Investor's short list of the best analysts of the year. We found that investors appreciate analysts with framing repertoires that resonate with their needs, that are internally coherent over time, and that offer a moderate amount of novelty in comparison to others' framings. We also found that framing is particularly important for analysts without existing high status, that is, who have never before been recognized as stars or who cannot benefit from association with a prestigious employer.","[Giorgi, Simona] Boston Coll, Carroll Sch Management, Management & Org, Chestnut Hill, MA 02467 USA; [Weber, Klaus] Northwestern Univ, Kellogg Sch Management, Management & Org, Evanston, IL 60208 USA",,"Giorgi, S (corresponding author), Boston Coll, Carroll Sch Management, Management & Org, 140 Commonwealth Ave, Chestnut Hill, MA 02467 USA.",simona.giorgi@bc.edu; klausweber@northwestern.edu,"Giorgi, Simona/I-3383-2014; Weber, Klaus/P-7387-2015","Giorgi, Simona/0000-0002-2905-5107; Weber, Klaus/0000-0002-4460-4733",,,,,150,52,52,2,90,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0001-8392,1930-3815,,ADMIN SCI QUART,Adm.

However, diagnostic procedures in the broader sense have been inadequately theorized to date, with the result that there is still little agreement on precisely what diagnosis in second and foreign language learning actually entails. In order to address this problem, this article investigated how diagnosis is theorized and carried out in a diverse range of professions with a view to finding commonalities that can be applied to the context of language assessment. Ten semi-structured interviews were conducted with professionals from the fields of car mechanics, IT systems support, medicine, psychology and education. Data were then coded, yielding five macro-categories that fit the entire data set: (i) definitions of diagnosis, (ii) means of diagnosis,(iii) key players, (iv) diagnostic procedures, (v) treatment/follow-up. Based on findings within these categories, a set of five tentative principles of diagnostic language assessment is drawn-up, as well as a list of implications for future research.","[Alderson, J.

Yet numerous textsincluding a recently reconstituted work about the law of warshow that he thought very seriously about the question of the nature and origin of war and of the possibility of making war subject to the rule of law. Rousseau, in contrast to Hobbes, links war's appearance to that of the sovereign states; the state of war is therefore the necessary result of international relations. Moreover, he considers the international law as chimerical. How can he then conceive a non-utopian theory of just war? My hypothesis is that his conception of the law of war is deduced from principles of internal political law and arises from pragmatic necessity. The state that discredits itself in its manner of waging war weakens itself while believing that it is reinforcing itself.","Univ Cergy Pontoise, Ctr Philosophie Jurid & Polit, Cergy Pontoise, France",,"Bachofen, B (corresponding author), Univ Cergy Pontoise, Ctr Philosophie Jurid & Polit, Cergy Pontoise, France.",blaise.bachofen@u-cergy.fr,,,,,,,57,4,4,0,9,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0003-0554,1537-5943,,AM POLIT SCI REV,Am.

J,"Nao, M",,,,"Nao, Marion",,,'So You Are from England': Categorization and Cultural Reduction in First-time Conversation Lounge Encounters between Foreign Teachers and Japanese Students of EFL,APPLIED LINGUISTICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,MEMBERSHIP CATEGORIZATION,"The article explores 'culture talk' at the outset of first-time encounters between teachers and students of English as a foreign language in the conversation lounge of a Japanese university. It analyses the interactional procedures by which the foreign place of origin of the teacher becomes the topic of conversation following his or her initial categorization by the Japanese students, for example, so you are from England'. In doing so, it draws on Maynard and Zimmerman's (1984) analytic framework of pre-topical sequences used by unacquainted participants to uncover other-identifying information. This is reclassified to accommodate the prior knowledge of the Japanese students of the teachers' foreign origins, as emergent in categorization. Having been granted the pre-allocated right to nominate topic through guidelines on use of the lounge, the students further adopt a wanting-to-know framing of conversation, by which they orient to the teacher's own expertise, as rooted in his or her biographical information preserve (Goffman 1971). Knowledge of the foreign country is seen to be asymmetrically distributed by the participants, with observably reductive effects on both interactional dynamics and cultural representation.",,,,marion@consultingnao.co.uk,,"Nao, Marion/0000-0001-6300-4867",ESRC [PTA-026-27-2648]; ESRC [ES/H047093/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H047093/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"The author acknowledges the ESRC as the awarders of a postdoctoral fellowship (PTA-026-27-2648), hosted by Linguistics and English Language at the University of Edinburgh, which allowed her to disseminate her research.

This article applies recent conversation analytical work on epistemics to classrooms where language and content instruction are combined. It focuses on Epistemic Search Sequences (ESSs) through which students in peer interaction collectively resolve emerging knowledge gaps while working on pedagogic tasks. ESSs are initiated when a speaker displays an 'unknowing' epistemic stance by making an information request about some aspect of language or the content being worked on. We examine three different types of ESS: those in which a 'knowing' response is accepted by the initiator of the sequence; those in which there is an 'unknowing' response; and those where 'knowing' responses are contested. The findings have implications for understanding peer interaction in content-based classrooms in three areas: the affordances of peer interaction for learning in contrast with teacher-led 'known-answer' sequences; how learners manage rights and responsibilities around knowing or not knowing; and how learners discover and work on their own learning objects.","[Jakonen, Teppo] Univ Jyvaskyla, Ctr Appl Language Studies, Jyvaskyla, Finland; [Morton, Tom] Univ London, Dept Appl Linguist & Commun, London, England",,"Jakonen, T (corresponding author), Univ Jyvaskyla, Ctr Appl Language Studies, Jyvaskyla, Finland.",teppo.jakonen@jyu.fi,"Morton, Tom/AAA-1243-2020","Morton, Tom/0000-0002-5102-0445; Jakonen, Teppo/0000-0002-7250-0042",project ConCLIL - Language and content integration: towards a conceptual framework; Academy of Finland,project ConCLIL - Language and content integration: towards a conceptual framework; Academy of Finland(Academy of Finland),"This work was supported by the project ConCLIL - Language and content integration: towards a conceptual framework (2011-2014), led by Prof. Tarja Nikula, and funded by the Academy of Finland.

The research builds upon (i) research on multilingual advertising by investigating its attitudinal correlates, and (ii) studies on advertising to bilinguals through the verification of the presence of processing fluency effects among Italian English bilinguals in Australia. Results drawn from a focus group show that attitudes towards the two languages are shaped both by the consideration of the audience's bilingualism and the socio-psychological features the languages carry. Further data collected through a 2 (language of advertisements: English versus Italian) x 2 (language dominance: English versus Italian) between-subject experiment particularize these findings. A total of 103 circumstantial bilinguals of Italian descent evaluated four print advertisements. Arguably due to their high level of proficiency, subjects do not experience any processing fluency effect when exposed to advertising in their dominant language. On the contrary, English dominants respond more favourably to messages in Italian whereas Italian dominants respond more favourably to messages in English.","Univ Sydney, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia",,"Santello, M (corresponding author), Univ Sydney, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",m.santello@sydney.edu.au,,,,,,,94,11,11,2,27,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0142-6001,1477-450X,,APPL LINGUIST,Appl.

J,"Bodker, H",,,,"Bodker, Henrik",,,JOURNALISM AS CULTURES OF CIRCULATION,DIGITAL JOURNALISM,,,English,Article,,,,,,circulation; iconicity; journalism; layering; participation; temporality,NEWS,"The universe of journalism has always consisted of interspersed texts, practices and meanings. Yet, much journalism research has often isolated either texts and/or contexts and thus assumed relations between professional practices, informed (rational) readers and (conceived) core texts. It is, however, more important than ever to shift attention away from texts to the processes through which they are circulated. This is partly because the many cultural forms of journalism (textual, institutional, technological, material, behavioural and imagined) are undergoing significant changes, one of which is being interrelated in new and increasingly complex ways. To understand some of the related processes, this article proposes a notion of circulation that implies a close attention to the ways in which the various forms of this landscape travel, intertwine and connect and, in particular, to the ways in which these forms construct and maintain what is termed cultures of circulation. In order to approach such processes, this article traces the photographic mediation of a specific event with the overall aim of beginning a theorization of the landscape of journalism as interrelated cultures of circulation.","[Bodker, Henrik] Aarhus Univ, Dept Aesthet & Commun, Aarhus C, Denmark",,"Bodker, H (corresponding author), Aarhus Univ, Dept Aesthet & Commun, Aarhus C, Denmark.",imvhb@dac.au.dk,,,,,,,25,15,15,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

Previous research has highlighted how elite media, journalism education institutions, and other interest groups take part in the emergence and evolution of data journalism. But has it equally gained momentum in smaller, less-scrutinized media markets? This paper looks at the ascent of data journalism in the French-speaking part of Belgium. It argues that journalism, and hence data journalism, can be understood as a socio-discursive practice: it is not only the production of (data-driven) journalistic artefacts that shapes the notion of (data) journalism, but also the discursive efforts of all the actors involved, in and out of the newsrooms. A set of qualitative inquiries allowed us to examine the phenomenon by first establishing a cartography of who and what counts as data journalism. It uncovers an overall reliance on a handful of passionate individuals, only partly backed up institutionally, and a limited amount of consensual references that could foster a shared interpretive community. A closer examination of the definitions reveal a sharp polyphony that is particularly polarized around the duality of the term itself, divided between a focus on data and a focus on journalism, and torn between the co-existing notions of ordinary and thorough data journalism. We also describe what is perceived as obstacles, which mostly pertain to broader traits that shape contemporary news-making; and explain why, if data journalism clearly exists as a matter of concern, it has not transformed in concrete undertakings.","[De Maeyer, Juliette] Univ Montreal, Dept Commun, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Libert, Manon; Domingo, David; Heinderyckx, Francois; Le Cam, Florence] Univ Libre Bruxelles, Dept Informat & Commun Sci, Brussels, Belgium; [Heinderyckx, Francois] Commun Univ China, Beijing, Peoples R China",,"De Maeyer, J (corresponding author), Univ Montreal, Dept Commun, Montreal, PQ, Canada.",juliette.de.maeyer@umontreal.ca; manon.libert@ulb.ac.be; david.domingo@ulb.ac.be; fheinder@ulb.ac.be; flecam@ulb.ac.be,"Heinderyckx, Francois/B-6353-2011","Heinderyckx, Francois/0000-0003-3710-6098",,,,,22,75,78,3,35,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

This article explores this idea of de-boundedness and discusses the question whether there is anything more behind it than a catch-all diagnosis for the processes of change and transformation in the circumstances of communication in society, in general, and for journalism, in particular. To this end, de-boundedness as a proposition initially receives a more concrete definition. Its foundations in theories of differentiation and especially in the theory of social systems by the German sociologist Niklas Luhmann will be discussed, where differentiation, that is, drawing lines of demarcation, is the essential factor. It is shown that systems theory provides different possibilities for characterizing forms of de-differentiation or blurring boundaries. Within systems theory they can be interpreted in terms of the evolutionary emergence of new forms of journalism, the co-evolutionary processes between journalism and its environment and/or as interpenetrations of journalism with other societal systems. It is demonstrated that changes in journalism oscillate between differentiation and de-differentiation, so that it can be described as a (de-) differentiated phenomenon.","[Loosen, Wiebke] Univ Hamburg, Hans Bredow Inst Media Res, Hamburg, Germany",,"Loosen, W (corresponding author), Univ Hamburg, Hans Bredow Inst Media Res, Hamburg, Germany.",w.loosen@hans-bredow-institut.de,,"Loosen, Wiebke/0000-0002-2211-2260",,,,,62,24,24,0,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.
